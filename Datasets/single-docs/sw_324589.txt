Numazu, Shizuoka

It has been recognized as a special city since 2000.

In the Edo period, "Numazu-juku" and "Hara-juku" was the 12th and 13th of 53 shogunate-maintained waystations ("shuku-eki") along the Tōkaidō road which connected Edo and Kyoto. Both Tōkaidō rest stops are within the boundaries of modern Numazu.
