Birthplace of Ronald Reagan

The Birthplace of Ronald Reagan, also known as the Graham Building, is located in an apartment on the second floor of a late 19th-century commercial building in Tampico, Illinois, United States. The building was built in 1896 and housed a tavern from that time until 1915. 

On February 6, 1911 the future 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, was born in the apartment there, the family moving into a house in Tampico a few months later. 

Architecturally, the two story brick building is similar to its neighbors, all of which are part of a historic district added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
