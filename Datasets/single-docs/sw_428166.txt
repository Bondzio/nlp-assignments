Chesapeake Bay Bridge

The Chesapeake Bay Bridge (called the Bay Bridge by locals) is a bridge that crosses Chesapeake Bay, on the eastern coast of the United States. The bridge is long. It serves as a connecting route between the eastern and western shores of Maryland. The bridge was named after William Preston Lane Jr., the governor at the time that the building of the bridge was ordered.

A toll of six dollars is charged on the one-way toll side of the bridge (the side opposite of the Eastern Shore). Although for taxi services the fee is anywhere from 25 to 30 dollars.

The bridge was first proposed for building in 1938. Building did not begin until 1947 because of the United States' involvement in World War II. The bridge was finally opened to traffic on July 30, 1952. Later in 1967, because traffic on the bridge was increasing, another side for the bridge was proposed. The proposal was agreed to, and funded by the state of Maryland. Building began once again in 1969 and was completed in 1973.

Today the Bridge is considered one of the most dangerous bridges in the world because of the accidents that have happened on it.
