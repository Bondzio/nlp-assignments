Verse

In poetry a verse is technically a single line in a poem. A poem is a "metrical composition".

However, in common use, a verse is a group of lines in a poem which make up a paragraph. It consists of several lines, either in print for reading, or in a song. In the poems and theatre of Ancient Greece these units were called strophes.
