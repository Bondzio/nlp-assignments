Chilean Antarctic Territory

The Chilean Antarctic Territory is the territory in Antarctica claimed by Chile since 1940. The Chilean Antarctic Territory overlaps Argentine and British Antarctic claims.

Within Chilean territorial organization Antártica is the name of the commune that administers the territory. Belongs to Antártica Chilena Province, which is part of Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region. The commune of Antártica was created on July 11, 1961, and was dependent on the Magallanes Province until 1975, when the Antártica Chilena Province was created, making it dependent administratively on Puerto Williams, the province capital.

The Antarctic Treaty Freezed all the Antartic claims.
