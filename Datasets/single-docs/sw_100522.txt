Reign of Terror

The Reign of Terror or simply The Terror was a period of about 11 months during the French Revolution. During this time, French people who did not support the revolution were executed at the guillotine.

The Reign of Terror started on 5 September, 1793. The violence happened more and more often in June and July of 1794, a period called "la Grande Terreur" (The Great Terror), which ended 27 July 1794, when several important leaders of the Reign of Terror were executed, including Saint-Just and Robespierre. The Terror took the lives of between 18,500 to 40,000 people.

Robespierre died due to the Thermidorian Reaction. This was a revolt against the revolution otherwise called a counter-revolution. Robespierre was guillotined.

After the Reign of Terror, Napoleon Bonaparte rose to be the emperor of France. This showed France was weak.
