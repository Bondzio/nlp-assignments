Paul Aussaresses

Paul Aussaresses (7 November 1918 â€“ 4 December 2013) was a French Army general. He fought during World War II, the First Indochina War and Algerian War. His actions during the Algerian War, and later defense of those actions, caused considerable controversy. He was perhaps best known for wearing an eye patch since he lost an eye during battle. 

Aussaresses was badly criticized in 2000, when in an interview with the French newspaper "Le Monde", he defended the use of torture during the Algerian war. He repeated the defense in an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes", further arguing that torture ought to be used in the fight against Al-Qaeda.

Aussaresses died on 4 December 2013 from natural causes in La Vancelle, France, aged 95.
