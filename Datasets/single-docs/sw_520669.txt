Thomas Blatt

Thomas "Toivi" Blatt (born Tomasz Blatt; April 15, 1927 â€“ October 31, 2015) was a Polish-American writer and speaker. At the age of 16, Blatt was one of the few Jewish people to survive an uprising and escape from the Sobibor extermination camp in October 1943. 

Following the World War II he settled in the United States. Blatt later wrote two books about Sobibor. His memoir, "From The Ashes of Sobibor" (1997), is about his experience in the camp. He also wrote "Sobibor, the Forgotten Revolt" (1997), a history based on his years of research.

Blatt died at his home in Santa Barbara, California on October 31, 2015 at the age of 88.
