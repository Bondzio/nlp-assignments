Counting the cost

Counting the cost is the name of a pair of parables Jesus told. The two parables are written in the New Testament in Luke 14:25-33. 

Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:
The disciples of Jesus gave up everything they had for the kingdom of God, even their lives. Fidelity to "God's salvific aim" meant putting family and possessions second. Christians believe the cost of being a disciple is worth the promised rewards.
