Guillain–Barré syndrome

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), sometimes Landry's paralysis or Guillain–Barré–Strohl syndrome is a syndrome that causes weakness of the feet and hands. Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at 1–2 cases per 100,000 people annually, but is the most common cause of acute non-trauma-related paralysis. The syndrome is named after the French physicians Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it in 1916.
