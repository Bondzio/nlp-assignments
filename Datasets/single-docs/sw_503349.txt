Comminges

The Comminges is a natural region in southern France, near the Pyrenees. It contains the upper valley of the Garonne, one of France's four great rivers. It is one of the oldest inhabited places in France. Before the French Revolution it was a county of the historical region of Gascony. It was named for the ancient tribe the "Convenae". They were a Celtic tribe living in and around Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges by at least the 1st century BC.
