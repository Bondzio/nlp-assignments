Mug shot

A mug shot, or booking photograph, is a photographic portrait taken after someone is arrested. The mug shot is taken to allow law enforcement to have a photographic record of the arrested person to allow for identification by victims and investigators. Most mug shots are two-part, with one side-view photo, and one front-view.
