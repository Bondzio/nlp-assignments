Tribe

A tribe is a group of people who live and work together. A "tribal society" is a group of tribes organized around kinships. Tribes represent a part in social evolution between bands and nations.
A tribe can be a collection of families or of families and individual people living together. A tribe usually divides up the jobs that need to be done among themselves. Most tribes have special customs or traditions.

Tribes are the type of groups humans lived in before they started living in cities and nations. There are still tribal groups all over the world. Their numbers are getting smaller and smaller.
