Serbia at the Olympics

Serbia was first at the Olympic Games in 1912. After 96 years, Serbia returned to the Olympics as an independent team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. From 1920 to the 1992 Winter Olympics Serbian athletes were part of the Yugoslavian team. At the 1992 Summer Olympics they took part as Independent Olympic Participants. This was because the United Nations was threatening to punish Serbia. Because of this, no Serbians were at the 1994 Winter Olympics. The threats stopped in 1995. From the 1996 Summer Olympics to the 2006 Winter Olympics they were part of the Serbia and Montenegro team.
