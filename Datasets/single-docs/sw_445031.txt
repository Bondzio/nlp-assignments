Delta-v

Delta-v, or Î”"v"," "(literally, the change in speed)" "in astrodynamics, (how spacecraft move in space) is a measure of the amount of effort (pushing power) needed to change a craft's trajectory (how it's going to move from now on) in space. It is measured by a unit of speed.

Most of the time, a propellant burned by an engine provides the needed thrust.

Delta-v is calculated in meters per second of thrust, or m/s. 

For example, to reach Low Earth orbit, (LEO) a spacecraft generally needs about 9,300 to 10,000 m/s of thrust.
