Fools Garden

Fools Garden is a German musical group. It was formed in 1991 under the name Fool's Garden. They started in 1991 with the album "Fool's Garden". The offical first album which included the complete band was "Once in a Blue Moon" (1993). Two years later, Fool's Garden released their third album "Dish of the Day", which scored a hit on the music charts in Europe and Asia with "Lemon Tree". The re-released track peaked at #26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1996.

"Go And Ask Peggy For The Principal Thing" followed in 1997, along with three more albums in 2000, 2003 and 2005. In 2003, three members left the band, and were replaced by Dirk Blümlein (bassist), Claus Müller (drummer) and Gabriel Holz (second guitarist, who then left the band in 2007). The name of the band was changed to Fools Garden (without the apostrophe).

The band has released cover-versions of rock and roll songs during live performances (The Beatles' "Ticket to Ride" or The Who's "My Generation"). Fools Garden's interest in The Beatles's led them to put cover versions of songs "Cry Baby Cry" and "Martha My Dear" on their studio albums.

The band released a greatest hits compilation album in October 2009. The album, "High Times", contained fifteen songs. They included a brand new song, "High Time", and some of the well-known hits re-recorded with the new band ("Lemon Tree", "Wild Days", "Suzy").

The latest album "Who Is Jo King?" was released in October 2012.
