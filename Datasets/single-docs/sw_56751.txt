Multiset

A multiset (sometimes called a bag) is a concept from mathematics. In many ways, multisets are like sets. Certain items are either elements of that multiset, or they are not. However, multisets are different from sets: The same type of item can be in the multiset more than once. For this reason, mathematicians have defined a relation (function) that tells, how many copies of a certain type of item there are in a certain multiset. They call this "multiplicity". For example, in the multiset { "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c" }, the multiplicities of the members "a", "b", and "c" are respectively 2, 3, and 1. 

A multiset is illustrated by means of a histogram.

A multiset can also be considered an unordered tuple:

One of the simplest examples is the multiset of prime factors of a number "n". Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime divisors of "n". For example the number "120" has the prime factorisation
which gives the multiset {2, 2, 2, 3, 5}.

Another is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation. A quadratic equation, for example, has two solutions. However, in some cases they are both the same number. Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be { 3, 5 }, or it could be { 4, 4 }. In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2.
