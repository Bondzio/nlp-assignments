Rated R (album)

Rated R is the fourth studio album by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. It was released in November 2009 by Def Jam Recordings. Musically, the album is a departure from her 2007 album "Good Girl Gone Bad", "Rated R" features a dark theme compared to her previous albums and features a wide range of genres such as pop, hip hop and R&B. It recorded after Rihanna's assault by her then-boyfriend, fellow R&B singer Chris Brown in the beginning of 2009.
