Triglyceride

A triglyceride is a type of ester that comes from glycerol and three fatty acids. Triglycerides are a type of lipid found in the blood. They help enable the movement of adipose fat and glucose from the liver. Triglycerides are the main molecules that make up vegetable oil and animal fats. They are also a major component of oils found on human skin (sebum).
