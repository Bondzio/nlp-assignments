Wembley Stadium

Wembley Stadium is a football stadium in London, England. It was built from 2003 to 2007 in the same spot that the first Wembley Stadium was built. It holds 90,000 seats. The new stadium features an arch that was designed not to cast a shadow over the stadium while games are played and to help hold part of the roof up. The FA Cup final is played at and both FA Cup semi-finals as well. It also hosts the League Cup final and several other English cup finals. The England national football team play their home matches here.

As well as sports, the new Wembley Stadium, like the first one, is also used for concerts. Metallica, Muse, and George Michael have performed there. Also, the Concert for Diana was held there on July 1, 2007, and the London Live Earth concert was held there six days later, on July 7.

The new Wembley also hosts NFL games as part of the NFL International Series. The first NFL game there was the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. The Jacksonville Jaguars currently have a deal to play one home game in London from 2013 to 2020.
