Alice Cooper

Alice Cooper (born February 4, 1948) is an American rock musician and singer. Originally, there was a band called Alice Cooper led by a singer named Vincent Damon Furnier. The band was one of the creators of a very theatrical and violent type of heavy metal music that was designed to shock and would come to be known as "shock rock."

In 1974, Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and started making solo music. Cooper's solo career began with the 1975 album "Welcome to My Nightmare". Over the years Cooper has played many different musical styles.

Alice Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage. "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" referred to him as the world's most ""beloved"" heavy metal entertainer. He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal. Cooper is also credited as being one of the first to bring movie-like looks to the rock concert stage in the late 1960s.

Away from music, Cooper is also an actor, a golfer, a restaurant owner and a popular radio DJ.
