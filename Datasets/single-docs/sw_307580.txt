Bioorganic chemistry

Bioorganic chemistry is a science that combines organic chemistry and biochemistry. Bioorganic chemistry expands organic chemistry towards biology. This differs from biochemistry, which studies biological processes using chemistry. When investigating enzymes and cofactors, bioorganic chemistry overlaps bioinorganic chemistry.

Biophysical organic chemistry is a term used when attempting to describe intimate details of molecular recognition by bioorganic chemistry. 

Bioorganic chemistry is that branch of life science, which deals with the study of biological processes using chemical methods.
