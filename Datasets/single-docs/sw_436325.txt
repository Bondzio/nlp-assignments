Marple Hall School

Marple Hall School is a specialist language college in Marple, Greater Manchester, England. The headteacher is Mr. Joseph Barker. The school is on the outskirts of Greater Manchester, near the River Goyt.

Marple Hall was a manor house once owned by John Bradshaw. Born at Marple Hall, Bradshaw was first a clerk, then a lawyer. After the English Civil War he was the first to sign the death warrant of Charles I of England. The house was later owned by the Isherwood family. The ruins of the house are still near the grounds of the school. Two of the modern buildings are named for these two. In 1960 a grammar school was built on the grounds of the manor. In 1965 the school had separate schools for boy and girls. In 1974 it became Marple Hall County High School. This school is for both boys and girls.
