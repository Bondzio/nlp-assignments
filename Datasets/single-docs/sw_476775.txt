A6 center

A6 center is a shopping mall in the town of Jönköping in Sweden. The shopping mall was opened on 2 April 1987. That was following the 1985 disestablishment of the Småland Artillery Regiment.

The shopping mall is located on both the northern and the southern side of the E4 motorway. These parts are connected with a covered bridge that spans across the motorway. Major parts of the shopping mall are located at this bridge. The bridge also houses McDonald’s restaurant. From that restaurant, the motorway can be seen.
