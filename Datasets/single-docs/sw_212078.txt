Brawn GP

Brawn GP Formula One Team, was a Formula One motor racing team. Brawn GP started on the 6th of March 2009 when Ross Brawn, the old team leader for Honda, Ferrari and Benetton, bought the team. On 17 March 2009 the FIA agreed to change the name from Honda Racing F1 Team to Brawn GP. Even though the team is only the Honda team with a new name, the FIA considered Brawn GP to be a new team, but agreed to let the join F1 for free instead of the usual price.

The new team first raced at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix on 28 March 2009, where they took 1st and 2nd place in qualifying. The team went on to win the top two positions in their debut Grand Prix race on 29 March 2009, with Jenson Button winning the race and Rubens Barrichello coming in second. 

The team used Mercedes-Benz engines and its cars were driven by the old Honda team of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, which has lasted for 3 years. In the early part of the season, several other sponsors were signed, including Virgin, M I G Investments, Henri Lloyd and PerkinElmer.

On 18 October 2009, at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Button won the 2009 Drivers' Title on his first season for Brawn GP. He and the other driver Barrichello got points to win Brawn the Constructors Championship on its first season.

The following month Mercedes, after leaving the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes F1 Team, bought a lot of Brawn GP and changed its name to Mercedes GP for the 2010 season.
