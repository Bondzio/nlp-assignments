Jewish Publication Society of America Version

The Jewish Publication Society of America Version (JPS 1917) of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) was the first Bible translation published by the Jewish Publication Society of America and the first translation of the Tanakh into English by a group of Jews (though there had been earlier solo tries, such as that of Isaac Leeser). The full publication title is "The Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text: A New Translation with the Aid of Previous Versions and with Constant Consultation of Jewish Authorities".
