Sexting

Sexting is the act of sending sexually suggestive electronic messages, mainly between mobile phones. The term became popular during the early 21st century. The term is a portmanteau of "sex" and "texting".

The term was first used in print in 2005 in Australia. A naked picture that you make of yourself is sometimes called a nelfie, a mix of the words naked and selfie.
