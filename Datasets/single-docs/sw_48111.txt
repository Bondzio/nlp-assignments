Old English

The Old English language, often called Anglo-Saxon, was spoken in England from 450 to 1100 . It was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons who came to England from what is now Germany and Denmark. 

Old English is very different from Modern English; it has many more Germanic words. It was rarely written down, and when written it was in runes. This is an alphabet completely different from the Latin alphabet used for English today. Old English grammar is difficult, and close to Old German. Latin was used by churchmen like the venerable Bede. Old English gradually turned into Middle English after the Norman Conquest of 1066.

"Beowulf" is written in Old English in an alphabetic scrip
