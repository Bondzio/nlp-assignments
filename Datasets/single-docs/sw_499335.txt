Division of Balaclava

The Division of Balaclava was an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. It was set up for the first federal election in 1901. It was named for the suburb of Balaclava, which in turn was named for a battlefield of the Crimean War. It included the wealthy inner southern suburbs of Melbourne, including Brighton and Sandringham. It was abolished and replaced by the Division of Goldstein in 1984.

Thomas White, the Air and Civil Aviation Minister, resigned to become Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. This caused a by-election. Percy Joske resigned in 1960 to become Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, which also caused a by-election.
