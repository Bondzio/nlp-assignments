Rainier III, Prince of Monaco

Rainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi (31 May 1923 â€“ 6 April 2005), also known as Rainier III, ruled the Principality of Monaco for almost 56 years. He was one of the longest ruling monarchs in European history. His family has ruled Monaco for seven centuries. Prince Rainier was internationally known due to his marriage to the American actress Grace Kelly. He was responsible for reforms to the Constitution of Monaco. He expanded the principality's economy beyond its traditional casino gambling base. Gambling accounts for about three percent of the nation's annual revenue today. When Rainier became the prince in 1949, it accounted for more than 95 percent.
