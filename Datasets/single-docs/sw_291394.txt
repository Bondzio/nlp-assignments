Operation Sea Lion

Operation Sea Lion () was the plan to invade the United Kingdom by the Nazis during World War II. The plan began in 1940. However, Germany first had to control the sky and sea of the English Channel before a land invasion. With the German Air Force defeated in the Battle of Britain, the operation was put off on 17 September 1940 and never happened.

The invasion force would have used a varied amount of weapons, developing underwater tanks, the first Jet powered airplane, and a massive underwater army armed with old an innovative Scuba Suits.
