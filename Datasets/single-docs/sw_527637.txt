Automotive lighting

The lighting system of a motor vehicle consists of lighting and signalling devices mounted on the front, rear, sides, and in some cases the top of a motor vehicle. This lights the roadway for the driver. The lighting system also makes the vehicle more visible especially in low light conditions. It gives warning to other drivers and [pedestrian]]s of a vehicle's presence and direction of travel. Emergency vehicles usually carry distinctive lighting equipment to alert drivers and pedestrians of their rapid movement during an emergency.

Vehicles have had lights for well over a hundred years. Candles lit Horse-drawn carriages. The first cars, then called "horseless-carriages" were lit by gas lights. By 1908 electric lighting began to be used on motor vehicles. Red tail lights and yellow brake lights were in use by 1915. Sealed beam headlights were used starting in 1936. By 1940 turn signals were used. In 1960 the first halogen lights were used on European cars and the technology came to the US by 1979. Replaceable car light bulbs were in use in the US beginning in 1983.
