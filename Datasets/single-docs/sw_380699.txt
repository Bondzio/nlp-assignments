Screaming Trees

Screaming Trees were an American grunge band from Ellensburg, Washington. 

The band was formed in 1985 by brothers Gary Lee Conner and Van Conner. The band formed because the members had an interest in the punk, garage, and classic rock genres in high school. 

They released their debut album, "Clairvoyance", on January 1, 1986. The band gained fame from the early 1990s grunge movement along with bands like Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. The band broke up in 2000.
