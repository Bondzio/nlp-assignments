Arc de Triomphe

The Arc de Triomphe (meaning "arch of victory)", at the centre of the place de l'Étoile and the western end of the Champs-Elysées, is a very famous monument in Paris.

Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte commissioned it in 1806 after victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. It is a large arch, but it is not possible to drive underneath it. Jean-François Chalgrin designed it, and it has roughly 300 steps that lead to the top. It has four main sculptures and six reliefs. Just beneath the vault of the arch, there is the tomb of the unknown soldier. The names of French generals and battles are engraved on the walls.
