Kate Edger

Kate Milligan Evans Edger (January 6, 1857 to May 6, 1935) was the first woman in New Zealand to get a university degree and the first woman in the British Empire to get a Bachelor of Arts degree.

Edger's family moved from England to New Zealand in 1862. On 11 July 1877, she graduated from the University of New Zealand.

The Kate Edger Educational Charitable Trust gives financial assistance for women to get undergraduate or postgraduate degrees. In 2004 the Kate Edger Information Commons was formed at The University of Auckland.
