Ball (dance)

A Ball is a formal dance occasion. By formal is meant: people were invited, wore their best clothes ('evening attire'), and the ball was held in a splendid ballroom. In former times everyone danced, but only the wealthy went to balls. Girls had dance cards: men had to book dances with them. Older people sat round the sides and watched the younger people dance. It was a society occasion.
