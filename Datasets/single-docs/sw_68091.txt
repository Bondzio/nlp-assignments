Libra is an astrological sign, related to the constellation Libra, in the Southern Hemisphere near Scorpius and Virgo. In the tropical zodiac, the Sun meets Libra from September 23 to October 23, and in the sidereal zodiac, it ends on November 15. Libra, (The Scales of Balance), is the only symbol of the zodiac that is inanimate (it is not represented by an animal or person). The opposite sign to Libra is Aries.

The corresponding month in the Babylonian calendar is "Ti≈°ritum", made for Shamash (the Sun).

Libra's symbol, the scales, is the only symbol in the zodiac that is not represented by an animal or person.
