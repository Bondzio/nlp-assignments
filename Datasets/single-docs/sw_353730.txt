Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile

The Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile (AIMAC, in English International Academy Mohammed VI of Civil Aviation) is a public aviation university created in 2000 by the King Mohammed VI of Morocco for aerospace education in this country, like Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel training.

The French Civil Aviation University (ENAC) of Toulouse is close to the university by a partnership agreement, in particularly for air navigation courses. In December 2011, the academy has lauched with this "grande école" and the "École des Ponts ParisTech" an aviation MBA at Casablanca. The Federal Aviation Administration is also a partner of AIMAC, in particular for the launch of common e-learning courses.
