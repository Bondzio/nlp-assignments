Tesla (unit)

The tesla (symbol T) is the SI derived unit used to measure magnetic fields. Tesla can be measured in different ways; for example, one tesla is equal to one weber per square meter.

The tesla was first defined in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). It was named in honor of the physicist, electrical engineer, and inventor, Nikola Tesla.

Using only the seven base SI units, the definition of a tesla is:

Using other SI derived units, a tesla is also equal to:
The units used are:

A = ampere
<br>C = coulomb
<br>kg = kilogram
<br>m = meter
<br>N = newton
<br>s = second
<br>T = tesla
<br>V = volt
<br>Wb = weber

A tesla is also equal to 10,000 (10) gauss in the CGS system of units.
