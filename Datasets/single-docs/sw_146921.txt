God is dead

"God is dead" (German: ; also known as the death of God) is a well known phrase by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. 

Friedrich Nietzsche wrote this in his book "The Gay Science". It is also found in Nietzsche's classic work "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" (Deutsch: "Also sprach Zarathustra"), which is most responsible for popularizing the phrase. 

The phrase is not meant literally.

The idea is stated in "The Madman" as follows
"God is dead" does not mean that Nietzsche believed in an actual God who first existed and then died in a literal sense. It refers to the growth of non-believers in supposedly Christian countries.

"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands". This is why in "The Madman", the passage quoted above mainly addresses nontheists (especially atheists). Their problem (according to Nietzsche) is to retain any system of values without a divine order.
