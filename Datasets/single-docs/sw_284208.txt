Fiji Hindi

Fiji Hindi is an Indo-Aryan language which is the mother tongue of 313,000 people of Indian origin in Fiji.

This language is very different from the standard Hindi spoken in India and the relationship between the two languages ​​are similar to those between Dutch and Afrikaans. The language is composed of the Eastern Hindi dialects (Bhojpuri and Awadhi) with numerous English and Fijian words. It is spoken with a Pacific twang. 

In recent times, due to the political upheaval in Fiji, large numbers of Fiji Indians have migrated to Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada, taking the Fiji Hindi language with them.
