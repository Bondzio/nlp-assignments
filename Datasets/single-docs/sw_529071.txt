The fez (, plural fezzes or fezes from arabic "Fas" the main town in Marocco before 1927 ), as well as its equivalent, the tarboosh ( "ṭarbūsh"), is a felt hat.

There are two types One is a cone with a flat top, made of red felt. The other is a short cylinder made of kilim fabric. Both usually have a tassel attached to the top. The tarboosh and the modern fez, which is similar, owe much of their development and popularity to the Ottoman era.
