René de Obaldia

René de Obaldia (born 22 October 1918) is a French playwright and poet. He was elected to the Académie française on 24 June 1999. He began his career in 1960. His first major play, "Génousie," was presented at the Théâtre national populaire. 

This was followed by "Le Satyre de la Villette", with André Barsacq at the Théâtre de l'Atelier, a comedy which ranked him with his literary forebears Jacques Audiberti, Ionesco, Beckett. He has been, for more than fifty years, one of the most-produced French playwrights on the planet, as well as the most internationally renowned (having been translated into 28 languages).

In 1985 he was awarded the Grand Prix du Théâtre de l’Académie Française.
