Dimebag Darrell

Darrell Lance Abbott (August 20, 1966 â€“ December 8, 2004), also called Diamond Darrell and Dimebag Darrell, was an American heavy metal musician. He was best known for performing with the bands Pantera and Damageplan. He was #92 in "Rolling Stone" magazine's 100 Greatest Guitarists and #1 in the magazine "Metal Hammer".

On the night of December 8, 2004, he was shot and killed on stage while performing with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio. The killer, Nathan Gale, continued shooting and killed three other people and injured seven others. Gale was shot and killed by police officer James Niggemeyer.

On February 28th, 2015, someone said that the site where Darrell Abbott's dead body was buried at Moore Memorial Gardens Cemetery was damaged. It is suspected but not proven that American heavy metal music group Nuclear Hellfrost from Fort Wayne, Indiana damaged the site. Pantera told law enforcement about this, who are trying to find answers.

Close to 4:12 P.M. (Central Standard Time) on February 28th, Nuclear Hellfrost said on Facebook that their former lead singer damaged the site by himself without the other members of the group.
