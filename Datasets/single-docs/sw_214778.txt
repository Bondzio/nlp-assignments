Wat Phra-sri Rattana Mahathat

Wat Phra-sri Rattana Mahathat or Wat Yai is the most important monastery of Phitsanulok. It was built in the reign of Phra Maha Thamma Racha I in 1357 BCE. In the temple, there is a Buddha image called Phra Buddha Chinnaraj. The pearl inlaid wooden doors of the temple were built by King Borommakot in 1756 as tribute to Phra Buddha Chinnaraj. Behind the temple, there is a large pagoda high with a staircase leading up to the niche containing the Buddha relics. In front of the pagoda, there is Phra Attharos, a standing Buddha image.
