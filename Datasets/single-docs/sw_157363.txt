Yvrac

Yvrac is a commune. It is found in the region Aquitaine in the Gironde department in the southwest of France.

In 2012 a large 18th century chateau near the commune was demolished by mistake. Builders were supposed to remove another small building and then begin work on restoring the chateau. The owner, a Russian businessman, has said he will have the house rebuilt.
