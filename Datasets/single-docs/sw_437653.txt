Brad Maddox

Tyler Kluttz (born May 4, 1984 in Tega Cay, South Carolina) is an American professional wrestler, authority figure and referee. He is currently working for the WWE under the ring name Brad Maddox. He acts as the General Manager of "Raw".

On the August 20, 2012 episode of "Raw", Kluttz debuted on the main roster and refereed a Divas battle royal. At Hell in a Cell, he refereed the main event between CM Punk and Ryback for the WWE Championship. Maddox turned heel for the first time when he gave Ryback a low blow and then fast-counted a pin for Punk which helped Punk retain his title.

On the July 8 episode of "Raw", Vickie Guerrero was fired when the fans voted that she had failed in her role of Raw Managing Supervisor. Maddox was then named as the new General Manager of Raw.
