Anu

In Sumerian mythology, Anu (also An) was a sky-god. He was the god of heaven, lord of constellations, and king of the gods, spirits and demons. He lived in the highest heavenly regions. People believed that he could judge people who had committed crimes. His attendant and minister of state was the god Ilabrat.

He was one of the oldest gods in the Sumerian religion. He was a part of a triad with Enlil (god of the air) and Enki (god of water). He was called Anu by the Akkadians in Babylonian culture.
