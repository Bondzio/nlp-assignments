Sun of May

The Sun of May ("el sol de mayo") is a national emblem of Argentina and Uruguay. It is a reference to the May revolution in Argentina, which led to that country's later independence from Spain. In Uruguay it also refers to the May revolution. On 25 May 1810, the sun came out in Buenos Aires during a public gathering. This was seen as a good omen for the future success of the independence struggle.
