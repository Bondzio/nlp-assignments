Oxygen difluoride

Oxygen difluoride is the chemical compound with the formula OF. It has a V-shaped molecular structure like HO, but has different properties. It is a strong oxidizer.

Oxygen difluoride was first prepared in 1929. It was made by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid. The chemicals had small amount of moisture. Nowadays, it is prepared by the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Sodium fluoride is left as a side-product:

It is a very powerful oxidizing agent. This is proved by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom. This oxidising number is quite unusual. Above 200 Â°C, OF decomposes to oxygen and fluorine.

OF reacts with many metals. It produces oxides and fluorides. Nonmetals also react with it. Phosphorus reacts with OF to form PF and POF. Sulfur produces SO and SF with it. A noble gas, xenon also reacts with it. It produces XeF and xenon oxyfluorides.

Oxygen difluoride reacts very slowly with water to form hydrofluoric acid:

Oxygen difluoride oxidizes sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide:
However, in the presence of UV radiation the products are sulfuryl fluoride, , and pyrosulfuryl fluoride, :

OF is a dangerous chemical. This is because it is highly oxidising.
