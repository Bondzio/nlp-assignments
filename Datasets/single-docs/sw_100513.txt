Decision-making

Decision making is the mental process that leads to the selection of an action among several alternatives. Every decision making process produces a final choice. The output can be an action or an opinion.

There is a growing awareness that people often make good decisions rapidly without knowing how they do it. This runs against the older rational decision-making ideas.
