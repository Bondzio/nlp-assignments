Tyrant flycatcher

The tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are a clade of passerine birds from North and South America. They are the largest family of birds on Earth, with more than 400 species. They are the most diverse family of birds in every country in the Americas, except for the United States and Canada. The family is named after the Old World flycatchers. Some members have similar features to the Old World flycatchers, but they are not related to them. They are members of suborder Tyranni, which do not have the vocal capabilities of most other songbirds.
