Norma (constellation)

The constellation Norma is a small group of stars in the southern hemisphere between Scorpius and Centaurus. Its name is Latin for normal and can mean a right angle. The constellation may be pictured as a ruler, a carpenter's square, a set square, or a level.
The Milky Way passes through Norma.
Because it is on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep sky objects. Galaxy NGC 6087 is a highly visible one.

Shapley 1 is a planetary nebula about 1,000 lightyears away from Earth.
