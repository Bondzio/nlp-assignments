Sam Simon

Sam Simon (June 6, 1955 - March 8, 2015) was an American television producer and writer, most notable as one of the original developers of "The Simpsons", along with Matt Groening and James L. Brooks. He is perhaps best known for his creation of many "Simpsons" characters.

In late 2012, Simon was diagnosed with terminal colorectal cancer which later metastasized in his other organs, including his liver and kidneys. Simon died in his Los Angeles home from complications from the disease on March 8, 2015.
