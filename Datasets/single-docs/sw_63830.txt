Disappearance of Madeleine McCann

Madeleine McCann (born 13 May 2003 in Leicestershire, England) disappeared on the evening of Thursday, 3 May 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve, Portugal. She was staying with her parents, brother and sister.

There was a lot of news coverage around the world about the case. Rumours that Madeleine has been taken to countries such as Morocco and Malta have all turned out to be untrue.

Madeleine's parents have started a website in their daughter's name where people can keep up to date on events and write to the family. They have also started "Madeleine's Fund" to which people can give money.

Robert Murat was the first official suspect. On 8 September 2007, Madeleine's mother, Kate McCann, and her father, Gerry McCann, were declared official suspects as well, after the finding of blood and fluids in their apartment. Murat stopped being an official suspect in July 2008, Kate and Gerry in August 2008.

The case remains unsolved.
