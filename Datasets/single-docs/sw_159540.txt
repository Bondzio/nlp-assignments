Second-class citizen

Second-class citizen is a term used to describe a person who is discriminated against, even though they are a citizen or legal resident where they live. Such a person might not be a slave, an outlaw or a criminal, but they have limited rights or opportunities, and they tend to be mistreated or neglected by the majority of citizens.

Second-class citizenry is usually seen as a violation of human rights. African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way.
