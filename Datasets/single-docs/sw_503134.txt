Maltese (dog)

The Maltese is a small dog that originated around the Mediterranean. Phoenician traders may have brought precursors of this dog from Ancient Egypt. The tomb of Ramesses II contains statues of dogs, which resemble the Maltese. The name of the dog may be due to the island Mljet, near Dubrovnik. Maltese dogs are small, up to about in length, and in weight.
