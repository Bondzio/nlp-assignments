Váli (son of Odin)

In Norse mythology, Váli is a son of the god Odin and the giantess Rindr. He was birthed for the sole purpose of killing Höðr as revenge for Höðr's accidental murder of his twin brother, Baldur. He grew to full adulthood within one day of his birth, and slaughtered him with no regret, no heart, and no thought.

He is also the god of flight. Anything that passes through the sky, whether man made or of nature is under his control. To symbolize this his cloak is made of raven feathers that when he spreads his arms looks like wings. Váli is fated to survive Ragnarök.
