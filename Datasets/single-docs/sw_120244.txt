Klaus Barbie

Klaus Barbie (25 October 1913 – 25 September 1991) was an SS-"Hauptsturmführer", soldier, and Gestapo member. He is known as the "Butcher of Lyon" because of the war crimes he committed in France during World War II. He lived in Bolivia from 1951 until he was extradited (moved by government order) to France in 1983. From 1984-1987, he was tried and convicted of, and sentenced to life imprisonment for, crimes against humanity. He remained in prison until he died of leukemia in Lyon.
