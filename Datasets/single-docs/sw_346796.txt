Ash-throated antwren

The ash-throated antwren ("Herpsilochmus parkeri") is a bird in the antbird family. The first species was found in northern Peru in 1983.

Antbirds do anting. The bird rubs ants (or other arthropods) on the feathers before discarded or eating them. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites
