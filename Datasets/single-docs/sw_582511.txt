House of Alpin

The House of Alpin, sometimes referred to as the Alpínid dynasty, Clann Chináeda, and Clann Chinaeda meic Ailpín was the house given to the kings of Scotland, titled as "King of the Picts" from the reign of Kenneth MacAlpin I in 843/848 until the death of Malcolm II in 1034. Although some sources claim that the house lasted until the death of Lulach in 1058.


"The reign of Aed is disputed and many sources list the next monarch after Constantine I as Giric."











The house is considered by most to end with the death of Malcolm II in 1034 but some lists state the house lasted until Lulach, this is the extended house including the rest of 1034-1058's monarchs.
