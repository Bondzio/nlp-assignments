Steam turbine

A steam turbine is a machine that gets thermal energy from pressurised steam. It uses the energy to do mechanical work by rotation. It is usually connected to a generator to produce electricity.

There are many sizes of steam turbines, from small ones (less than 0.75 kW) for pumps and other devices, to larger ones (1,500,000 kW) for producing electricity.
