Basis (linear algebra)

In linear algebra, a basis is a set of vectors in a given vector space with certain properties:


The Dimension of a given vector space is the number of elements of the basis.

If formula_1 is the vector space then :

Bformula_2{formula_3} is a basis of formula_1

It's easy to see that for any element of formula_1 it can be represented as a combination of the above basis.
Let formula_6 be any element of formula_1, lets say formula_8

Since formula_9 and formula_10 are elements of formula_11 then they can be written as formula_12 and so on.

Then the combination equals the element formula_6

This shows that the set B is a basis of formula_1
