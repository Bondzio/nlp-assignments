40th G7 summit

The 40th G8 summit was held in Brussels on June 4–5, 2014. It was originally going to be held at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia.

After Russia's involvement in the 2014 Crimean crisis, some people wanted Russia to leave the G8. On March 24, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron said that the meeting would not occur in Russia due to the Crimean crisis. The other seven countries decided to hold it without Russia.

The participants will be the "core members" of the group:

A number of national leaders are traditionally invited to attend the summit.

On June 4, 2014 on G7 meeting in Brussels leaders of the G7 nations in their joint statement condemned Moscow for its «continuing violation» of Ukraine's sovereignty and say they are prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.

The G7 summit on June 4–5, 2014 is the first since Russia was expelled from the group following its annexation of Crimea in March.

Planning for the summit has to anticipate protest groups and other activists.

For some, the G8 summit will be a profit-generating event; as for example, the "G8 Summit" magazines which have been published since 1998.
