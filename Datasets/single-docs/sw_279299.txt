Charles Edward Stuart

Charles Edward Stuart (Prince Charles Edward Louis Philip Casimir Stuart, 31 December 1720 - 31 January 1788) is better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or as 'The Young Pretender'.

Bonnie Prince Charlie was the Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This claim was as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, and grandson of James II and VII.

Charles is perhaps best known as the leading the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745. He led a rebellion which ended in a heavy defeat at the Battle of Culloden. That ended the Jacobite cause. Charles's escape from Scotland after the uprising made him a romantic figure of heroic failure. The "Skye Boat Song" remembers him.

He lived, and died, in Rome, where his father had been given a home by Clement XI.
