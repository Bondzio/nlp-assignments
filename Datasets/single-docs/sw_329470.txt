LGBT rights in the Maldives

Homosexuality is illegal in the Maldives. In addition, the Maldives was one of the 67 signatory nations opposing the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, which failed to pass.

The Maldives does not recognize same-sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships.

There is no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
