Office suite

In computing, an office suite, sometimes called an office software suite or productivity suite is a software suite for use by workers. The parts of an office suite are usually come together, have a standard user interface and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways operating systems would not normally allow.

There are three types of office suites, "offline" (e.g. Microsoft Office and Star Office), "hybrid" (e.g. Microsoft Office Live and Google Docs with Gears) and purely "online" (e.g. Thinkfree Office and Zoho Office Suite).


The most used office suite is Microsoft Office, which is available for Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh. It has become a proprietary standard in office Software.

Another office suite is any of the OpenDocument suites, which use the free OpenDocument file format. The most used one was OpenOffice.org , open-source software that can be used in Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and has created several other office suites similar to it, such as the Mac-native NeoOffice. Other free or less expensive office suites include LibreOffice, StarOffice, SSuite Office, KOffice and Celframe Office. These programs support many of the features of Microsoft Office, and can open the files it creates and save new documents in those formats.

Apple computers have iWork, which is a office suite created specially for Mac OS X. It includes Pages, for word-processing, Numbers for spreadsheets, and Keynote, for presentations. They can also use Microsoft Office for Mac, or StarOffice, KOffice, NeoOffice and OpenOffice.org, which all can be used on Apple computers.
