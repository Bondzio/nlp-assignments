Seamus Heaney

Seamus Heaney (1939-2013) won a Nobel Prize in 1995 for poetry. He lived in Dublin for much of his life.

Heaney was born on 13 April 1939 at the family farmhouse called Mossbawn, in Northern Ireland. His parents were Patrick and Sarah Heaney, and Seamus was the first of nine children. 
Patrick was a farmer, but his main business was selling cattle. 

Sarah Heaney was called Sarah McCann before she married Patrick Heaney, and her relations worked to make cloth in the linen industry. 
Heaney said it was important part of his background that his parents came from different parts of Irish life: the cattle-herding Gaelic past and the Ulster of the Industrial Revolution.

Heaney died in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin, aged 74, following a stroke.
