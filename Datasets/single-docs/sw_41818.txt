Jackson's Chameleon

Jackson's Chameleons are a species of chameleon found in the forests of Kenya and Tanzania. They have been introduced to the United States with large populations being found in Hawaii. They live and breed naturally there now. 

Males are easily recognized, they have two horns above their eyes and one horn on their nose. If males are kept together in a cage, they get stressed, and eventually die. But they have been know to live together, it all depends on the chams themselves.

Females do not have horns, or if they do they are very small. Their biggest size is 15 inches. This species gives birth to live young with a gestation period of about 5-10 months.
