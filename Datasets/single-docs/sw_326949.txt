Sleeping Beauty (1959 movie)

Sleeping Beauty (1959) is an American animated movie produced by Walt Disney Productions and released to movie theaters by Buena Vista Distribution. It is based on the 1697 fairy tale "The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood" by Charles Perrault. The movie was directed by Les Clark, Eric Larson, and Wolfgang Reitherman, under the supervision of Clyde Geronimi. Additional story work was provided by Joe Rinaldi, Winston Hibler, Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ralph Wright, and Milt Banta. 

The movie's musical score and songs are arrangements or adaptations of material from the 1890 "Sleeping Beauty" ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Buena Vista Distribution released the movie to theaters on November 11, 1959. It was the first animated movie to be photographed in the Technirama widescreen process. The movie was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements. 

The movie generated mixed reviews from critics. They thought the movie was slow-paced and lacked character development. "Sleeping Beauty" earned approximately $7.7 million in box office rentals. Its production costs totaled $6 million, making it the most expensive Disney movie to that date. The high production costs of the movie resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and many animators were laid off.
