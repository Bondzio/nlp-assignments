Scots pine

Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) is a species of pine native to Europe and Asia. It ranges from Scotland, Ireland and Portugal in the west, east to eastern Siberia, south to the Caucasus Mountains, and as far north as well inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia. 

In the north of its range, it occurs from sea level to 1,000 m, while in the south of its range it is a high altitude mountain tree, growing at 1,200â€“2,600 m altitude. 

It has fairly short, blue-green leaves and orange-red bark.
