British Rail Class 325

The British Rail Class 325 is a dual-voltage alternating current (AC) electric multiple unit (EMU) train used for postal train services. Their cabs look similar to the Class 365 and Class 465 "Networker" units built around the same time. The Class 325 was British Rail's newest unit to take over parcels working on electrified lines.
