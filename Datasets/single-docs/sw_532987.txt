Conosa

The Conosa is one of three subphyla in the Amoebozoa. It is subdivided into two infraphyla â€“ the Mycetozoa and the Archamoebae.

Conosa includes the species "Dictyostelium discoideum" and "Entamoeba histolytica", among others.

About 2000 species are known, and probably there are many more. Because these cells have few visible characteristics, they do look rather alike: "they exhibit few morphological traits that can be used as taxonomic characters". As their molecular biology becomes known, many species may get split.
