St. Paul's Cathedral

St. Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican church in Central London, England. It was started in 604. The man who started the building was called Mellitas. He was Bishop of the East Saxons. 

In 962 and 1087 the cathedral burnt down and was built again. Before today's version of the cathedral there were four others but they also burnt down. Today's cathedral is made of limestone and it was built after the Great Fire of London in 1666. 

Its architect was Sir Christopher Wren, who designed a further 50 churches. St Paul's is a popular tourist attraction and is still used as a church today.
