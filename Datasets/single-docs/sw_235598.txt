Wiener Werkstattpreis

The international Wiener Werkstattpreis is a literary prize in Austria and has been founded in 1992. Since the year 2000, the prize is given every year. The organizers want to promote writers who are not well-known yet.

The prize is 1,100 EUR. In 2007, the authors could send in their texts in three categories: short story, poetry and essay.

Supported and partly paid by the Austrian government and the city administration of Vienna, the prize is organized by the publishing house FZA.
