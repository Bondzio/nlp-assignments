Crash (Gwen Stefani song)

"Crash" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." (2004). Written by Stefani and No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal, the song uses car metaphors to describe a relationship. Many music critics compared the song to music made by American female rap group Salt-n-Pepa.

Unlike the previous singles released from the "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." album, "Crash" was the only song not to feature an actual music video, a live performance from the "Harajuku Lovers Tour" was used instead, this was mainly because Stefani was pregnant with her first child.
