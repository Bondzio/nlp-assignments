Bursitis

Bursitis is a painful condition. Small sacs called bursae get inflamed. Bursae are pockets between your muscles and your bones. Your bursa help you move without pain. In bursitis, the inflammation is often caused by extra fluid in the bursae. The most common places to have bursitis are in your hip and shoulder. You can also have bursitis in your elbow, knee and toe.

One of the most common symptoms of bursitis is pain. It can also cause stiffness and swelling. Pain happens when you move your joints.

The most common cause of bursitis is moving your joints too much. Swelling can happen when the joint locks.

There are a few ways to treat bursitis. The best way to treat bursitis is to rest the joint and to lift it up. You can also put a medicine called cortisone into the hurt bursa. You should put it on ice for twenty minutes three to four times a day.
