Oppositional defiant disorder

Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder. It is a pattern of irritable or angry behavior lasting at least 6 months and is seen during interaction with other people. Unlike those with conduct disorder, though, most people with ODD do not usually get aggressive towards other people or animals, steal or cause destruction. People with ODD, however, do argue and deliberately, often cause trouble.

In order to be diagnosed with ODD, the person must have a behavior pattern lasting at least six months. At least four of these eight symptoms must be present for that time:


About 10.2% of people have or have had ODD (11.2% of males and 9.2% of females). In many cases this condition worsens into conduct disorder, which often worsens into antisocial personality disorder. This is more likely in boys than girls, and more likely if the person also has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. ODD typically begins in childhood. It is the most common mental disorder in children. It is unusual in adults, because the affected person usually either recovers or develops ASPD. 

ODD is more common in family members of people who have ODD, CD or ASPD. It is more common in poor urban areas. 

Most people who have ODD also have other mental disorders, most often ADHD. Many children who have ODD have problems with alcohol and drugs in their adolescence and adulthood.
