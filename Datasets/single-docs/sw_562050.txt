New York City Hall

New York City Hall is located at the center of City Hall Park in the Civic Center area of Lower Manhattan. The building is the oldest city hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions. It has the office of the Mayor of New York City and the chambers of the New York City Council. While the Mayor's Office is in the building, the staff of thirteen municipal agencies under mayoral control are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building.

It was built from 1810 to 1812. The New York City Hall is a National Historic Landmark. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Both the outside (1966) and the inside of the building (1976) are designated New York City landmarks.
