List of Toronto subway and RT stations

This is a list of all current stations of the Toronto Transit Commission's subway/RT system.

 Shows the station is wheelchair accessible.
The listed services are in parts of the station you need to have paid to be in.

Also, the streetcar system has a single underground station with no subway connections: Queens Quay. It opened in 1990 and is wheelchair accessible, though the streetcars that service the station are not. Exhibition Loop can also have station-like status during major events; at such times ticketing booths are used at its entrance, and thus its fence-enclosed streetcar platform becomes a fare-paid area.

Interac, American Express, MasterCard, Visa tell what method of payment of Metropass purchases only at Collection Booths. Tickets and tokens are cash only.
Most of the other services have signs displayed on their doors for payment methods.
