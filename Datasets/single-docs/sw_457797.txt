Max Horkheimer

Max Horkheimer (February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German-American philosopher and sociologist. He was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. 

His most important works include "The Eclipse of Reason" (1947), "Between Philosophy and Social Science" (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, "The Dialectic of Enlightenment" (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.

After Hitler had become Chancellor of Germany, Horkheimer, who was of Jewish descent, migrated via Switzerland to the United States.

His collected works have been issued in German as "Gesammelte Schriften", 19 volumes, edited by Alfred Schmidt and Gunzelin Schmid Noerr. S. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 1985-1996.
