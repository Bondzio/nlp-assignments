Choanoflagellate

The choanoflagellates are a class or phylum of collared microscopic flagellate eukaryotes. Some species are single cells, some are multicellular. They do not have chloroplasts, and are heterotrophic. Some consider they form the simplest phylum of animals; others consider them to be protists.
