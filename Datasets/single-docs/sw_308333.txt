Metabolic syndrome

Metabolic syndrome is a combination of several medical issues. They increase the risk for heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Twenty five percent of people of the United States have metabolic syndrome. 

The term "metabolic syndrome" dates back to at least the late 1950s, but came into common usage in the late 1970s to describe various associations of risk factors with diabetes mellitus that had been noted as early as the 1920s.
