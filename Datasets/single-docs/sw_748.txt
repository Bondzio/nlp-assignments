Scientist

A scientist is a person who studies or has expertise in science. A scientist tries to understand how our world, or other things, work. Scientists make observations, ask questions and do extensive research work in finding the answers to many questions others may not know about.

Scientists may work in laboratories for governments, companies, schools and research institutes. Some scientists teach at universities and other places and train people to become scientists. Scientists often make experiments to find out more about reality, and sometimes may repeat experiments or use control groups. Scientists who are doing applied science try to use scientific knowledge to improve the world.

Scientists can work in different areas of science.
