Samsung Galaxy

Samsung Galaxy is a series of mobile devices made by Samsung. Most of them are smartphones and tablet computers that run Android, an operating system made by Google. New models come out every year.

The first Samsung Galaxy phone came out in June 2009. There are many different models of phones. Each of them are different, such as in the size of their screens or what features it has, but the best of them is the Galaxy S series. The most recent Galaxy S phone is the Samsung Galaxy S8, which was announced in March 2017. Of the other Galaxy phones, the Galaxy Note series have a bigger screen and a stylus pen. The most recent of these, the Galaxy Note 7, is no longer being sold because of batteries that catch fire and blow up.

The first Samsung Galaxy tablet came out in September 2010. The most recent is the Galaxy Tab S3, which was announced in February 2017. Like the phones, there are different models of Galaxy tablets, which can have screen sizes from 7 inches all the way up to 12 inches. Some models have keyboards that plug into the device to make it easier to type, while others have a stylus, like the Galaxy Note phones. Also, although most of the Galaxy tablets use Android, some of the newer ones, such as the Galaxy TabPro S, use Windows 10 instead.

Samsung also made smartwatches under the Galaxy brand. The first of these was the Galaxy Gear, which came out in September 2013. The company has since made some new models, including the Galaxy Gear Live in June 2014, but later ones are branded as Samsung Gear.

Besides their own products, Samsung also made the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus phones, and the Nexus 10 tablet. These are all part of Google's own Nexus series of phones. Unlike Samsung's own phones, they have no extra mobile apps added or changes made to the user interface.
