Orson Welles

George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 â€“ October 10, 1985) was an American director of movies and the theatre, as well as an actor, screenwriter, broadcaster and producer.

Welles was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

In 1938, he performed "The War of the Worlds" (about an attack on Earth by beings from the planet Mars) on the radio. It was a radio drama (fiction), but many people took it as a newscast.

Welles also made the movie "Citizen Kane" in 1941. Many movie critics think that this movie is the best movie ever made.

Welles died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, aged 70.
