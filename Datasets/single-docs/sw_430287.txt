Buster Edwards

Ronald Christopher Edwards (27 January 1931 â€“ 28 November 1994), known as Buster Edwards, was a British career criminal. He was born in Lambeth, London. He was a member of the gang of the Great Train Robbery. He had also been a boxer and nightclub owner. Edwards was in prison for nine years.

Edwards died after hanging himself (suicide) in Lambeth, at the age of 63. His cause of death is still disputed because many people thought he was too drunk to have chosen to kill himself.

A biopic, "Buster", was released in 1988.
