Kenneth Hood "Buddy" MacKay, Jr. (born March 22, 1933) is an American politician and diplomat. He served as Governor of Florida, following the death of then-Governor Lawton Chiles. He served as Governor for less than a month. He is the last Democrat to serve as Governor of Florida.

Controlling the national budget one of his main concerns. In 1988 he received the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, but lost in a very close race for that office to Connie Mack III.

MacKay won the 1990 Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor on the ticket headed by former Senator Lawton Chiles. They won the election and were re-elected in 1994. MacKay succeeded Chiles as governor after his sudden death in 1998.

A few months later, he became governor after Chiles' death. MacKay served as governor for 23 days. During his term as governor, MacKay granted six pardons to female prisoners and tried to fix the Everglades. He appointed Peggy Quince for Florida Supreme Court.
