Men on the National Convention would be on the National Convention for a year, followed by another election. The National convention became known as the most radical part of the French Revolution. It took land away from the Nobility and sold it to peasants. It sent thousands of people to the guillotine for execution. in 1793 they voted to execute Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette.
