Parable of the Faithful Servant

The Parable of the Faithful Servant (or Parable of the Door Keeper) is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:42-51, Mark 13:34-37, and Luke 12:35-48. 

The parable:

The parable immediately precedes the Parable of the Ten Virgins in the Matthew 25. It means "be prepared and remain alert." The exact time of Jesus' Second Coming is unknown. 

The bridegroom is Jesus Christ. The wedding banquet is his wedding banquet. The advice is for the church, his bride, while she waits for him. He has chosen her. "That privilege brings responsibility and that responsibility entails accountability." Priests will be judged more severely than pagans who never heard of Jesus.
