Ballista

The ballista (plural ballistae) was one of the first artillery weapons used by the Ancient Greeks. The ballista was invented around 400 BC in a Greek town called Syracuse. It was one of the first catapults, and shot very large and heavy spears far distances. 
The ballista also resembled a large crossbow and could be used throw scaled-up arrows and darts as well.
The steps to operating the ballista are:
1.Pulling back the bow-string with a winch, which creates tension.
2.Loading the ballista with a light missile e.g. darts with iron points.
3.Releasing the bow-string, which launched the missile.
Ballistae would be used if a weapon that fired light, narrow ammunition was needed.
