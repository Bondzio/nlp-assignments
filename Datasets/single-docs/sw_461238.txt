Shogun was the fourth studio album by the heavy metal band Trivium. The album released on September 23 2008 through Roadrunner Records. Work on the album started in October 2007, when the band wanted to try new things with their music. 

The album got very good reviews from many different websites. About.com gave the album four stars saying that "Shogun won't silence Trivium's legions of critics, but I think most fans will like the harsh vocals along with the great riffs and memorable melodies."

Thompson said it was Trivium's best album to date.
