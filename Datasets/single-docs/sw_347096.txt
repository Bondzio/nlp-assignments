Kemmu

In 1333-1336, the Kemmu Restoration was an attempt by Emperor Go-Daigo to restore Imperial authority after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate. The failure of this effort led to the creation of two rival Imperial courts.

The previous era ended and the new one commenced in "Shōkei" 1 as time was reckoned in the Northern Court in Kyoto; and the era began in "Genkō" 4, as time was ordered in the Southern Court in Yoshino.
