Speed limit

A speed limit is a legal limit on how fast a road vehicle can be driven. Some roads also have a minimum speed limit, which is how slow a vehicle is allowed to travel.

In the United Kingdom, the speed limit in towns is usually 30 miles per hour, and the speed limit on dual carriageways and motorways is usually 70 miles per hour. In France, the speed limit on motorways is usually 130 kilometres per hour, which is about 80 miles per hour. Also, in United States, most highways are from 65 to 70 miles per hour, and freeways are from 55 to 80 miles per hour. In Canada, the speed limit is usually about 100 km/h. In Australia the speed limit on freeways is between 100 and 120 kilometres per hour, and in towns and cities between 40 and 60 km/h.
