Dawlish Warren

Dawlish Warren is a small seaside resort. It is near Dawlish on the south coast of Devon, England. It is at the mouth of the Exe Estuary, and has a beach, a National Nature Reserve spanning 505 acres (2 km²) and a golf course. There is also one of Europe's largest spits in Dawlish Warren measuring over 1.5miles long and 0.5miles wide. There is a fence running down the centre of the spit to prevent people from wandering and falling into any deep parts of the salt marshes that have accumulated on the inside of the spit.
