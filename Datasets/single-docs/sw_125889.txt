Dhund Abbasi

The Dhund Abbasi (also written "Dh√∫nd"; ) is a tribe in northern Pakistan. They are mainly settled in Abbottabad District and the Murree Hills. The tribe speaks the "Dhundi-Kairlali" hill dialect of Pahari. Apart from Abbottabad and Murree, there are large populations of Abbasis living in the Rawalpindi District of Punjab and the Bagh District of Azad Kashmir.

There is a lot of speculation who the Dhunds are and where they really came from.

There has been no DNA testing of the Dhund. According to another story, they came much later, when Muhammad Ghori asked for help from the Abbasid caliphate. According to this spurious version of the story, they are either Arab soldiers of the Abbasid forces, or even distant relations of the Abbasids.

As per confirmed Y-DNA research at they do not share the same ancestry as their neighbors, the Tanoli. It is believed that this branch of Arabian nd their ancestor came to India with Timur. A descendant of this ancestor went to Kahuta during the reign of Shah Jahan. His sons were the ancestors of the Abbasi, the Tanoli, and several other modern tribes.

British and most later scholars have said that these stories are probably not true. They instead claim that all of these tribes are of local, indigenous Hindu origin. They have said that the Dhund are closely related to the Karlal tribe also living nearby. In the censuses of 1881, 1891 and 1901, many of the Dhund identified as either "Dhund" or "Rajputs". Rose and others (1911) wrote that the Dhund tribespeople in Hazara claimed descent from Rajput chieftains and continued to practise Hindu customs. However, Donnan wrote that this was an unusual claim and that it was generally accepted that the Dhund had converted to Islam from Hinduism.
