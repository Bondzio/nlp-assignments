Supply depot

A Supply depot is a type of military installation used to store military supplies. They are usually near the front lines so they can provide supplies to their military units. Supply depots store and distribute the equipment and supplies a military needs to operate. These are often kept in buildings called warehouses. Modern supply depots do not typically store ammunition. Because of the dangers of storing live ammunition and explosives they are kept separate in an ammunition dump. Supply depots are usually run by a logistics officer. He or she is responsible for getting supplies to units who need them when they need them. Supply depots are often the targets of enemy raids. By destroying an enemy's supplies, it hurts their ability to fight.
