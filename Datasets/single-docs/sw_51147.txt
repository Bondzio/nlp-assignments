Giovanni Boccaccio

Giovanni Boccaccio (June 16, 1313 - December 21, 1375) was an Italian author and poet. He wrote several famous works, such as "On Famous Women" and the "Decameron". Boccaccio was the first poet, who used ottava rima in longer poems.
Thus he started long tradition of employing this form in epic poems. 
Some of Geoffrey Chaucer's works were based on Boccaccio's poems.
