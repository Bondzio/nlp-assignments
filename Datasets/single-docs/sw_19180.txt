Equatorial Guinea

The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is a nation in west central Africa, and one of the smallest countries in Africa. It borders Cameroon on the north, Gabon on the south and east, and the Gulf of Guinea on the west. In the past, it was the Spanish colony of Spanish Guinea. The country's territory is both on the continent and on islands. The continental part is known as RÃ­o Muni. On one island, Bioko, is the capital, Malabo.

Equatorial Guinea is the only country in Africa where Spanish is an official language.

Equatorial Guinea is divided into seven provinces (capitals appear in parentheses):


The provinces are further divided into districts.
