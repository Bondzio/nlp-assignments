Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery

Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, KG, PC (7 May 1847â€“21 May 1929) was a British Liberal statesman and Prime Minister.

As a Scottish peer he did not automatically have a seat in the House of Lords, so he was made Baron Roseberry in 1868, and the Earl of Midlothian in 1911.
