The Craig Machine

The Craig Machine is a live album by comedian Stephen Lynch that was released on October 4, 2005 by What Are Records?. The CD was recorded live at Symphony Space in New York City on May 9 and 16, 2005. "The Craig Machine" debuted at #2 on "Billboard" Magazine's Comedy Charts.

The title is taken from a lyric from the fifth track on the album, which is from the point of view of Jesus Christ's pretend brother, Craig. The quoted lyric asks of the listener "not 'What Would Jesus Do?' but 'Where will you be when the Craig Machine comes partyin' through?'"
