Dési Bouterse

Desiré Delano "Dési" Bouterse (born 13 October 1945) is a Surinamese politician who has been President of Suriname since 2010. From 1980 to 1987 he was Suriname's "de facto" leader when the country was under military rule.

On February 25, 1980, the government of Suriname underwent a military coup led by Bouterse. Though the Suriname Presidency was retained, Bouterse was the nation's ruler until his resignation in 1988.

Bouterse is held responsible for the numerous human rights violations committed under his dictatorship, such as the murder of 15 people known as the December murders, and the massacre in the village Moiwana.

On July 19, 2010, he was elected as President of Suriname with 36 of 50 parliament votes.
