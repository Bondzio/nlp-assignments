Presbyterianism

Presbyterianism is a kind of Protestant Christianity. It is very conservative when compared to other kinds of Christianity. It was started off in Scotland by John Knox and became powerful in England during the Civil War. Today there are Presbyterian churches across the world.

Presbyterians (followers of Presbyterianism) believe that the Bible is the most important thing in their church because it was given to humans by God and has no errors in it. They believe that God has control over everything and has chosen to make some people to follow Jesus Christ but not others, and that only followers of Jesus may get into heaven. (See Calvinism)

Presbyterian churches may be led by men called Ministers, Rectors or Elders. Some Presbyterian churches have women as elders.

There is no overall leader and there are no bishops in the Presbyterian tradition. On Sunday the Bible, which they consider the 'Word of God', is read and a sermon preached by the minister is at the heart of a morning worship service, which also includes group singings of some worship songs.

The Korea Presbyterian Church was started through the mission of the Presbyterian Church (USA). After Korean independence, the division was formed afresh as 'Presbyterian Church in Korea (KoRyuPa)' advocating the views of Dutch Reformed churches. In 2012 a new General Assembly of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church of Korea declared authentic historical succession of John Knox.
