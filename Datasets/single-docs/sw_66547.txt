Decimal separator

The decimal separator is a symbol used to mark the border between the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal numeral. This symbol can be a period or a comma. Decimal point and decimal comma are common names for the decimal separator. For example 9.5 means nine and one half in English speaking countries.
