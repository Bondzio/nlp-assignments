London Heliport

London Heliport at Battersea, London is the capital's main and busiest heliport. 

It is on the south bank of the River Thames, 3 nautical miles (3.5 miles or 5.6 km) southwest of Westminster Bridge and the Palace of Westminster. It is on a jetty between Wandsworth Bridge and Battersea Railway Bridge. The nearest railway station is Clapham Junction, and the nearest tube station is Fulham Broadway.

The heliport, once owned by Westland and then Harrods, is a very small site. It uses a concrete surface on a jetty as a helipad for take-off and landing. There is onshore parking for between three and four aircraft, usually just the smaller helicopters. The heliport has landing, parking and refuelling services between 08:00 and 21:00. Flights are permitted between 07:00 and 23:00.
