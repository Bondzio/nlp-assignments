Jane Jacobs

Jane Jacobs (May 4, 1916 â€“ April 25, 2006) was a Canadian and American journalist, author and activist. She had an influence on urban studies. Her book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" said that urban renewal did not respect the needs of most city people. 

Jacobs was well known for making grassroots efforts to protect existing neighborhoods from "slum clearance". In 1968, she was arrested for inciting a crowd on the cancellation of Lower Manhattan Expressway. Also in 1968, she moved to Toronto. In Toronto, she criticized the building of the Spadina Expressway (now Allen Road). 

Jacobs got the second Vincent Scully prize from the National Building Museum in 2000.

Jacobs was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. She died from a stroke in Toronto at age 89.
