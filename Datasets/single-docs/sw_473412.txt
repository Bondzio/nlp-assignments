Flying University

Flying University (or "Floating University") was a counterculture educational activist group in Warsaw, Poland. They gathered in private apartments to teach history and the Polish language to students. The group operated for 20 years from 1885 to 1905. Warsaw was then under the control of the Russian Empire. Marie Curie became a student here after being banned from Warsaw University because of her sex.
