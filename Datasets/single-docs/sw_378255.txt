Semmyō calendar

, also known as "Semmei-reki" or "Xuanming li", was a Japanese lunisolar calendar ("genka reki"). It was used from the late-9th century to the late-17th century.

The "Semmyō-reki" or "Semmei-reki" system corrected errors in earlier calendars which were developed in China. It was the work of Shibukawa Shunkai and Shikokawa Kōkyō.

The earliest record of this calendar is in the 8th month of the 3rd year of "Jōgan" (861) during the reign of the Emperor Seiwa.
