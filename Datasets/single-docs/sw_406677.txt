Big Brother Canada

Big Brother is a Canadian reality television show. The show follows a group of people known as "HouseGuests". They are not allowed to contact anyone from outside the "Big Brother" house. They are under constant surveillance of cameras and microphones. They live in the house for a chance to win $100,000. Each week the HouseGuests will vote to evict one of the two nominees from the house until two remain. The winner is decided by the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the "Big Brother" Jury.

The show is based on the original Dutch language show "Big Brother", which was created in 1997 by John de Mol. The Canadian show is produced by Endemol USA and Insight Productions. Insight Productions had produced other Canadian versions of the popular television shows, "Canadian Idol" and "Canada's Got Talent".

During the final vote Topaz Brady voted for Jillian McLaughlin instead of Gary Levy. She said that she mistakenly voted for Jillian. Topaz pleaded with show producers to allow her vote be changed. However, because of the rules she was not allowed to do so. Topaz's vote for Jillian helped her win "Big Brother". Gary was runner-up and said that he is happy for Jillian.
