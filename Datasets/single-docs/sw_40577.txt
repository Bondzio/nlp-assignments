Islamophobia

Islamophobia is a political term meant as an insult that literally means the fear of Muslims. It is sometimes used to describe a hatred of the religion and its followers. It may be the cause of hate crimes. "Islamophobia" can supposedly take the form of criticisms against certain ideological positions taken by believers but almost always state the religion itself as the actual problem. Islamophobia is defined by some scholars as a type of racism.

In 1996, the Runnymede Trust researched public opinions about Islam. The research showed people have different opinions about Islam. The most negative opinions that some people have about Islam are:


A study found that Muslim women experienced Islamophobic attacks (although almost all are committed by Muslim men) more often than Muslim men.

In France it is illegal for Muslim women to wear veils that cover their faces, like burkas and niqabs. Some people say that this is Islamophobic.
