Aloha shirt

An Aloha shirt (also known as a Hawaiian shirt) is a type of shirt that comes from Hawaii. It is the most popular type of clothing made in Hawaii. The shirts are usually short sleeved, have buttons and have collars. The brand was first sold in a Honolulu shop by a Japanese immigrant in 1904. After his death in 1915, his son took over the shop and continued selling them.
