Asakura, Fukuoka

Ancient artifacts and agricultural tools have been found at Asakura. These finds date to the Yayoi period and the Kofun period (300 BC-538 AD).

In 660-661, the town of Asakura was briefly the capital of Japan when Empress Saimei moved her court to "Asakura no Tachibana no Hironiwa" Palace or "Asakure no Tachibana no Hironiwa-no-miya".

In 2006, the town merged with the former city of Amagi and the town of Haki. A new city named Asakura was formed.
