Interval (music)

An interval in music means the distance between two notes (whether these notes are played together or separately).

Two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another (counting both white and black notes) are a “semitone” apart. A “tone” is two semitones (see semitone). However, an “intervale” depends on how the notes are written (what they are called) e.g. whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat (which are two different names for the same note).

Please note that in all of the examples below, C is the lower note of the pair, and the other note is the next note of that name above it. So, the interval between a C and a B is only a major 7th if it is between a C and next B above it.

In a major scale there are eight notes e.g. a C major scale (see above) is:
C D E F G A B C and down again.


If a major interval is made smaller by a semitone it becomes minor:


If a perfect interval becomes smaller by a semitone it becomes “diminished”


If a major interval becomes smaller by "two" semitones (i.e. a tone) it becomes “diminished”


If a major interval is made bigger by a semitone it becomes “augmented”


Similarly, if a perfect interval becomes bigger by a semitone it becomes “augmented”


Examples:

It is important to realize that, in order to work out what an interval is, the lower note should be treated as the first note of the scale.

Examples:

Intervals can be “inverted” (turned upside down). For example: instead of going from a C up to an A (major 6th) we can go from C down to an A (minor 3rd).



Compound intervals are intervals bigger than an octave e.g.
C to D an octave and one more note above it is a major 9th.

Big intervals are called “wide” intervals. The opposite is a “narrow” interval.
