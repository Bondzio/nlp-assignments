ISO 639-2

ISO 639 is a set of international standards that lists short codes for language names. First there was ISO 639-1. Because more languages were found, the ISO 639-2 was made.

Each language has a 3 letter code. The list below shows all the codes in ISO 639-2.

The following is a complete list of three-letter ISO 639-2 codes. Where two ISO 639-2 codes are given in the table, the one with the asterisk is the bibliographic code (B code) and the other is the terminological code (T code).
