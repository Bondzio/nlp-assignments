Durban

Durban (Zulu: "eThekwini" (IPA: ) has the second largest population of a city in South Africa. It is part of the province KwaZulu Natal. 

It is thought that the first known inhabitants of the Durban area arrived from the north around 100,000 BC, according to carbon dating of rock art found in caves in the Drakensberg. These people lived in the central plains of KwaZulu-Natal until the expansion of Bantu people from the north sometime during the last millennium.
