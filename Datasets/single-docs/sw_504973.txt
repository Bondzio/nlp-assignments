Tzatziki

Tzatziki is the Greek version of a type of dish served widely in the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is basically a cold yogurt dish with chopped-up cucumber or other vegetables. It is excellent to go with the spiced meat dishes of the Mediterranean cuisine.

A common recipe is strained yogurt (usually from sheep or goat milk) mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, sometimes lemon juice, and dill, mint, or parsley. Tzatziki is almost always served cold.
