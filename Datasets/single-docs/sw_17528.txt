Amiga CD32

The Amiga CD32 was a game console made by Commodore International. It was based on the A1200 computer. It was basically a computer without the computer's main parts. It could support other things that could make it into a computer. It had CD-rom drive and could play CD32 games. They did not make many CD32 games.

It did not do very well.
