Division of Flinders

The Division of Flinders is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. The division was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. It once covered country areas south and east of Melbourne which are now outer southern suburbs on the Mornington Peninsula, including Dromana, Hastings and Portsea.

It is named for Matthew Flinders, the first man to sail right around Australia, and the person who gave Australia her name. 

It has usually been a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party and the earlier conservative parties. It was won by the Australian Labor Party in 1929 when Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was defeated. This was the first time an Australian Prime Minister has lost his own seat at a general election. The only other time this has happened was when Liberal Prime Minister John Howard lost his seat of Bennelong in the 2007 election. 

James Faibairn was Australia's first Minister for Air; he was one of three government ministers killed in the Canberra air disaster in 1940.

Sir Phillip Lynch and Peter Reith were former Deputy Liberal leaders.

Greg Hunt was Minister for the Environment in the Abbott Government.
