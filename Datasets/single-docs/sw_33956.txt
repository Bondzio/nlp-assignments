An average or mean is a number that is typical of a group of numbers. The average of a group of numbers is often located in between, in the middle of that group of numbers. An average is found from the group of numbers by arithmetic. The most common type of average is the mean. 

In some sports, such as cricket and baseball, averages are used to tell how good a player is (such as batting average). Sporting averages have special rules for how to calculate them.
