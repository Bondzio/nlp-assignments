Central Collegiate Hockey Association

The Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) was a group of colleges and universities, mostly in the Midwestern United States plus one in Alaska, that played NCAA Division I hockey against one another every season. The conference, formed in 1971, folded after the 2012–13 season.

The end for the CCHA came after the Big Ten Conference, home to three of the CCHA's most important members (Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State), announced in 2011 that it would start a men's hockey league in the 2013–14 season. Soon after the Big Ten announcement, a group of six schools—five from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) plus CCHA member Miami (Ohio)—formed the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC), which began play in 2013–14. Within a few months, all of the other CCHA schools said they would also leave, with Western Michigan joining the NCHC, Notre Dame joining Hockey East, and the rest joining the WCHA.

The conference only sponsored men's ice hockey—only one of the CCHA's 11 final members had a varsity women's hockey team, namely Ohio State. The champion was automatically invited to the NCAA Division I men's hockey tournament.

The CCHA members in its final season of 2012–13 were:
