Clermont-Ferrand (in Occitan Clarmont-Ferrand / Clarmont of Auv√®rnhe) is a city in central-southern France, prefecture of the department of Puy-de-Dome and chief town of the Auvergne region. Partly for historical reasons, the city is often called the "Clermont".

It is officially the 23rd city in France with 143,000 inhabitants in 2010. It is at the heart of a conurbation of nearly 300,000 inhabitants. With 463,891 inhabitants in 2010 according to INSEE, the urban area has the 17th and 12th of urban France.

The modern city was born from the union of two separate towns, Clermont and Montferrand. This union has been imposed by Louis XIII in 1630 (Edict of Troyes) and was confirmed by Louis XV.

While Montferrand was founded in the early twelfth century by the Counts of Auvergne on the model of fortified cities in the Southwest, Clairmont is much older, as it existed in ancient times. The earliest mention of the existence of Clairmont contained in the work of Strabo, the early first century. The city was then known Nemossos described as a "metropolis of Arvernes." She later took the name of Augustonemetum then Arverni.
