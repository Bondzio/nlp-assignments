Presidential portrait (United States)

An Official Presidential Portrait is an oil portrait painted of a President of the United States of America. In recent years, the official portrait of the President is a photograph until after they leave office. 

The tradition started with Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington. Presidents often display the official portraits of Presidents they admire (on loan from the National Portrait Gallery) in the Oval Office, or around the White House.
