LeToya Luckett

LeToya Nicole Luckett (born March 11, 1981), known professionally as LeToya, is an American R&B singer, actress and songwriter. She is a former member of the R&B female group, Destiny's Child with whom she won two Grammy Awards, but when the group was successfully prompted in the world she was forced to leave.

When interviewed by MTV News, Luckett said that she and LaTavia Roberson created a new group called Anjel. Auditions were made, then Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin were selected as members. The group recorded demo songs. Their production company which handled the group fell through, and the members of Anjel went on to pursue solo projects.

In 2004, Capitol Records signed Luckett, then she started her solo career. Her solo debut album, "LeToya", topped the U.S. "Billboard" 200 albums chart in July 2006 and was certified platinum by the RIAA in December 2006. The album spawned five singles. Two were released with promotional purpose, to see the audience reaction towards her, but "Torn" would be her most notable song. It achieved records on BET's top ten countdown show "106 & Park". She was also named "One of the Best New Artists of 2006" by AOL and the "Top Songwriter of 2006" by ASCAP. Luckett's second album, "Lady Love", was scheduled for a spring 2008 release. It was released in 2009. She is now on road with the stage play tour ""Rumors"".
