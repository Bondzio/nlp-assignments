Attack aircraft

Attack aircraft are military aircraft. They are designed for attacking enemy ground or naval forces, especially moving ground or naval forces, like tanks, soldiers and warships. Such aircraft attack their targets while flying low. They were much used in World War II, and later also took over the job of dive bombers. Attack aircraft can be fighter airplanes or helicopters.
