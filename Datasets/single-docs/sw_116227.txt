Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth

"Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth" plays differently from the other games. The games in the "Ace Attorney" series are courtroom dramas, but "Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth" focuses on pointing and clicking around the area, moving Edgeworth around the crime scenes to find evidence.

When it was being developed, it was called "NEW Gyakuten NOT Saiban" because it used the same setting and characters, but different gameplay. It is being directed by Tsuyoshi Yamazaki instead of Shu Takumi, who directed the other games were. By April 2008, they said that the game was 40% complete.
