German invasion of Norway

The German invasion of Norway occurred during the Second World War. It led to battles between the Allies and Germany. In April 1940, the United Kingdom and France came to help Norway by sending soldiers and warships. The Allies had to withdraw and the Norwegian government had to escape from Norway and seek exile in London. Even though the Germans occupied Norway, some Norwegians formed the Norwegian resistance and kept fighting the Germans. Norway held off the Germans for 62 days, making Norway the nation that withstood a German invasion for the longest period of time, after the Soviet Union.
