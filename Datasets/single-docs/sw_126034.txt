Tibetan Fox

The Tibetan Sand Fox ("Vulpes ferrilata") is a species of true fox. It is endemic to the high Tibetan Plateau in Nepal, China, and Kashmir, up to altitudes of about 5300 metres. It is sometimes referred to as the Tibetan Fox, or simply as the Sand Fox, but this terminology is confusing because the Corsac Fox (Vulpes corsac), which lives in arid environments north and west of the Tibetan Plateau, is often called the "Sand Fox" as well.
