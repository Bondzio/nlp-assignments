Anteater

Anteaters are mammals of the family Myrmecophagidae and the suborder Vermilingua. Anteaters live in South America and Central America.

Anteaters eat ants and termites. They have long, sharp claws and a long, sticky tongue. The tongue can be up to 60 cm long, as long as a person's arm. The anteater opens an ant nest with its claws. Then it licks up the ants with its tongue.
