Wheel 2000

Wheel 2000 (full title Wheel of Fortune 2000) was a childrens' television game show. It aired on Saturday mornings on CBS from September 13, 1997 to February 7, 1998. It was a spin-off of the television game show "Wheel of Fortune". It was hosted by David Sidoni.

Gameplay was the same as the adult version of "Wheel of Fortune", with some differences. Instead of money, players played for points. Winning a round won the player a prize. Players picked from three categories at the start of a round. A new category replaced the one picked in the next round. Other things included:


After a puzzle, a video clip about the puzzle was shown.

The winning player chose one of two prize packages, labeled "A" and "B." A puzzle was given, and all instances of the letters R, S, T, L, N, and E were shown. The player then picked three more consonants and a vowel. Solving the puzzle correctly in 10 seconds won the player the prize package.
