Scythians

The Scythians or Scyths.. They were origin of Buddhists, Hindus, 
Ancient Greek religion and Zoroastrianism.

The invasion of India by Scythian tribes from Central Asia, often referred to as the Indo-Scythian invasion, played a significant part in the history of South Asia as well as nearby countries. In fact, the Indo-Scythian war is just one chapter in the events triggered by the nomadic flight of Central Asians from conflict with tribe such as the Xiongnu in the 2nd century AD, which had lasting effects onBactria, Kabul, and India as well as far-off Rome in the west, and more nearby to the west in Parthia.

They were nomadic, famous for their skills at horse riding, who dominated the Pontic steppe (modern Ukraine and Southern Russia) throughout the ancient world. By the 2nd century AD the closely-related Sarmatians came to dominate the Scyths in this area. Much of our information about the Scyths comes from the famous Greek historian Herodotus (c. 440 BC) in his "Histories", and from archaeologically from the beautiful goldwork found in Scythian kurgan burial mounds in Ukraine and southern Russia.
