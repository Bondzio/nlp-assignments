Blouson

A blouson is a coat that is drawn tight at the waist, causing it to hang over the waist. Some of them have a hood. Its modern form is taken from the American flight jacket and police blouson. It is similar to the American Eisenhower jacket. It is now thought of as both sportswear and casual clothing.

In the 1970s it was a skinhead and popular pink jacket style. In 1993, blousons was worn as the clothing of choice at the APEC meeting held in Seattle, Washington in the United States. In the early 2000s, the jacket was popular casual wear in hip hop fashion.
The blouson jacket is worn by several police forces due to its sturdy design and heavy insulation. The United States' NYPD, Austria, New Zealand, Germany and the United Kingdom all use them.
