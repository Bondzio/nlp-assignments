Housecleaning

Housecleaning is getting rid of mess, trash, dirt, and unclean actions so a household is better-looking. 

A reason people houseclean is to be able to see parts of the floor and furniture otherwise hidden by clutter. Other reasons are to keep from getting spider bites or breathing problems from dust. People may sweep and vacuum when housecleaning. They can also hang up clothes, do the laundry, and wash windows. Soaking up spilled red wine is another example of cleaning a mess in a house. Washing a sponge, squeezing it out and placing it on a dish rack to dry are a part of housecleaning.

Clutter is too many things in the house. It is because the things have not been put away or because there is nowhere to put them, or both. Places people put things away are shelves, drawers, and hangers.

Cleaning house removes germs and other things which might cause infections

Dust could make a guest sneeze, cough, and get watery eyes. Dust could give someone a rash and trouble breathing. Dust could be made of smoke, cotton, soap particles, pollen, mold spores, dry cat spit, spider web remains, fur, tiny skin flakes, textile and insect fibers, food particles, mold spores, unusual smells, or something the guest is allergic to. Getting rid of those things protects people.

There are five main kinds of cleaning chemicals. 1. Surfactants make water able to get things wet faster. 2. Alkaline chemicals like soap and baking soda are able to get things like mud and hamburger grease off. 3. Acidic chemicals like vinegar and orange juice are able to get off things like mustard, wine, tea, coffee, rust, dry soap suds, and lime scale. 4. Flammable solvents like turpentine are able to remove things like paint. 5. Disinfectants kill germs like fungus and mold.
