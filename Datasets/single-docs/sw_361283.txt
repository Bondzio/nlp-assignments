In 1986, after Disney had moved into making mostly live-action movies, it was re-established as Walt Disney Feature Animation, taking on its current name in 2007. It has been known for making animated feature movies for The Walt Disney Company.

Walt Disney Animation Studios is headquartered in the Sorcerer's Hat building which was completed in 1995. It is in Burbank, California close to The Walt Disney Studios where its original animated studio was located. Satellite studios were around the world in locations like Paris, France, Tokyo, Japan and even at Disney's Hollywood Studios, one of the four theme parks in Walt Disney World, Florida. They were all closed down by 2004 because the 2D movies which the satellite studios made were unsuccessful.

Since 1937, Walt Disney Animation Studios has released 56 movies to theaters. The first one, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", was released in 1937. The newest one, "Moana", was released in 2016.
