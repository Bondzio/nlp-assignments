Bible de Genève

Bible de Genève is a French translation of the Bible, which was published in Geneva in 1535. The English Bible of 1560 which is called the Geneva Bible is a different translation.

The "Bible de Genève" was made by Pierre Robert Olivétan (c.1506—1538) who is believed to be a cousin of John Calvin. Olivétan published his first Bible translation in 1535 in Neuchâtel, a Swiss town. This translation has a preface by Calvin.
