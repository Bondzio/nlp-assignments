Nordvorpommern Rural District

Nordvorpommern ("North Western Pomerania") is a former district in the northern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. It is on the coast of the Baltic Sea, and it surrounds the coastal city of Stralsund. 

On the coast is a long peninsula, called the Darß. Between the Darß and the mainland there is a very shallow lagoon. the lagoon and the peninsula are part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park.

Until 1819 the area was controlled by Sweden. Then it became a part of Prussia. The modern district was made in 1994 by joining the three old districts of Grimmen, Ribnitz-Damgarten and Stralsund.
