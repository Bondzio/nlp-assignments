Final Solution

The Final Solution (German: Die Endl√∂sung) was a plan made by the Nazi Germany to kill millions of Jews and Gypsies (Roma and Sinti people of Romania and many other European countries) during World War II. On July 31 1941, Nazi leader Hermann Goering ordered the SS to make plans for a "complete solution of the Jewish question." At first people were simply shot dead, but in the autumn of 1941 the SS and police began using mobile killing vans. People were locked into the back of trucks which had been changed to allow the exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide to enter. The people sealed in the back of the truck were gassed.

Heinrich Himmler brought in a plan known as Operation Reinhard, named after SS General Reinhard Heydrich, who had been killed by Czech soldiers. Three camps were set up in Poland for the purpose of killing people. These were at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. In 1942 more death camps were set up in Poland at Majdanek, Chelmno, and Auschwitz. By the end of World War II about six million people had been killed.
