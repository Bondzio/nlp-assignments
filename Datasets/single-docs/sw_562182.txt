National Anthem of Saudi Arabia

The National Anthem of The Kingdom Saudi Arabia () was first officially adopted in 1950 with no lyrics and then again in 1984 with lyrics. The original composition was by Abdul-Rahman al-Khateeb (عبد الرحمن الخطيب) in 1947 and the brass instrumental version was later arranged by Seraj Omar (سراج عمر). The lyrics were written by Ibrahim Khafaji (إبراهيم خفاجي).

It is referred to simply as The National Anthem (' '), although it is commonly known by its incipit, Sārʿī (', "Hasten"), from "ʾ" (', "Hasten to glory and supremacy!"). The lyrics call upon the country to hasten to greatness and raise the flag, glorify God, and asks Him to grant the King of Saudi Arabia long life.

The instrumental version is called the Royal Salute ( "") which is also the name of the ceremony in which it is played to salute senior members of the royal family as well as diplomatic figures.
