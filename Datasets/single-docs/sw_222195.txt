Guy Dollman

Captain John Guy Dollman BA, FLS (1886-1942) (who was known as Guy Dollman) was a British zoologist and taxonomist. Dollman's Tree Mouse and Dollman's Vlei Rat are named after him.

Guy Dollman was the eldest son of the artist John Charles Dollman. He was born on 4 September 1886 and went to St Paul's School. He later went to St John's College Cambridge. In February 1907, when he was still a student, he was employed by the Department of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History). He spent most of his working life there as Assistant Keeper of Mammals.

In 1912, on an expedition to Vietnam, he discovered and named the Tonkin Snub-nosed Langur. He joined the British Army in 1915, and obtained a commission in the 19th London Regiment. He was injured in a bomb accident so he did not fight in the First World War.

In 1919, he returned to the museum. He was an adviser to the British group at the 1933 International Conference for the Preservation of the Flora and Fauna of Africa. This was the most important meeting about protecting nature before the Second World War. Dollman helped to decide which animal species needed protecting.

He travelled and wrote a lot with Walter Rothschild. Some of their writing included "New mammals from Dutch New Guinea" (which was published in 1932) and a book about tree kangaroos which was called "The Genus Dendrolagus" (which was published in 1936). He was also a very good artist, showing pictures at the Royal Academy. He also drew pictures for his own scientific writings.

Dollman died on 21 March 1942 when he was 65 years old.

Dollman is the binomial authority (the first person to name a species) for the following animals:
