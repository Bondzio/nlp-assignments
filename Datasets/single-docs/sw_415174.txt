Violin Concertos (Mozart)

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote at least five violin concertos between 1773 and 1776 in Salzburg, Austria, most likely for his own use as concertmaster of the Archbishop of Salzburg's orchestra.

This concerto is scored for violin solo, 2 oboes, 2 horns and strings, and was composed in Salzburg on April 14, 1773 or 1775. The date is uncertain. There are three movements: Allegro moderato; Adagio; Presto.

All three movements are written in sonata form, a form reserved by classical composers for their most serious works. The second movement is marked Adagio, a more intense tempo that Mozart's usual Andante.
