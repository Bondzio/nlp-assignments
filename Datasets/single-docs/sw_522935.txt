Kostandin Shpataraku

Kostandin Shpataraku (flourished 1736â€“67) was an Albanian painter of 18th century. 

Kostandin Shpataraku was born in Valesh village in the Shpat region of Albania. The region is located in the southern highland of Elbasan, Albania, in today's Gjinar which was originally in the Ottoman Empire.

Shpataraku was a painter in the Orthodox tradition of icons and Byzantine church frescoes, active between 1736 and 1767. His works combine Byzantine tradition and Italian Renaissance influences.

Shpataraku was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan. His family took his body and buried him in his village with his head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built later to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals, on September 21.

Many of his icons are in Ardenica Monastery, St. Jovan Vladimir's Church near Elbasan, Vithkuq, and in the "Museum of Medieval Art" in Korce. Many of his works belong to private collections.
