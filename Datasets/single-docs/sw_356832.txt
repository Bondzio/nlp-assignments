Corozal Town

Corozal Town is a town in the nation of Belize. It is the capital of Corozal District. Corozal Town is about 84 miles north of Belize City, and 9 miles from the border with Mexico. The population of Corozal Town, according to the 2010 census, is 9,871. Corozal was a private estate before becoming a town in the 1840s. It was mostly settled by Mestizo refugees from the Caste War of Yucat√°n. Much of the town was built over an ancient Maya city. This may have been the original Pre-Columbian town called Chetumal. Corozal Town was badly damaged by Hurricane Janet in 1955. It was mostly rebuilt afterwards.
