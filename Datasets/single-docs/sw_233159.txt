A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin

A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin is a book written by Harriet Beecher Stowe, the writer of "Uncle Tom's Cabin". She was trying to show that the stories she wrote about slaves in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" were true. However, later studies showed that Stowe had actually read lots of the books she wrote about in "A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin" after she had published her novel. It was first published in 1853 by Jewett, Proctor & Worthington.
