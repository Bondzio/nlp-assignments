False prophet

A false prophet is a person who claims to be a true prophet but really is not. A false prophet is also someone who uses prophecy to do evil.

The term is also used outside religion to describe someone who fervently promotes a theory which the speaker thinks is false.

In Christianity, false prophets are thought of as being inspired by Satan, or the Devil. False prophets are the opposite of prophets. False prophets try to deceive people and bring them away from god. They use false information to lead people away from god. There are many false prophets in the Bible.
