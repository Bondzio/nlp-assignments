2015 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season had a little less storms than usual, 11 storms, and four of them reached hurricane status. It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30. This is when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic. However the first named storm, Ana, developed nearly a month before the official start of the season, the first time this has happened since 2012’s Beryl and the earliest a hurricane has happened since 2003’s Ana. The season ended with the diminish of Kate 18 days before the official end.

Due to a strong El Niño, most agencies predicted that only 6–10 tropical cyclones would form; however, the number of tropical cyclones that formed this season was higher than what the agencies predicted.
