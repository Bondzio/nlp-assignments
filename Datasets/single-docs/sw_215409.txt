Treaty of Maastricht

The Treaty of Maastricht was a treaty signed between European countries, in the Dutch city of Maastricht, in 1992. This treaty made possible further integration between European states, and made possible the existence of the European Union, doing better than previous treaties such as the Treaty of Rome. European integration went even further with the Treaty of Lisbon, which was signed in 2007 and became effective in December 2009.
