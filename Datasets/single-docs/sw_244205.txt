Walden Media

Walden Media is a children's movie production and publishing company. It is best known for making "The Chronicles of Narnia" movie series. Its movies are usually about famous children's literature. For example, "Bridge to Terabithia". It also makes movies about biographies or historical happenings. It was started in 2001 by Michael Flaherty and Cary Granat. Granat was the head of Dimension Films. Flaherty was interested in good education for children. The two lived together at Tufts University. They met again to make Walden Media. They saw its purpose as making kids have fun. The company is owned by Christian Philip Anschutz. He said he wanted the movies "to be entertaining (fun), but also to be life affirming and to carry a moral message."
