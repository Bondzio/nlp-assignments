Shoemaker crater

The Shoemaker crater in Western Australia (formerly known as Teague Ring) is an obvious impact crater, the remains of an ancient meteorite strike.

It is in dry central Western Australia, about north-northeast of Wiluna. It is named after planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker.

At present it is dated to 1630 million years ago.
