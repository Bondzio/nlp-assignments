The movie premiered at the New York Film Festival. Many members of the audience, including Abel Ferrara's wife, walked from the movie theater. At a second showing of the movie the following day, Larry Fishburne and Nicholas St. John were booed from the stage.

Mark Caro, writing for the "Chicago Tribune" gave the movie only 1/2 star. He said "``King of New York,`` [is] a film more interested in leaving impressions than spinning a smooth narrative". He also said that both the star, Christopher Walken, and the movie "remains just out of grasp". 

Rotten Tomatoes gives the movie a rating of 71%. Roger Ebert gave the movie two stars. Janet Maslin from "New York Times" said the movie was "a chillingly ambiguous portrait of its title character."
