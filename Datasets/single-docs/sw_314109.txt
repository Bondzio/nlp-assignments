Armenia at the Olympics

Armenia first took part in the Olympic Games in 1994. They have taken part in all summer and winter Olympics since then. 

Before Armenia became independent, they competed in the Olympics as a part of the Soviet Union team. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Armenia got their own team.

The Armenian athletes have won nine medals altogether. They won these medals in wrestling, weightlifting and boxing.
