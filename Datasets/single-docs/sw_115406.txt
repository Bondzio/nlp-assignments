Saint Dominic

Saint Dominic (; 1170 – 6 August 1221) was the founder of a Catholic order, the Friars Preachers, often called the Dominicans or the Order of Preachers (OP). Dominic is the patron saint of astronomers and the Dominican Republic. He was born in Caleruega, half-way between Osma and Aranda in Old Castile, Spain. He is sometimes called Dominic of Osma or Dominic de Guzmán. 

In paintings, his sign is a star or a dog holding a burning torch in its mouth.
