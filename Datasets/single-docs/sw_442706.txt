Harry Harlow

Harry Frederick Harlow (October 31, 1905 â€“ December 6, 1981) was an American psychologist. He did experiments on rhesus monkeys in which he separated babies from their mothers.

Harlow was born Harry Israel on October 31, 1905. He changed his name from Israel because he did not want to be treated badly for seeming Jewish. Harlow started working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
