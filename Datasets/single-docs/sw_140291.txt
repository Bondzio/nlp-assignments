Beige

Beige is a very pale yellowish-cream color. 

The name comes from "beige cloth", a woolen fabric left in its natural color. It then came to be used for a range of light tints of yellow chosen for their neutral or pale warm colored appearance. 

In the 1920s, the meaning of the term "beige" expanded to the point where it is now also used for not only for pale yellows but also for a wide range of pale brown shades.

The first recorded use of "beige" as a color name in English was in 1887.
