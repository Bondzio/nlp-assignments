Green Party of Canada

The Green Party of Canada is a federal political party based in Canada. 

Although the party has had both leftist and centrist factions throughout their history, many of the members think that the left wing-right wing political spectrum doesn't capture the ecological orientation of an evolving Green Party.

The leader of the party is Elizabeth May. She was voted as leader when she defeated David Chernushenko and Jim Fannon in the leadership race with 65% of the vote on the first ballot.
