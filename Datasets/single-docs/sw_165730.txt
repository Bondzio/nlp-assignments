Junker (SS rank)

Junker was a Nazi rank that was used by the SS between the years of 1933 and 1945. The rank was a special rank held by those wanting to become officers in the armed part of the SS, first known as the "SS-Verfügungstruppe" and later as the "Waffen-SS".

The Junkerschule was a officer candidate school in Bad Tölz that trained men to become full SS officers.

The rank of SS-Junker was split into four levels, those being "Junker", "Oberjunker", "Standartenjunker", and "Standartenoberjunker".

The process for an Junker to become an SS officer usually took between 18 to 24 months to complete.
