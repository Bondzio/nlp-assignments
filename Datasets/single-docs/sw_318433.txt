Hovenia dulcis

Hovenia dulcis, the oriental raisin tree, is a plant which is native to Japan, Korea, Eastern China and the Himalayas. The plant is sent around throughout Korea.

Its height is about 10meters. The bark of the tree is dark gray. The flowers are white, and they grow between June and July. The tree grows fruits between September and October. The fruits are brown, and their shape is similar to chicken's claw.

The plant grows well in both shade and light. This plant is resistant to cold, but not the dry. This plant is salt-tolerant, so it thrives near the sea. This plant is also resistant to pollution, so it thrives in cities and other industrial areas. The seeds are sown from February to March. The germination rate (the number of seeds that begin to spore or grow) is about 2 â€“ 15%. Most trees begin to bud two years after they are planted.

The woods are used for many purposes like building, instruments, ships and furniture. Because the stem tastes sweet, it can also be eaten and can be used to make drinks. This stem is also used for medicine.
