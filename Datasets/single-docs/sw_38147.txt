Coney Island

Coney Island is a peninsula (formerly an island) in Brooklyn, New York. It is famous for its beaches, amusements like the Cyclone wooden roller coaster, Parachute Jump, and Wonder Wheel ferris wheel, boardwalk, and hot dogs. It became a seaside resort in the 19th century. 

It is unsure how Coney Island got its name. It may be because when the Dutch people arrived on Coney Island, there was a large population of rabbits, so they named it "Rabbit Island", which translates to "Coney Island" in English. It also may have been named by an Irish pirate, for islands in Sligo bay.
