Suba language

Suba is a language spoken by the Suba people of east Africa. It is almost extinct. It is a Bantu language believed to have developed from the interactions between the Luo and the Bantu speakers of Lusoga. These Lusoga migrated from the Baganda kingdom because of a conflict between tribes.
