Continuous function

In mathematics a function is said to be continuous if, roughly said, a "small change" in the input only causes a "small change" in the output. If this is not the case, the function is said to be discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an "uninterrupted line (or curve)". They can be drawn "without lifting the pen". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy.

Karl Weierstraß gave another definition of continuity: Suppose that there is a function "f", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that whenever formula_6, that makes formula_7. Intuitively: Given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the "absolute value" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made arbitrarily small, if the point x is "close enough" to formula_1.

There are also special forms of continuous, such as "Lipschitz-continuous". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y ∈ (a,b).
