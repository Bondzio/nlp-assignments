Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo is a 2005 American comedy movie. It was directed by Mike Bigelow and was produced by John Schneider, Adam Sandler, and Jack Giarraputo. "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" was released on August 12, 2005. It is the sequel to the 1999 movie "".


The movie gained negative reviews from critics and holds a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. At the Razzie Awards, the movie was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Screen Couple. Schneider won for Worst Actor.

Move critic Roger Ebert gave the movie a "zero star" rating and called it "aggressively bad, as if it wants to cause suffering to the audience" and on his show "Ebert and Roeper" "completely beneath contempt." He named it as the worst movie of 2005, and he included it in his list of most hated movies. Ebert also told off Schneider because of his obsessive defense of the movie series, referring to an incident where Los Angeles Times movie critic Patrick Goldstein called Schneider a "third-rate comic." Schneider responded by saying that Goldstein was a "third-rate, unfunny pompous reporter" and that he was not qualified to review the movie because he was not a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. Ebert, who had won the Pulitzer Prize, decided to criticize Schneider in his own review. He ended his review with the quote "Your movie sucks" which later became the title of a book that was published by Ebert.

Both Ebert and Schneider would later settle their differences, and Schneider sent a bouquet of flowers and his well wishes to Ebert who was recovering from thyroid cancer. Ebert would respond by saying "Rob Schneider might (in my opinion) have made a bad movie. He is not a bad man."
