C-flat major

C-flat major is a major scale based on C-flat. Its key signature has seven flats.

Its relative minor is A-flat minor, and its parallel minor is C-flat minor. This is usually replaced by B minor because Câ™­ minor's three double-flats make it generally impractical to use.

Its enharmonic equivalent is B major.

Most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent B major because it has just five sharps.
