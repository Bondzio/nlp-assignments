Conviction

In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. "not guilty"). A minor conviction is a warning conviction, and it does not affect the defendant but does serve as a warning. In Scotland there can also be a verdict of "not proven", which counts as an acquittal. A convicted person is also called a convict.
