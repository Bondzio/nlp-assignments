Emergency room

An emergency room (also called an emergency department) is a medical treatment facility. It specializes in emergency medicine. It also specializes in the acute care of patients who come in without telling anyone they were coming.

A 2005 patient study found an average emergency room wait time from 2 hours in Iowa to more than 5 hours in Arizona. The Midwest had the highest number of emergency room visits (460 per 1,000 people). The West had the lowest number.
