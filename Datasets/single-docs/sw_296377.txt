Hominin

Hominini is the tribe of Homininae that comprises humans ("Homo"), and all ancestors of "Homo sapiens" back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with "Sahelanthropus" as a key fossil.

A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus "Pan" (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the "human" branch, including genus "Homo" and its close relatives, but not "Pan". All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species.
