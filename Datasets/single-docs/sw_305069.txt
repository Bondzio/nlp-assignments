Adduction

Adduction is a movement. It brings a part of the anatomy closer to the sagittal plane of the body. It is the opposite of abduction.









Scallops have a central adductor muscle. It lets them open and close their shells. It is quite large and developed compared to other bivalves because they swim a lot.
