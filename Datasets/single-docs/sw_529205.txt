Luminator Bernocchi

Luminator Bernocchi is a lamp created in 1926 by the Italian entrepreneur Antonio Bernocchi. He commissioned a young architect Luciano Baldessari in Milan to make the first prototype. This prototype was first presented at the Milan Fair. In 1929, it was then presented in the Italian pavilion at the International Expo in Barcelona.

The Luminator was first made by Antonio Bernocchi. Bernocchi is considered the father of Italian design. From this project came the idea to create the first museum in the world dedicated not only to art but also to design. That was how the Bernocchi family decided to build a museum and donate it to the city of Milan. This building is the Palace Bernocchi Triennale.

The Luminator Bernocchi is the first real example of an historical product of Italian industrial design started by the Bernocchi family.
The Luminator Bernocchi is inspired by the Futurist art movement born in Milan thanks to money from patrons of the Bernocchi family members.
