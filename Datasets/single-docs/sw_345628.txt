Charyapada

The Charyapada is a collection of 8th-12th century Vajrayana Buddhist "caryagiti". They are mystical poems from the tantric tradition in eastern India. The Charyapada were meant to be sung. 

A manuscript of this anthology was found in the early 20th century. It shows early examples of the Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and Bengali languages. The writers of the Charyapada belonged to the various regions of Assam, Bengal, Orissa and Bihar. A Tibetan translation of the Charyapada was also kept in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. It is the earliest known example of Maithili poetry. According to Bengali scholar Haraprasad Shastri (1853â€“1931), Charyapada is also the collection of the oldest verses written in pre-Modern Bengali.
