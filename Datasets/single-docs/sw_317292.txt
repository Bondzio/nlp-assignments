Piano concerto

A piano concerto is a concerto written for piano and orchestra.

A classical piano concerto is often in three movements.


Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but there are many others which do not. Beethoven's fourth piano concerto includes a last-movement cadenza, and many composers have made innovations â€“ for example Liszt's single-movement concerti.
