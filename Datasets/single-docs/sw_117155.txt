Kirby is happily eating his cake, when it is suddenly stolen from him. He believes King Dedede is the culprit, and makes his way to King Dedede's castle. There, he discovers it was not Dedede who stole it, but the Squeaks, a band of mouse thieves. Kirby travels through several areas looking for his cake and fighting the Squeaks several times. He eventually confronts Daroach, the Squeaks' leader. After defeating Daroach, the mouse hands over the treasure chest he believes to contain Kirby's cake. Metaknight suddenly swoops in and nabs the chest, and goes through a sealed door. Kirby follows him through, and he confronts Metaknight. When Kirby opens the chest, an ancient evil comes out and infests Daroach. Kirby fights this evil being using the Star Staff, which grants him the "Triple Star" power. After freeing Daroach, Kirby is finally reunited with his piece of cake, and starts to eat it.
