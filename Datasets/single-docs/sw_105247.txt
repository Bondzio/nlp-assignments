Kaliningrad Oblast

Kaliningrad Oblast (, ) is an exclave of Russia bordered by Poland, Lithuania and Baltic Sea. The capital of Kaliningrad Oblast is Kaliningrad, formerly KÃ¶nigsberg.

It is quite unusual, first because it is not attached to Russia. It is an exclave, with no land connection to the rest of Russia, on the Baltic coast. It has a population of 941,873 (2010 Census). It has a continental climate ("Dfb" in the Koeppen climate classification).

Its territory was part of historical East Prussia (German: Nord-Ostpreussen), which was an exclave of Germany from World War I until 1945. That year, it was occupied by the Soviet Union. The region was later annexed to the Soviet Union under border changes of the Potsdam Agreement, when it was attached to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Most of its German population were killed or fled west to West Germany during the last months of the war. The rest were expelled between 1944 and 1950. Russian settlers were moved in and the population is now mainly Russian.
