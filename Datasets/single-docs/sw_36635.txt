Syd Barrett

Roger Keith "Syd" Barrett (6 January 1946 â€“ 7 July 2006) was an English musician. Barrett is most famous for starting the rock band Pink Floyd. He started the band in 1965 under a lot of different names. He also wrote the band's first album, "Piper at the Gates of Dawn". After this record came out, he used a lot of psychedelic (mind-changing) drugs. He was forced out of the band in 1968. He made two more records after he left the band, but they were not popular because the lyrics were very unusual, and because the music did not always have a steady beat. He later ended up with mental health problems, possibly because of all the drugs he took. Some of his most famous solo songs are "Dark Globe", "Octopus" and "Vegetable Man".

Barrett was born in Cambridge and died there, of pancreatic cancer.
