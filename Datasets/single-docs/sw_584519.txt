Thomas Bloodworth

Sir Thomas Bloodworth (sometimes spelled Bludworth) was an English merchant and politician. He was Lord Mayor of London from October 1665 to October 1666. He was in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1679.

He was blamed for the spread of the Great Fire of London. This is because, as the Mayor, he did not give approval to stop the fire.
