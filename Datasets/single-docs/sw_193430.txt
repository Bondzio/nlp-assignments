Oligotroph

An oligotroph is an organism that can survive with relatively few nutrients. Because there are few nutrients, such organisms grow slower. Their metabolism usually runs at a slower rate. The population density is generally low. 

Environments where oligotrophs can be found include the deep oceans.
