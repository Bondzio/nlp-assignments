A popular venue of antisexuals is the Antisex.info (Antisexual Stronghold) website founded by Yuri Nesterenko. He launched a FidoNet-based antisexual community in 1995. While putting forward the slogan "Say No to sex", the spokesmen said that no sexual urges are so violent that they may not be deterred through mental reason, or else transformed through abstinence. Some members of the IAM say they have successfully overcome the desire for sex.
