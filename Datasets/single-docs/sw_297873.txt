Robert O'Hara Burke

Robert O'Hara Burke (1821â€”1861) was an Irish policeman, who led the Burke and Wills expedition. This was the largest and best equipped expedition to explore Australia. They successfully crossed the country, from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1861. The expedition ended in disaster when Burke and his second in command, William John Wills died from starvation at Cooper Creek on their way back to Melbourne.
