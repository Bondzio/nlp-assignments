On the November 4 2011 episode of "SmackDown", Colón debuted on the main roster as a heel under the ring name Epico. He faced Sin Cara but lost by disqualification after Hunico ran in and attacked Sin Cara.

Epico then began teaming with Primo, with Rosa Mendes as their manager. Epico and Primo defeated Air Boom (Evan Bourne and Kofi Kingston) at a "Raw" live event on January 15, 2012, in Oakland, California to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. They lost the championships to Kofi Kingston and R-Truth on the April 30 episode of "Raw".

On the September 30 edition of "Raw", Epico and Primo changed their gimmicks and debuted as Los Matadores, as a face team of two masked Spanish bullfighters with El Torito as their mascot. They defeated 3MB in their debut.
