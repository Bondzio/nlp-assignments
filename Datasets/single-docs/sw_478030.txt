Ambrosia beetle

Ambrosia beetles are beetles of the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae (Coleoptera, Curculionidae. They live in symbiosis with ambrosia fungi and bacteria. The beetles make tunnels in dead trees where they grow fungal gardens for nutrition.

During their evolution, most weevils became more or less dependant on fungi. Some bark beetles that ate phloem are using more fungi. These beetles are called "mycophloeophages".
