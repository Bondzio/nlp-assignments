International Women of Courage Award

The International Women of Courage Award is an American award. Every year the United States Department of State gives the award to women around the world who have shown the ability to lead other people, the ability to do something that they know is difficult or dangerous, the ability to deal well with new or difficult situations and to find solutions to problems, and who are ready to give up something to help to make people aware of women's rights.

U. S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice started the award in 2007, on March 8, International Women's Day. In many countries in the world, people do something special on this day. Each United States embassy can recommend one woman to be considered for this award.
