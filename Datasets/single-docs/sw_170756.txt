Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex

Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex was born (27 January 1773 â€“ 21 April 1843), was the sixth son of George III and his consort, Queen Charlotte. He was the only son of the King and Queen not to pursue an army or navy career, but he did consider becoming a cleric in the Church of England.

Augustus Frederick married twice, but neither was legal in the United Kingdom because under the Royal Marriages Act he should have asked permission from the King first.
