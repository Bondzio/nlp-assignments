Economic deficit

Economic Deficit is a status of financial health in which expenditures exceed revenue (more money being spent than coming in). The term "budget deficit" is most commonly used to refer to government spending rather than business or individual spending. When referring to accrued federal government deficits, the term "national debt” is used.
