Taxali Gate

The Taxali Gate is one of the 12 gates of the old medieval walled city of Lahore, now in Pakistan. It dates from Mughal times.

The Royal Mint (where coins were made) of the Mughal Empire or "Taxal", was here. The gate was named for that. 

Today, there is no mint here. There is a very famous shoe market, Sheikhupurian Bazaar. People can go there and try "Desi" (local) foods like "Siri Paya" and many types of sweets. 

The world-famous Heera Mandi red light area is also in this area. This was made famous in Rudyard Kipling's novel, "Kim" (published 1901).
