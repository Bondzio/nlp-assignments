Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire

A trailer for the game was shown at Nintendo's 2014 E3 video. The trailer included new gameplay footage, as well as, the new playable character designs and new Mega Evolutions for Sceptile and Swampert that were not in "X and Y" like Blaziken was.

"Omega Ruby" and "Alpha Sapphire" were given positive review. IGN rated the game a 7.8 out of 10. Kallie Plagge of IGN sai that she liked the 3D reinvention of the Hoenn region and online functionality. She was critical of the HMs needed to play the game and the perceived imbalance that favored Water-type Pokémon (she played Alpha Sapphire). She said that "Too much water" was a negative. GameSpot rated the game 8 out of 10. Peter Brown of GameSpot said that he liked the 3D visuals and the super training mechanic but didn't think that the game did not fix general issues in the game formula.

As of June 30, 2015, "Omega Ruby" and "Alpha Sapphire" have sold 10.27 million copies worldwide.
