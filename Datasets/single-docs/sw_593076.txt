Collateral adjective

A collateral adjective is an adjective whose word origin is different from the noun it represents. English uses many collateral adjectives from French, Latin, and Greek, since much of its own vocabulary came from these languages. For example, the adjective form of "horse", which is a native English word, is "equine", which is borrowed from the Latin word "equus" of the same meaning. So "equine" is a collateral adjective of "horse". When describing a science describing the study of horse, one would call it equine science. The collateral adjective of "moon" is "lunar", which comes from the Latin word "luna". Instead of calling it the "moon calendar", it is called the "lunar calendar". Sometimes collateral adjectives can exist alongside derived adjectives, or adjectives formed from the same noun it describes. For example, while "father" has the denomial adjective "fatherly", it also has the collateral adjective "paternal", which comes from the Latin word "pater", which means also "father".
