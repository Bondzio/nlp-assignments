Indian Institute of Science

Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is a public university for scientific research. It is located in Bangalore, India. Jamshetji Tata gave active support to establish this institute. He is one of the earliest industrialists of India. IISc is well known as India's finest research university.

In 1893, Jamshetji Tata had a chance meeting with Swami Vivekananda on a ship from Japan to Chicago. Then, Jamshetji Tata discussed his plan with Vivekananda to bring Iron and Steel industry to India. Five years later, Tata wrote a letter to Vivekananda about his desire to establish a research institution. He also asked Vivekananda for guidance in this matter. Vivekananda softly declined this proposal.

The government of Mysore donated (371 acres or 1.50 sq km) to build the institute. They also agreed to donate 50,000 [rupee]]s annually. The institute was established in 1909. It had two departments - Department of General and Applied Chemistry and Electro Technology. Morris Travers became the first director of IISc.
