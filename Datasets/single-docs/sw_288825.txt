Fuckin' Perfect

Fuckin' Perfect (also known as "Perfect") is a song by American singer-songwriter Pink. It was released as the second single from her album, "Greatest Hits... So Far!!!" on December 14, 2010. The song was written by Pink with Tre' Shon Jenkins, Max Martin and Shellback. They also produced the song.

The song is similar to Pink's previous single, "Raise Your Glass". This is because it tells people to accept each other for who they are.

The video has been debated, as it contains topics such as depression, self-harm, and suicide.

The song became a top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
