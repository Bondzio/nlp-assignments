Chromebook

A Chromebook is a laptop using the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system. 

It uses the internet. Most applications and data are in the "cloud". A Chromebook is an example of a thin client. This is a lightweight computer which uses remote access to a server. It depends heavily on another computer (its server) to do its computation.
