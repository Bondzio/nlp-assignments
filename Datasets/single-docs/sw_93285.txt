ISO 3166-2:GB

ISO 3166-2:GB is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) coding system that gives geocodes to administrative divisions of the United Kingdom:
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK, but ISO offers codes for them under "GB-".

The first part of each code is the ISO 3166-1 code GB for the United Kingdom. The second part is a three-letter code which is the same as in the British Standard BS 6879.

The ISO has also issued codes for some areas with Welsh names and codes.

These codes are used by the BS. They were added to ISO 3166-2 in Newsletter 9, except for the Isle of Man and Channel Islands:


BS also has Welsh language code for Welsh names of Wales and its subdivisions, where they differ from the English language names. These are not listed here.
