Pothohari dialect

Pothohari (or Potwari or Pahari-Potwari) is a dialect of Punjabi spoken in the Potwar district in northern Punjab.

Punjabi and Urdu/Hindi are spoken in a region that has had ethnic and identity conflict, so have been exposed to the dialect versus language question.

Pothohari was historically classified as dialect of Punjabi. Recently it was claimed as a language instead of being a dialect of Punjabi. However these claims are controversial.
