Bart Simpson

Bart Simpson is a fictional character in "The Simpsons". At the age of ten-twelve (the Ullman shorts - season 1) and thirteen (since season 2), he sounds like a girl and is the oldest child of Marge and Homer Simpson. He is the brother of Lisa and Maggie. Bart is someone who does not like school. At the time when the Simpsons was launched T-shirts were released that had a picture of Bart saying "Underachiever. And proud of it". Nancy Cartwright is the voice of Bart. Bart had an 8 year old love interest named Niki/Nikki. He's a skateboarder.

He likes to ride on a skateboard and makes Prank phone calls to Moe's Tavern to annoy the owner, Moe Szyslak.

Bart goes to Springfield Elementary along with his 8-year-old sister Lisa. Bart often gets grade Fs in school, whereas Lisa gets A grades. At Springfield Elementary, Bart's best friend is Milhouse Van Houten. Bart has received detention multiple times, and during the start of the show he is seen writing things repeatedly on a blackboard as a form of punishment. He is a good pranker.

The character of Bart is an anagram of brat. Matt Groening was going to name the character Matt, but he realized that would be a giveaway, so he decided to name him Bart.
