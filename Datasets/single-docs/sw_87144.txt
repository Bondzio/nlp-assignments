Skype

Skype () is a software program that uses the internet to make telephone calls. The software was created by the Swedish and Danish Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Janus Friis. It is for Microsoft Windows (2000, XP, Vista and Windows Mobile), Mac OS X and Linux. By using VoIP to make the calls, it is very cheap to call another phone. It does not cost money to call another Skype user. Every Skype user has a unique username which other users can use to talk with them. Skype also has additional features such as video calls and multiple members in a conversation. In the chat you can also find a selection with a variety of emojis available.


Skype has an encryption system for security. This system cannot be turned on or off. Skype provides an uncontrolled registration system for users. People can use the system safely without revealing their real-life identity to other users of the system, but there is no way to know that the person they communicate with is the one they say they are.
