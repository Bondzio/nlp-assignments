Middle Angles

The Middle Angles were an important ethnic group in the kingdom of Mercia during the Anglo-Saxon period. It is probable that Angles moved into the Midlands from East Anglia early in the 6th century. The area they occupied is now centred around modern Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. They were in place before the reign of Penda (c.626-655). He made his eldest son, Peada, King of the Middle Angles in 653. For some time they kept their own identity in Mercia. The Middle Angles had their own bishop based in Leicester.
