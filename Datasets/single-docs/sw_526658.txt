Serekh

A serekh was an important type of heraldic crest used in Ancient Egypt.

A serekh was a symbol which combined a view of a palace facade and a plan (top view) of the royal courtyard. The word "serekh" comes from the Egyptian word for "facade". There are many different serekhs on different types of objects. Many different decorations and details of the facade are shown in many different examples. It seems that there were no strict rules for the design of the serekh.

A serekh was normally used as a royal crest, showing the name of the pharaoh. They have been found as far back as the predynastic Naqada II (Gerzean) period (ca. 3400 BC.). The hieroglyphs forming the king's name were placed inside a rectangular area above the serekh. This represented the royal courtyard. Additionally, the falcon of the god Horus, or in a few cases the chimera of Seth, is on top the serekh. 

From the Old Kingdom period onward, the word serekh appears in old papyri.
