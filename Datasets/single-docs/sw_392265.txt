Milo O'Shea

Milo O'Shea (2 June 1926 â€“ 2 April 2013) was an Irish-American actor and personality. He was known for his role as Leopold Bloom in "Ulysses".

O'Shea was born on 2 June 1926 in Dublin, Irish Free State. He studied at Synge Street. O'Shea was married to Maureen Toal from 1952 until they divorced in 1974. Then he was married to Kitty Sullivan until his death in 2013. 

O'Shea starred as Leopold Bloom in Joseph Strick's 1967 "movie" version of Ulysses. Among his other well-known movie roles in the 1960s were as the well-intentioned Friar Laurence in Franco Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" and as the villainous Dr. Durand Durand (who tries to kill Jane Fonda's character by making her literally die of pleasure) in Roger Vadim's classic "Barbarella" (both movies were released in 1968). In 1984, O'Shea reprised his role as Dr. Durand Durand (credited as Dr. Duran Duran) for the Duran Duran concert movie "Arena", since his character inspired the band's name.
