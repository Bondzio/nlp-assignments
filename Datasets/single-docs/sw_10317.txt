Eurovision Song Contest

The Eurovision Song Contest is a song contest run by the European Broadcasting Union that started in 1956. Different singers representing countries in Europe compete every year.

Famous past winners include ABBA (representing their native Sweden in 1974), CÃ©line Dion (though Canadian, she represented Switzerland) in 1988, Lordi (Finland, 2006) and Conchita Wurst (Austria, 2014).

One of Eurovision's most famous moments was in 1990 when Spain's entry suffered a technical fault at the start of the song but it was soon performed without any further problems.

The latest winner of the Eurovision Song Contest is Salvador Sobral of Portugal, who achieved his country's first ever victory with the song "Amar pelos dois" in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2017.
