Order of Canada

The Order of Canada was set up in 1967 by Queen Elizabeth II, to reward service to Canada. 

It is at the top of Canada’s honours system. It has three classes or ranks to recognize a lifetime of outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation.

Only Canadian citizens can have the award, but every year up to five foreigners can be given an honorary award. 

The Order of Canada’s motto is ().

Given to recognize a lifetime of outstanding achievement and merit of the highest degree, especially in service to Canada or to humanity at large.

For a lifetime of achievement and merit of a high degree, especially in service to Canada or to humanity at large.

A Member of the Order of Canada has a lifetime of distinguished service in or to a particular community, group or field of activity

Appointments to the order are usually announced twice a year, at the end of December (the New Year's Honours List) and at the end of June to mark Canada Day. This is the same system as in the United Kingdom, except the Queen's Official Birthday at the beginning of June is marked instead.

Only a certain number of appointments can be made each year:
