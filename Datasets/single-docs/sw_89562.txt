Judith

Judith is a female given name. It comes from the Hebrew word "Yəhûḏîṯ", meaning either "praised one" or "a woman from Judea". The name's popularity goes back to the story told below.

In the first half of the 1st millennium BC, an Assyrian king, Nebuchadnezzar, wanted to conquer Israel. An Israeli woman, called Judith, went to Nebuchadnezzar's general, Holofernes, and offered to have sex with him. Holofernes used to drink wine before sex. When he was drunk, Judith cut off his head and saved Israel.
