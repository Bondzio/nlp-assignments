Eastern Bloc

The term Eastern Bloc referred to the former Communist states of Eastern and Central Europe, including the countries of the Warsaw Pact, along with Yugoslavia and Albania, which were not aligned with the Soviet Union after 1948 and 1960 respectively. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) arranged economic cooperation among the members.

Communist governments were initially installed in a Bloc politics process that included extensive political and media controls, along with a Soviet approach to restricting emigration. Events such as the split of Josip Broz Tito and Berlin Blockade prompted stricter control. While the Bloc persisted through revolts, such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, its command economies experienced inefficiencies and stagnation preceding the Bloc's dissolution. Counterrevolutions in 1989 dissolved the Soviet Bloc.
