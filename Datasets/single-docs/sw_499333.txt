Division of Wakefield

The Division of Wakefield is an Australian electoral division in the state of South Australia. It covers an area from the northern suburbs of Adelaide to the Clare Valley, 135 km north of Adelaide. It includes the suburbs of Elizabeth, Craigmore, Munno Para, Virginia, and part of Salisbury, and the towns of Gawler, Balaklava, Clare, Kapunda, Riverton, Mallala, Freeling, Tarlee, Williamstown, and parts of Port Wakefield.

The Division was named after Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who planned settlements in South Australia, Western Australia, New Zealand and Canada. It was set up in 1903. 

Sir Frederick Holder and Neil Andrew (1998â€“2004) were Speaker of the House. Holder was also Premier of South Australia on two occasions. Holder's death in 1909 caused a by-election. In 1931 the death of Charles Hawker also caused another by-election.
