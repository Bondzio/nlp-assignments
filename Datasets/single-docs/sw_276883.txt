Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans

Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans (13 October 1648 – 14 January 1664) was born at the Château de Saint Germain en Laye and was the youngest surviving daughter of Gaston of Orléans and his second wife Marguerite of Lorraine. From birth, she was styled "Mademoiselle de Valois". She was the favourite sister of "La Grande Mademoiselle". She grew up in the company of her sisters at the Château de Blois. Under the influence of her paternal aunt Christine, Dowager Duchess of Savoy, she was engaged to her first cousin Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy. 

Orléans married the Duke of Savoy by proxy at the Palais du Louvre on 4 March 1663. The couple met for the first time at Annecy on 3 April 1663 where they were married officially. The homesick princess soon died at the Royal Palace of Turin childless at the age of 15. She was buried at Turin Cathedral where she rests today. Her husband married again to Marie Jeanne of Savoy by whom he had a son.
