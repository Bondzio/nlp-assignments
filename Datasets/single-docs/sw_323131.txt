Chicago Whales

The Chicago Whales were a professional baseball team that played in Chicago, Illinois, during 1914 and 1915. They were members of the Federal League, a short-lived attempt at a third major league. The Whales were owned by a group led by Chicago restaurant owner Charles Weeghman. They played their home games at Weeghman Park, which is now Wrigley Field.
