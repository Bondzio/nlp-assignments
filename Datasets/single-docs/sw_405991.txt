Hypoactive sexual desire disorder

Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a sexual condition that is characterized by the lack of sexual fantasy and desire for sexual activity. For this to be judged as a disorder, the condition has to cause strong distress or interpersonal troubles, and should not be better accounted for by another mental disorder or drugs. The condition was first discovered around the late 1960s or early 1970s. The subtypes include women or men earlier having sexual interests for their partner, though that interest has since cooled down or faded away. In some cases, sexual partners, female or male, may have never had sexual desire to begin with. The condition may be triggered through other health problems.
