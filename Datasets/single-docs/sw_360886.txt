ENCODE

ENCODE is the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. Encode was launched in 2003 to identify all the functional elements (working bits) in the human genome. The work was done by over 400 scientists in 32 laboratories in the US, UK, Spain, Singapore and Japan. Their findings were published in 30 open-access papers in three journals, "Nature", "Genome Biology" and "Genome Research". It is the most detailed analysis to date of the human genome.

A simplified account of their main findings is as follows:
