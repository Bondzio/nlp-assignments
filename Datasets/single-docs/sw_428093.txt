Cyclonic separation

A cyclonic separation is a process to take out all of the unwanted particles from air, gas or steam. The process uses the vortex separation process and does not use air filtering. It uses rotational and gravitational force to separate the unwanted particles. The process is done in a cyclone or cyclone separator.
