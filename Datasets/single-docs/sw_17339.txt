Oasis (band)

Oasis were an English rock band. They formed in Manchester, England in 1991. Before the band split in August 2009 people in the band were Noel Gallagher (lead guitar / vocals), Liam Gallagher (vocals), Colin 'Gem' Archer (rhythm guitar), Andy Bell (bass) and Chris Sharrock (drummer). Because the band is quite an old band they have had quite a few people play with them in the past. 

Liam Gallagher formed a new band called Beady Eye with Gem Archer, Andy Bell and Chris Sharrock. Noel Gallagher started a solo career. He released his first solo album in 2011.
