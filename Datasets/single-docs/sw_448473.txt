Cars 3 is a 2017 American movie made by Pixar, directed by Brian Fee, and produced by Kevin Reher. It is the third film in the "Cars" movie series and was released by Walt Disney Pictures on June 16, 2017. In the "Cars" trilogy, "Cars 3" is the next movie after "Cars 2", which is a sequel to the original "Cars" movie.

Lightning McQueen faces Jackson Storm, his high-tech rival who uses technology to win. He then makes friends with Cruz Ramirez, who needs training in racing, and the two learn many tricks from Smokey, who once trained Doc Hudson (Lightning's trainer in the original "Cars" movie). Lightning and Cruz then go to Florida to use what they learned to beat Storm, and in the end, both of them win.
