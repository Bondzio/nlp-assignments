2007 United Kingdom floods

The 2007 floods in the United Kingdom were a series of major floods that happened in many places across the country during the summer of 2007.

In Gloucestershire, there was a flash flood from the River Severn and a lot of extreme rainfall. It is estimated that 23 people died and nearly all of Gloucestershire was trapped in their homes for the summer holidays. The water was around four foot deep, and it got into most people's homes. The repairs would have cost about 3 thousand pounds per home.
