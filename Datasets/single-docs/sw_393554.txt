Daína Chaviano

Daína Chaviano (born 1960 in Havana, Cuba) is a Cuban writer. She is thought to be one of the three most important female fantasy and science fiction writers in the Spanish language, along with Angélica Gorodischer (Argentina) and Elia Barceló (Spain), forming the so-called “feminine trinity of science fiction in Latin America.” She is the cousin of Cuban-Mexican actor César Évora.
