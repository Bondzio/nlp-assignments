Kilkhampton

Kilkhampton is a village and parish in northeast Cornwall, United Kingdom. The village is on the A39 road about four miles (6Â km) north-northeast of Bude. The population of the parish was 1,193 in the 2001 census. 

The remains of a late Norman period castle known as Penstowe Castle are 500 metres west of the village. Further west, at Stowe, is the site of the grand mansion of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath, built in 1680 but demolished in 1739: some of the stonework was reused at Penstowe, also in the parish.
