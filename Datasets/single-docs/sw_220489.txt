Doom 3

Doom 3 (or "Doom III" in roman numerals), is a sequel to the first-person shooter game "Doom 2". It was created by iD Software, and came out in 2004. It was the first to not be based on the same game engine as "Doom" and "Doom 2", and had 40 levels. Doom 3 has a very dark environment, and the player carries a flashlight to light the way, although the flashlight can't be used at the same time as the weapons, except in the BFG Edition.
