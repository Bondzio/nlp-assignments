Princess Élisabeth of France

Princess Élisabeth of France, "Granddaughter of France" (Élisabeth Philippine Marie Hélène de France (3 May 1764 – 10 May 1794), known as Madame Élisabeth, was a French princess. She was the youngest sibling of King Louis XVI. During the French Revolution, she stayed with the king and his family. She was executed at Place de la Révolution in Paris during the "Reign of Terror" in the French Revolution. 

Élisabeth was the youngest child of the dauphin and dauphine of France. She was born during the reign of her grandfather, Louis XV. She grew up in the Palace of Versailles. She was always close to her older sister Clotilde. The two sisters were raised together by Madame de Marsan. 

Élisabeth was a skillful rider. She was also interested in art. Several of her drawings are in the museum of the Château de Versailles. In 1774, her grandfather, Louis XV, died. Her elder brother became king as Louis XVI.

Élisabeth was deeply religious. She was devoted to her brother the king. She refused to marry so that she could stay in France. In 1777, a marriage was suggested to Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. He was the son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and brother of her sister-in-law, Queen Marie Antoinette. Élisabeth declined with her brother's consent.

Élisabeth was executed during the French Revolution. She was buried at the Cimetière des Errancis, Paris. Her body was later moved to the Catacombs of Paris. The Cause of Beatification of Élisabeth was introduced in 1924. It has not yet been completed.
