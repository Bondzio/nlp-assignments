Tunisia at the Olympics

Tunisia was first at the Olympic Games in 1960. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. Tunisia has never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

The National Olympic Committee for Tunisia was formed in 1957.
