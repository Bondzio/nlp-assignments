Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel

Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel is the sequel to the movie "Alvin and the Chipmunks". It is a live-action/CGI movie. It was first set to be shown in theaters on March 19, 2010, but the date was changed to December 23, 2009. The movie introduces the Chipettes. The movie stars Zachary Levi, David Cross, and Jason Lee and the voices of Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, Jesse McCartney, Amy Poehler, Anna Faris, and Christina Applegate. The movie is being filmed at Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, CA.

In the sequel, Dave makes Alvin, Simon and Theodore go to school, saying that it is "good for them." He does not know that the Chipmunks feel like "Chipmunks Out of Water" because of all the (human) children around. Meanwhile, Ian (after the Chipmunks dealt him a serious blow) is freed from jail and searches the world for animals who can sing and dance. He finds the Chipettes and cannot wait to make them famous and get back at the Chipmunks.

In 2009, Betty Thomas signed on to direct.
