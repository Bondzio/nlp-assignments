Leopold Stokowski, (born near London, 18 April 1882; died 13 September 1977) was a famous orchestral conductor. He conducted many of America's greatest orchestras. Many people will recognize him from Disneyâ€™s film "Fantasia" in which he conducts the orchestra and is seen shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Stokowski had a long conducting career which started in 1909. He appeared in public for the last time in 1975 but continued making recordings until June 1977, a few months before his death at the age of 95.
