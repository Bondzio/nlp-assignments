Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST, TJ, Jefferson) is a high school in Virginia, United States. The school is a public school. It is part of the Fairfax Country Public Schools (FCPS). TJHSST is a selective school, which means that only a small group of people can go to the school. To decide who can go to the school, applicants (people who wants to go to the school) need to take an admission test, get a teacher recommendation, write essays, write a resume (a paper telling about who you are), and have good grades before. TJHSST is a very good school. "U.S. News & World Report" said that the school was the best public high school in the country from 2007 to 2013. In 2014 and 2015, TJHSST was first place again in Newsweek's "America's Top Schools" ranking.
