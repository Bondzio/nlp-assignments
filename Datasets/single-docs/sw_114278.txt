Vidalia onions

Vidalia onions are a variety of onions. They are native to Toombs County, Georgia. They are unique from other onions in that they are sweeter in taste. Southeast Georgia's mild climate, the area's sandy, low sulfur soil, exclusive seedvarieties, and precise farming practices make this original sweet onion, mild and flavorful.
