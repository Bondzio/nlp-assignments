Children's Day

Children's Day is a special day that is all about the caring and fun for children. Not many people celebrate this day but celebrations can go as far as taking a day off school, and doing something fun with your child/s for that day. It was invented in 1856 in the USA, and is celebrated in some countries on various dates.

Universal Children's Day takes place annually on 20 November. It was first proclaimed by the United Kingdom in 1954. On 20 November 1959 the United Nations adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 20 November 1989.
