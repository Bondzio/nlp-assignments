Serbian language

Serbian is South Slavic language spoken by Serbs, primarily in Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and some parts of neighboring countries. It is also spoken by a large number of Serbs in diaspora, mainly in Central European countries, North America and Australia. The language is European and south slavic. This language got a complete makeover in the mid-1800s by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić; when it was modernized from the times of Middle Ages, when "Old Serbian" was still spoken. Total number of speakers worldwide today is estimated to be more than 12 million.
