Robert Knox

Robert Knox (4 September 1791 â€“ 20 December 1862) was a Scottish anatomist, zoologist, ethnologist and doctor. He is best known for the Burke and Hare murders. Some of his work had controversy because he tried to prove that Anglo-Saxons were superior to other people.

Robert Knox was born in Edinburgh's North Richmond Street to Mary and Robert Knox. His father was a teacher of mathematics and philosophy. He had smallpox as an infant, which blinded his left eye and changed his face. He was educated at the Royal High School, where he bullied his friends.

In 1810, he joined medical classes in Edinburgh. He became interested in transcendentalism.

Knox graduated from Edinburgh University in 1814.

Knox married his wife Susan in 1824.
