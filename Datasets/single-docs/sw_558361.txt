Hayride

A hayride, which can also be called a hayrack ride, is an American activity where people go on a ride in an open truck, or wagon pulled by a tractor. Inside of the ride there is hay or straw for the people to sit on. Hayrides in the past were a way to celebrate the Autumn harvest. Hayrides today are usually started to give farms or companies a way to make more money during the fall. Sometimes hayrides are run by companies that help farms set up hayrides for people.

Hayrides on Halloween are called 'haunted hayrides'. During the fall, a hayride might let people stop near some pumpkins and pick one. These hayrides can put on a show with special effects and actors dressing up as ghosts, monsters, and other spooky creatures to attract people who like to get scared and make more money during the Halloween season.

Even though hayrides are supposed to be a way for people to have fun, there have been times when hayrides have flipped over or gone off of the road and caused people to get hurt or die. Other kinds of accidents can happen when hayrides crash into other vehicles on or close to roads.
