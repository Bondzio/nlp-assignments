Za誰

Za誰 is a technique used in agriculture. Holes are dug in the soil to catch water. They have been used in the western Sahel area to make soil healthier and grow more plants.

Yacouba Sawadogo, a farmer from Burkina Faso, is bringing back za誰 holes. He came up with the idea of filling them with manure and compost as food for plants. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help further break up the soil. He also made the holes slightly bigger than the traditional ones. Za誰 holes help trees, sorghum, and millet make up to 500% more food or wood.
