Social issue

A social issue (or social problem, social conflict, or social illness) is a issue which affects many people in a society. 

Social issues are different from economic issues. However, some issues, such as immigration, have both social and economic aspects. Racism, unemployment, poverty, violence, human rights are examples of social issues.
