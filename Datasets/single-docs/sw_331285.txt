Handicraft

Handicraft is a type of craft where people make things using only their hands or basic tools. The items are usually decorative and have a particular use. Usually the term refers to traditional methods of making things. 

The items often have cultural or religious value. Things made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods. Also, handicraft things are different from "arts and crafts" because they are meant to be used for something. Handicraft items are generally contrasted with mass production, things made on a factory production line.
