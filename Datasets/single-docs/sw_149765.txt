New Stuyahok, Alaska

New Stuyahok is a city in Alaska on the Nushagak River. In 2000 there were 471 people living in New Stuyahok. The name "Stuyahok" means "going down river place". In 2008 a new airport was built at a cost of $3,000,000.

The village of New Stuyahok has been moved at least three times. It moved down the river from the first site in 1918. In 1942 this site was seen to be still too far up the river and being flooded too often, so the village moved to its current site. A school and a post office were built in 1961.
