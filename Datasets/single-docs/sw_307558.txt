Wii U

The Wii U () is a video game console that was released by Nintendo on November 18, 2012, and is the successor of the Wii. The video game machine, or console, was first shown in Nintendo's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 on June 7, 2011, and was released for sale on November 18, 2012 in North America; November 30, 2012 in Europe and Australia; and December 8, 2012 in Japan. The machine has been described as a part of the eighth generation of video game machines.

The Wii U is Nintendo's sixth home video game machine and the first Nintendo video game machine, or console, to have 1080p HD graphics, and has a new controller with a touchscreen, which allows a player to continue playing a game by showing the game even when the television is off. Wii games will work on the Wii U, and Wii U games can be played with Wii controllers and extras, such as the Wii Remote, Wii MotionPlus, Wii Balance Board, and the Classic Controller. It also has a controller shaped like the Xbox 360 controller, for the hardcore gamers. Nintendo GameCube games or controllers do not work on the Wii U unless you use the adapter used for Super Smash Bros for Wii U. However, it only works for that game. Like on the Wii and Nintendo 3DS, players can create Miis. Some of the best-selling games for the system include Mario Kart 8, New Super Mario Bros. U, and Nintendo Land.
