Mario Party 4 is a party board video game for the Nintendo GameCube. It is the fourth game in the "Mario Party" series. It is the first "Mario Party" game for the Nintendo GameCube.

"Mario Party 4" plays the same as the first three "Mario Party" games. Players go around on boards collecting coins and stars. Along the way, they may use items to help them. Items can be bought in an item shop. After all four players go, they play a mini-game. Whoever wins the mini-game wins coins. The player who has the most stars at the end of the game wins. One new feature in this game is the Warp Space. If a player lands on this space, they must switch spaces with another player. Who the player has to switch spaces with is chosen by a wheel.

Six boards are available to play on. One of the boards must be unlocked in Story Mode. Eight characters are playable, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach.
