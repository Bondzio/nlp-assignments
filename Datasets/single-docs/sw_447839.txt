Pandoravirus

Pandoravirus is a genus of very large viruses, with the largest genomes of any viral genus. Like the other very large viruses "Mimivirus", "Pithovirus" and "Megavirus", "Pandoravirus" infects amoebas. Its genome, with 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of "Megavirus". It differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure.

Although the capsid of "Pithovirus" is 50% larger in size, "Pandoravirus" has the largest genome among all viruses.
