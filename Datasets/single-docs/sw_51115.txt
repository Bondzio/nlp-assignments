Tuareg people

The Tuareg (, sometimes spelled "Touareg" in French, or "Twareg" in English) are a Berber ethnic group. The Tuareg today lives mostly in West Africa, but they were once nomads that moved throughout the Sahara. They used their own writing known as the tifina…§.

Today most Tuaregs are Muslims. However, unlike in many other Muslim peoples, they value women a lot. Their most important leader was a woman. Tuareg men use veils, but not women. Their families are matrilinear.
