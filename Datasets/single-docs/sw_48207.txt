Borg (Star Trek)

The Borg are a fictional race of cyborgs in the Star Trek universe. The Borg use nanoprobes to assimilate others, like humans or vulcans, into their group consciousness. The Borg's group consciousness is led by the Borg queen, who's role is similar to that of a queen bee in a bee hive.
