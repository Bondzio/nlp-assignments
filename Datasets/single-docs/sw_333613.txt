Vampire Lesbians of Sodom

Vampire Lesbians of Sodom is a satirical play by Charles Busch. It is about two immortal vampire lesbians. They are locked in eternal antagonism after surviving the downfall of the Biblical city of Sodom. Both women arrive in Jazz Age Broadway and Hollywood. They pretend to be silent movie stars. They reach a truce in a final scene set in Las Vegas in the 1980s. "The New York Times" described the show as having "costumes flashier than pinball machines, outrageous lines, awful puns, sinister innocence, [and] harmless depravity". It was first performed at the Limbo Lounge in Manhattan's East Village in 1984. It moved Off Broadway in June 1985 to the Provincetown Playhouse. It had a five year run.
