DC Extended Universe

The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero movies, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, based on characters that appear in publications by DC Comics. 

The shared universe, much like the original DC Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The movies have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed four movies with more than ten in various stages of production. The series has grossed over $3 billion at the global box office, currently making it the seventeenth highest-grossing movie franchise.

The movies are written and directed by a variety of screenwriters and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Several actors, including Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, and Ray Fisher, are set to appear in numerous movies. 

In May 2016, DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg were appointed to co-run the DC Films division and oversee creative decisions, production and story-arcs in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the movies.

The first movie in the DCEU was "Man of Steel" (2013), which was followed by "" (2016), "Suicide Squad" (2016), and "Wonder Woman" (2017). Future movies include "Justice League" (2017), "Aquaman" (2018), "Shazam" (2019), "Cyborg" (2020), and "Green Lantern Corps" (2020). 

Other projects are also in many stages of development, including "Suicide Squad 2", "Wonder Woman 2", "Justice League Dark", "Flashpoint", "The Batman", "Batgirl", "Gotham City Sirens", a "Justice League" sequel, a second Superman solo movies, and untitled solo movies for Black Adam and Nightwing.
