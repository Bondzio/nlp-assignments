Road

People have been making roads for a long time. Roman roads and the Incan courier roads are famous. But transport by river was usually easier and faster than transport by road. In the industrial revolution, the railway was invented. A railway is a special type of road, using Railway tracks. Roads are now usually made for wheeled vehicles, like cars, to travel on.

Road building and care is usually paid for by taxes. Some roads are toll roads, where people pay to use the road.
