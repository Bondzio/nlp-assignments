Henri Termeer

Henri A. Termeer (28 February 1946 – 12 May 2017) was an American biotechnology executive and entrepreneur. He was called a pioneer in corporate strategy in the biotechnology industry for his tenure as CEO at Genzyme. 

Termeer created a business model created by many others in the biotech industry by creating steep prices— mainly from insurers and government payers— for therapies for rare genetic disorders known as orphan diseases that mainly affect children. Genzyme uses biological processes to manufacture drugs that are not easily copied by generic-drug makers. He was born in Tilburg, Netherlands.

Termeer died of a suspected aneurysm on 12 May 2017 at his home in Marblehead, Massachusetts, aged 71.
