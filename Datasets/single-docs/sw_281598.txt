Anthurium

Anthurium is a large plant genus of about 600- 800 (possibly 1,000) species, belonging to the arum family (Araceae). Anthurium can also be called "Flamingo Flower" or "Boy Flower", both referring to the structure of the spathe and spadix.

The species has neotropical distribution; mostly in wet tropical mountain forest of Central America and South America, but some in semi-arid environments.
