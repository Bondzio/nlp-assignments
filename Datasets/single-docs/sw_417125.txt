Lieutenant Governor of Illinois

The Lieutenant Governor of Illinois is the second highest office of the State of Illinois. As of January 12, 2015, the lieutenant governor is Evelyn Sanguinetti. 

In Illinois, the lieutenant governor and governor run on a joint ticket, and are directly elected by popular vote. Candidates for lieutenant governor run separately in the primary from candidates for governor. 

When the Governor of Illinois becomes unable to discharge the duties of that office, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor. If the Governor dies, resigns or is removed from office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Under the Illinois Constitution, the Attorney General, currently Lisa Madigan, is next in line of succession to the Governor's office after the lieutenant governor, but does not succeed to the Lieutenant Governor's office. Historically, the lieutenant governor has been from either the Democratic Party or Republican Party.
