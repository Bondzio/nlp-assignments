Military organization

A military organization is a way of making up the armed forces of a state as a need to offer military capability as needed by a national defence policy. In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces. Armed forces that are not a part of the military or paramilitary organizations, such as insurgent forces, often mimic military organizations, or use ad hoc structures.
