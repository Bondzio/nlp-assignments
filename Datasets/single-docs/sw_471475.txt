Puja (Hinduism)

Pūjā (Devanagari: पूजा) is a prayer service ritual done by Hindus. The word puja comes from Sanskrit, and means reverence, honor and worship. A puja honors one or more deities. It also spiritually celebrates an event. It is sometimes spelled phonetically as "pooja" or "poojah". A Puja is the most common form of worship in the Hindu religion. It may honor or celebrate the presence of special guests or their memories after they die. Puja rituals are also held by Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs.
