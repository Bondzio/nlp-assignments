Ambrose Burnside

Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824 â€“ September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, railroad executive and politician. He served as governor and a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. As a Union Army general in the American Civil War, he fought successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee but was defeated in the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. Burnside commanded the IX Corps, the Department of Ohio, and also the Army of the Potomac for a few months. His distinctive style of facial hair is now known as sideburns, derived from his last name.
