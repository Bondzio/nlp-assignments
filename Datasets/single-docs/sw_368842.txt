Mevlevi

The Mevlevi or Mevleviyya order, or school ("tarika") of Sufism was founded by Hazrat Sheikh "Mevlana" Jalal-ud-din Rumi. He was also sometimes known as Jalal-ud-din Balkhi as he came from Balkh, Afghanistan, and settled in Konya, (modern Turkey). This order is also called the 'Order of the Whirling Dervishes' because of the famous "sema" whirling/dancing ritual that they practice.
