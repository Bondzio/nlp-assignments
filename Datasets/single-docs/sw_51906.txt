The name is from the French word "puce" which means "flea". Some people say that the colour name comes from the colour of a squashed flea or the colour of a flea full of blood. Other people say that colour name comes from the flea's droppings of digested blood, which spread out in deep red stain when water contacts them. Still others say that the colour name means the colour of the belly of a flea. 

On the other hand, the colour name may refer to blue-lavender of the Pennyroyal flower, also named "puce" in French. The name may come from the use of strong-smelling Pennyroyal to ward off fleas.
