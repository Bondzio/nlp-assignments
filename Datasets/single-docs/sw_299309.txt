Rhodesia at the Olympics

Rhodesia at the Olympics is a history which began in 1928. 

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Rhodesia is RHO.

A team from Rhodesia was first in the Olympic Games in 1928. They were also at the 1960 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Olympics. The country always competed as a British territory. It was unable to be in the 1968 Games in Mexico. 

Following Ian Smith's declaration of an independent Rhodesian republic in 1970, they never competed again. In 1972 Rhodesia was expelled by the International Olympic Committee four days before the opening ceremony. This was due to pressure from other African countries, which did not recognise the legitimacy of the Rhodesian state. The country's successor state, Zimbabwe, made its Olympic d√©but in 1980.

Rhodesia was never in the Winter Olympics. No Rhodesian athlete ever won an Olympic medal.
