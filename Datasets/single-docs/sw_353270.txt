1,112 and Counting

1,112 and Counting is an essay that was written by novelist and playwright Larry Kramer in 1983. It was published in the "New York Native". The newspaper is a gay daily newspaper for the LGBT community. It was believed to be the first essay to be written about the AIDS crisis. The essay begins with the HIV death toll at the time. Many homosexuals did not like the essay. This was because the essay blamed them for the widespread of the disease. Many others did not like it because Kramer was a known self-hating gay man. This was because of his novel "Faggots" which gave negative views on causal and anonymous sex.

The essay helped influence much of queer writing. It also helped Kramer's reputation as an gay rights advocate.
