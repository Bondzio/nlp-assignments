Tampa Bay Rays

The Tampa Bay Rays are a Major League Baseball team that plays in St. Petersburg, Florida. From the team being started in 1998 until November 2007, it was known as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Their home stadium is Tropicana Field.

The Rays played their first game on March 31, 1998 against the Detroit Tigers (as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays), which they lost 11-6. They were one of the least successful teams in the Major Leagues until 2008, when they finished in first place in the American League East and had one of the best records in baseball. They made it to the World Series but were beaten by Philadelphia in five games. Evan Longoria brought the team's first AL Rookie of the Year award to the team on November 10, 2008.

On November 8, 2007, the team changed its name to Tampa Bay Rays.

The Rays have rivalries with two teams. The Boston Red Sox is one due to the 2008 American League Championship Series, the other is the Florida Marlins due their in-state location. When the Rays and Marlins meet during inter-league play (when the American League (Rays) and National League (Marlins) play each other) it is known as the "Citrus Series".
