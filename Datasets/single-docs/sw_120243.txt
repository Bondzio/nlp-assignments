Harpo Marx

Arthur Marx (previously Adolph Marx), also called Harpo Marx (November 23, 1888 â€“ September 28, 1964), was one of the Marx Brothers. While acting, he did not speak, and only used horns, whistles, and other props. He taught himself to play the harp and became a good player. This is why he was nicknamed "Harpo". He played the harp in most of his movies and also wore a red wig.

He died after a heart attack.
