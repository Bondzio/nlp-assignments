2001 anthrax attacks

The 2001 Anthrax attacks were a series of incidents in the United States. The attacks began on Tuesday, September 18, 2001 and lasted for several weeks. Anthrax was spread through the mail. The anthrax spores were put in envelopes and sent to several news media offices and two U.S. senate offices.
22 people were infected. Five people died. It was believed that the person who was responsible for this was Dr. Bruce Ivins. He was a senior biodefense researcher who was actually employed by the U.S. government Ivins killed himself in 2008. He was never found guilty of the crime but the evidence suggests that he acted alone in mailing the envelopes.
