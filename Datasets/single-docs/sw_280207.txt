Mirror's Edge

Mirror's Edge is a single-player first person action-adventure video game made by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

The plot of Mirror's Edge follows Faith, a member of a group called the Runners. The Runners deliver things from person to person as an underground system, as the city spies on the citizens a lot. Faith's sister is accused of killing a candidate for mayor of the city, and Faith finds out it's part of a plan to kill the Runners. The true killer ends up being an ex-Runner gone rogue working for the government, and Faith saves her sister from being arrested.
