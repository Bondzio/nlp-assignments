Talking Heads

Talking Heads was a rock band from the United States from the late 1970s. 
The band had an early influence on other musical groups by combining the sounds of punk, art rock, funk, dance and world music with an avant-garde style and the anxious way David Byrne sang on stage.

Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said Talking Heads was "one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s." 

In 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 

Four of the band's albums appeared on "Rolling Stone's" list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Three of their songs ("Psycho Killer," "Life During Wartime," and "Once in a Lifetime") were listed in "The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". Talking Heads were also included at #64 on VH1's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time." In the 2011 update of "Rolling Stone's" "100 Greatest Artists of All Time," the band was ranked at No.Â 100.
