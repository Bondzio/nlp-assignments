Poughkeepsie Bridge

The Poughkeepsie Bridge (sometimes known as the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge or the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge) is a cantilever bridge over the Hudson River. It goes from Poughkeepsie, New York on the east side to Highland, New York on the west side. It was built for trains and was completed on January 1, 1889. It closed down on May 8, 1974 after a bad fire. It became part of the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. On October 3, 2009, the bridge was opened to the public as a pedestrian bridge and New York State Park. It is now known as the Walkway Over the Hudson. It cost $39 million to improve it.
