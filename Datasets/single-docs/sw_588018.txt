Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma

Patricia Edwina Victoria Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma (14 February 1924 â€“ 13 June 2017) was a British peeress and the third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. She was the elder daughter of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma and his wife, the heiress Edwina Ashley, a patrilineal descendant of the Earls of Shaftesbury, first ennobled in 1661. 

Knatchbull was the elder sister of Lady Pamela Hicks, and first cousin to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and the last surviving baptismal sponsor to Prince Charles, Prince of Wales.

Mountbatten succeeded her father when he was assassinated in 1979, as his peerages had been created by the Crown with special remainder to his daughters and their heirs male. This inheritance accorded her the title of "countess" and a seat in the House of Lords, where she remained until 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed most hereditary peers from the House.

Knatchbull died on 13 June 2017 in Kent, England at the age of 93.
