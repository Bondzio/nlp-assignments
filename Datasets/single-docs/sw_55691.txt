God the Father

In many religions, the deity or God is called the Father.

In Christianity, God the Father is the first person of the Trinity. He "is" God, just like the Son and the Holy Spirit, but as a "person" He is "different" from the Son and the Holy Spirit. Although Jesus had St. Joseph for his human father on earth, Jesus is God, so His father would actually be God the Father.
