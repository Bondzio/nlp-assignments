Pico Ruivo

Pico Ruivo ("red peak" in Portuguese) is, with its , the highest point of the island of Madeira and the third summit of Portugal (after Mount Pico in Pico Island, Azores, and Torre in continental Portugal).

Pico Ruivo is in the Central Mountainous Massif, in the municipality of Santana, where there are also other high mountains like the "Pico das Torres", with and the "Pico do Arieiro", with .

Although of moderate altitude, the top has a very rocky landscape. The only vegetation that can develop there is of plants that grow on or among rocks.

There are two main types of vegetation: one with heathers, widespread on the island, and another with few herbaceous plants. A special feature for this altitude is the presence of small shrubs and heather trees.

Some birds found on Pico Ruivo are the common blackbird, chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. The red-legged partridge and the common linnet also nest on Pico Ruivo.

Until a few years ago, its slopes were used for raising goats, sheep and cows. However, to conserve the biodiversity in the region (such as the protection of the bird "freira-da-madeira" and plant communities in altitude), this practice was prohibited and the entire area around the peak is recovering.

The summit of Pico Ruivo can be reached only on foot:
