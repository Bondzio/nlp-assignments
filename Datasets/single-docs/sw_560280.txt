Trident

A trident is a three-pronged spear. It is used for spearfishing. Historically it was used as a polearm. Gladiators used them in Ancient Rome after they cast a net to trap their opponent. The trident is the weapon of Poseidon, or Neptune, the god of the sea in classical mythology. In Hindu mythology it is the weapon of Shiva, known as "trishula" (Sanskrit for "triple-spear"). The word "trident" comes from the French word "trident", which in turn comes from the Latin word "tridens".
