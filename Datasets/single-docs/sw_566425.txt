Gofred abo Jeruzalem wyzwolona

Gofred abo Jeruzalem wyzwolona is a Polish translation of Torquato Tasso's "Gerusalemme liberata" ("Jerusalem Delivered") (by Piotr Kochanowski. It was first printed in Cracow (Krak√≥w) in 1618. 

In 16th century Polish literature flourished. One thing, however, lacked. There was no long epic poem in Poland. Jan Kochanowski, the greatest poet of the Renaissance in Kingdom of Poland, wrote many lyrical pieces and some stories in verse. His nephew, Piotr Kochanowski was the first poet to give an epic poem to the Poles. He did not write a poem on his own. He translated two epic masterpieces from the Italian. They were "Jerusalem Delivered" by Torquato Tasso and "Orlando Furioso" by Ludovico Ariosto. 

The historical importance of Piotr Kochanowski's translation lies in its form. The poet used exactly the same form, ottava rima. It is an Italian strophe of eight lines. It is built of 11-syllable lines (endecasillabo in Italian). It rhymes abababcc. The strophe was used by Italian poets from 14th century. There are many long poems in ottava rima in Italian literature of 15th and 16th centuries. There were not any in Polish literature of the time. Piotr Kochanowski introduced the strophe into Polish poetry. There was another poet, Sebastian Grabowiecki, who used it earlier in Poland. He dit it, however, in one short poem. Into English poetry ottava rima was introduced many years before by Thomas Wyatt. In 17th century ottava rima became one of the most important verse forms in Poland.

Piotr Kochanowski's version of "Jerusalem Delivered" is still widely read. There are many new editions. His translation is used at school.
