The New Girl in Town

The New Girl in Town is the second released album by Selena Y Los Dinos. The album has ten tracks. Some of them were covers of songs performed by other artists before Selena. The rest were written by Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.

When Selena and her band did not receive much support from Freddie Martinez, the founder of Freddie Records, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, the father of Selena, began searching for another record label for the band. In the summer of 1984, "Cara Records" contacted him who had heard Selena during a recent concert and so they can sign "Selena y Los Dinos". Selena began to record tracks for her new album "The New Girl In Town" in late 1984. Cara Records released the album in 1985, but had to withdraw it after only two months due to conflicts with various song rights. Quintanilla then moved the band to the Manny Guerra labels GP Productions and RP Productions/Record Producer from 1985â€“1989, and finally to EMI in 1989. The song "Oh Mama" on Cara Records became very popular leading to appearances by Selena y Los Dinos on television shows like the "Johnny Canales Show".
