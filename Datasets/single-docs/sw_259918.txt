Fuckin' in the Bushes

"Fuckin' in the Bushes" is the first track on British band Oasis' fourth studio album, "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants".

The song was frequently used as the first song in Oasis' concerts, such as on their "Don't Believe the Truth" Tour, played on a tape. It contains samples taken from Murray Lerner's movie "Message to Love - Isle of Wight 1970". It is featured during the climactic scene of the movie "Snatch," and it was played when Oasis received their award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

Professional wrestler Nigel McGuinness used the song as his entrance theme.

Bowling for Soup have used the song as an intro on the UK leg of their Get Happy Tour.

It is used on the ITV television program James Corden's World Cup Live.
