PROTECT IP Act

The Protect Intellectual Property Act (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act), also called PIPA, is a proposed American law to stop copyright infringement on the Internet.

There are critics who point out that the proposed law has hidden risks and consequences which are unplanned.

Some people and businesses support the law while others are alarmed by the law. Supporters worry that the current copyright law is not effective in shutting down piracy websites. Opponents worry that the law is a kind of censorship. It is hard to tell which side is correct because the language in the law is still being written.
