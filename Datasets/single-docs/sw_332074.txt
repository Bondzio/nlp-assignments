Floodplain

A Flood plain or Floodplain is a plain or nearly flat land surface close to the bed of a river or stream. If there is little water in the river, the plain will be dry. If there is a lot of water, the surplus water will flood this area. Floodplains provide habitats for many plants and animals.
