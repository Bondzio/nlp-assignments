Line of succession to the Dutch throne

The line of succession to the Dutch throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of the Netherlands.

Since 1983, Dutch law identifies the eldest child of a Dutch monarch as the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.
