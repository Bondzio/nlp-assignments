Moldovan language

Moldovan () is the official language of the Republic of Moldova. It is the same as the Romanian language. The main difference is that Moldovan was written in Cyrillic alphabet, because the Moldavian SSR was part of the Soviet Union until 1989. In 1989 Moldova became its own country and they started to use the Latin alphabet just like in Romania. On the 5th of December 2013 the Moldovan government chose the Romanian language as the official one.

In the unrecognized state of Transnistria, one of the official languages is still Moldovan, along with Russian and Ukrainian. But here it is still written with the Cyrillic alphabet.
