Paraffin

In chemistry, paraffin is the common name for the alkane hydrocarbons with the general formula CH. Paraffin wax refers to the solids with n between 20 and 40, inclusive.

The simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane, CH, a gas at room temperature. Heavier members of the series, such as that of octane, CH, and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature. The solid forms of paraffin, called "paraffin wax", are from the heaviest molecules from CH to CH. Paraffin wax was identified by Carl Reichenbach in 1830.

Paraffin, or "paraffin hydrocarbon", is also the technical name for an alkane in general, but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear, or "normal" alkane â€” whereas branched, or "iso"alkanes are also called "iso"paraffins. It is distinct from the fuel known in Ireland, Britain and South Africa as "paraffin oil" or just "paraffin", which is called kerosene in most of the U.S., Australia and New Zealand.

The name is derived from the Latin "parum" (= barely) + "affinis" with the meaning here of "lacking affinity", or "lacking reactivity". This is because alkanes, being non-polar and lacking in functional groups, are very unreactive.
