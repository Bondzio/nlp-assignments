Metaphilosophy

Metaphilosophy is the study of the nature of philosophy. Philosophy is the study of ideas connected with existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Metaphilosophy investigates the aims, boundaries, and methods of philosophy. Metaphilosophers ask the question, "What is philosophy?" and seek to understand what its purpose is.
