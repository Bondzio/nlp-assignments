There have been other specials in which feature-length movies were broadcast on television rather than in theaters.

The special crossover episode "Kamen Rider Den-O + Shin-O" aired in 2007 to promote the "Kamen Rider Den-O" movie. A second special series was aired in April 2012 featuring Shin-chan and "Kamen Rider Fourze" to not only promote "Crayon Shin-chan: The Storm Called!: Me and the Space Princess", but also "".
