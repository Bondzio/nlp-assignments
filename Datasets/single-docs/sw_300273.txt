Nair

Nair, also known as Nayar, is a Hindu caste of the Indian state of Kerala on the Malabar Coast.

According to some theories, the Nair have Indo-Scythian ancestry. Traditionally, Kerala's royalty, militia, and land managers were from the Nair and related castes. During British rule, Nair were known as Nayarkutti and were important in politics, government, medicine, education, and law.
