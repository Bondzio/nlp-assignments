Volvo

Volvo is a Swedish car and truck maker founded in 1927.

Ford bought the "Volvo" car company in 1999. In 2010 Geely bought the Volvo Car Company.

Today there are two companies. 1: Volvo Cars that produces standard size cars. 2: Volvo Group that produces trucks, boat engines, buses and more. 

Volvo is now the leading producer in what most people would call safe family cars. 

One of the Volvo's cars, the Volvo S60 is used by police departments in some parts of Europe and the United Kingdom.

In March 2010, Ford signed a deal to sell Volvo to Chinese car maker Geely for $1.8 billion.
