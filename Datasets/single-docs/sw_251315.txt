Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden

Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, also known as Sophia Karlovna Buxhoeveden (Russian: София Карловна Буксгевден, September 6, 1883 – November 26, 1956), was a lady in waiting to Tsarina Alexandra of Russia. She wrote three memoirs about the imperial family and about her own escape from Russia. In her book "Before the Storm", Sophie describes a side of old Russia seldom seen elsewhere, a family in the old fashioned provincial country life of the gentry in the years before the revolution. When she saw the famous imposter, Anna Anderson, who was at first claiming to be Grand Duchess Tatiana, she did not believe her. She called her "too short" to be Tatiana. When Anderson later claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the Baroness said that Anderson "does not physically resemble her in the least".
