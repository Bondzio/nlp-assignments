Elections in Azerbaijan

Elections are held in Azerbaijan to elect the head of state (the president) and a legislature (the parliament).

The President of Azerbaijan is elected for a five-year term by the people; before a referendum by the people changed this in 2009, the position was limited to two terms.

The parliament of Azerbaijan, the National Assembly ("Milli MÉ™clis"), has 125 members. Before 2005, 100 members were elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies and 25 members were elected by proportional representation. Since 2005 all 125 members are elected in single-seat constituencies. 

Azerbaijan is a one party dominant state. Opposition political parties beside the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power.

On Sunday, 1 November 2015, the most recent parliamentary elections were held. On Wednesday, 9 October 2013, the most recent presidential election was held.
