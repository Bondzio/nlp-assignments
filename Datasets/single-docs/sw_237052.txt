Lord Mayor

The Lord Mayor is the title of the Mayor of a major city, with special recognition.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is a ceremonial position. This means the person is not in charge of the day to day work of the city, but represents the city at important events. These positions are given to a person by letters patent, which are a special letter from the monarch.
