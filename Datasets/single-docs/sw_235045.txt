United States presidential election, 1964

This 1964 election was between Democrat Lyndon Johnson (President of the United States) and Republican Barry Goldwater (Senator of Arizona).

During 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon Johnson (his vice president) became president of the United States.

Lyndon Johnson campaigned to continue many of Kennedy's policies and ideas such as civil rights. He supported a series of programs called the "Great Society" to improve the quality of living for poor people which included programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and environmental programs.

Barry Goldwater had the opposite belief that the government should be smaller and he was against government programs. During his campaign, actor Ronald Reagan made a famous speech called "Time For A Choosing" in support of Goldwater. Goldwater during the campaign was portrayed as an extremist who condoned the actions of the KKK and would cause nuclear war. His beliefs were radical at the time, but they would later influence many libertarian and conservative politicians.

Lyndon Johnson won the election by a landslide (meaning he received a lot more votes than his opponent).
