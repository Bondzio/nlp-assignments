Badbaado (refugee camp)

Badbaado is a refugee camp outside of Mogadishu, Somalia. It began as a result of the 2011 East Africa drought and famine. It now houses roughly 30,000 refugees.

Food aid is available for refugees there, but its supply has been poor because of the policies of al-Shabab. The limited access to food has been a source of violence in the camp. There has also been looting by freelance militias and government forces. Due to the unsafe conditions, some refugees have fled Badbaado to seek other camps.
