Revenue

Revenue (or revenues) is income that an organization receives from its normal business activities. In the case of a corporation this is usually from the sale of goods and services to customers. In the case of a government, revenue usually comes from various taxes. It does not include the cost required to create these goods and services, which is considered "profit". In addition to sale of goods and services, some companies also receive revenue from interest, dividends or royalties paid to them by other companies.
