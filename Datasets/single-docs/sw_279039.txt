International Species Information System

The International Species Information System (ISIS) is an international non-profit organization that helps zoos and aquariums around the world. ISIS gives its members software to collect and share information about animals. The ISIS database has information on 2.4 million animals of 10,000 species. ISIS members use basic information (age, sex, parents, place of birth, reports of deaths, etc.) collected in the ISIS system to care for and manage their animals.
