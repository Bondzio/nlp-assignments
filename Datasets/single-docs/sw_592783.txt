Next United Kingdom general election

The Next United Kingdom general election is due to take place on the 5 May 2022. It will elect the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom.

In 2017 the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May called for an early election. Most of the opinion polls said the Conservative Party would win a big majority. However, the election ended with a hung parliament with the Conservatives losing seats and the Labour Party gaining seats.

The election is not due to take place until 5 May 2022 but because there is a hung parliament some people think the government will be forced to call another election before then if it can't pass any new laws or loses a No Confidence vote.
