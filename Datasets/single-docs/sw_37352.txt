Bowser (character)

Bowser is a video game character. He is the evil Koopa that takes over the Mushroom Kingdom. He is a devil version of a normal Koopa. He was ranked #1 in the Top 50 Video Game Villains of all time list by the "Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2013".

Bowser's first appearance was in "Super Mario Bros." as a final boss. The first seven castles had Bowsers, but they are fake. Only the eighth Bowser is real. 

Bowser's kids, called the Koopalings, were bosses in "Super Mario Bros. 3", "Super Mario World", "New Super Mario Bros. Wii", "New Super Mario Bros. 2", and "New Super Mario Bros. U". In "Super Mario World", he appears in a clown car and throws Mecha Koopas. 

When Mario moved to the Nintendo 64 with "Super Mario 64", Bowser returned as the main villain. In the remake of this game, Super Mario 64 DS, he is fought as a boss three times. 

He also appears in the Disney movie "Wreck-It Ralph".
