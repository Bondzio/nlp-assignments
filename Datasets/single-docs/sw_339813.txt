Scientific revolution

The scientific revolution was a time (1550-1700) following the Middle Ages and the Renaissance when many discoveries were made. During this time, new ideas and discoveries fundamentally changed the way people thought; they also forced people to think differently, and started what is called science today. This period roughly lasted from the 16th to the 18th century. 

The era was jump-started by Galileo Galilei when he disproved Aristotle with his new theory of gravity. One of his students said he dropped two balls of iron (one weighing one pound, the other a hundred) off the leaning tower of Pisa. The objects fell at the same rate which brought about new methods of thinking in that time period. In 1542, Nicolaus Copernicus published his work "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres", in which he said that not the earth, but the sun was at the center of the universe. This theory is known as Heliocentrism today. In the same year, Andreas Vesalius pubilshed his work "On the Structure of the Human Body". This book is about the anatomy of the human body.

The philosopher Alexandre Koyr√© (18921964) first used the term 'scientific revolution' for this time period.
