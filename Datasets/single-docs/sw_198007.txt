List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions

The Formula One World Constructors' Championship (WCC) is awarded the most successful constructor of the year. The award is given by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to the constructor scoreing the most points during a season. The Constructors' Championship was first awarded in 1958, to Vanwall.

For the purposes of the Championship, different combinations of car makes and engines are different constructors . Constructors' Championship points are awarded by adding the points scored in each race by all the drivers for that constructor. For most seasons up until 1979, a constructor was awarded only the points from the highest-scoring driver in each race. 

In the 51 seasons the Championship has been awarded, only 13 different constructors have won it. Scuderia Ferrari has been the most successful with 16 titles. Only ten times has the World Drivers' Champion come from a team that did not win the World Constructors' Champion the same year.
