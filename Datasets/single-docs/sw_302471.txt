In the Edo period, "Ishiyakushi-juku" and "Shōno-juku" were 44th and 45th of the 53 shogunate-maintained waystations ("shuku-eki") along the Tōkaidō road which connected Edo and Kyoto. Both Tōkaidō rest stops are within the boundaries of modern Suzuka.

In December 1942, two towns and twelve villages were merged to form Suzuka. It was a military administered city, and had a population of 52,000. After World War II, many automotive companies and other industries moved into Suzuka.

Suzuka is by the Suzuka Quasi National Park (the boundary between Suzuka and Shiga). Since the industrial boom, it has been a interchange point for the main commuter train lines. With the mix of commuters passing through Suzuka city, the local dialect ("hōgen") is a mixture of three, variations of Japanese. 

Suzuka has a significant industrial base. It has large factories for both Sharp and Honda. 

Suzuka Circuit was the home of the Japanese Grand Prix from 1987 to 2006. 

The Grand Prix returned in 2009 and the racing continues through the present. 

It was the only figure-of-eight circuit in the championship, and is very popular with the drivers. 

Next to the circuit is the Honda Safety Riding/Driving School. Thousands of car and motorcycle drivers have been trained at the school. Graduates include many police officers and instructors throughout the world.
