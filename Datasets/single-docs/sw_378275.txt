Goki calendar

, also known as "Wuji li", was a Japanese lunisolar calendar ("genka reki"). It was developed in China; and it was used in Japan in the mid-9th century.

The "Goki-reki" system corrected errors in the Taien calendar which was used in Japan in the first half of the 9th century. The corrections were the work of Akasuga Manomaro.
