Brigantes

The Brigantes were a British Celtic tribe (people), that used to live in the North of Roman Britain; between the rivers Tyne and Humber. They occupied what was later Northumbria.

The tribes that used to live next to the Brigantes were the Carvetti, the Parisii, the Cornovii, and the Corieltauvi.

There was a Brigantes tribe who used to live in the South of Ireland as well. They may both be related to the "Brigantii" of the eastern Alps.
