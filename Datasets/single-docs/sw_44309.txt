Consecutive integer

Consecutive integers are integers that follow each other in order. They have a difference of 1 between every two numbers. In a set of consecutive integers, the mean and the median are equal. 

If "n" is an integer, then "n", "n"+1, and "n"+2 would be consecutive integers.


1, 2, 3, 4, 5

−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2 , 3 , 4

6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Odd consecutive integers are odd integers that follow each other. They have a difference of 2 between every two numbers.

If "n" is an odd integer, then "n," "n"+2, "n"+4, and "n"+6 will be odd consecutive integers.

the first number in the pattern is always the variable on its own or in this case, "n". 
Examples

3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, etc.
