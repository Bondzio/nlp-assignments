Shōchū

Shōchū is a Japanese alcoholic drink. It is usually around 25% alcohol. Shōchū is made often from barley, rice, or sweet potato. It is made many places in Japan, but started in Kyūshū. People drink it mixed with water, over ice, in cocktails, or straight. Shōchū is different from "nihonshu", or sake.
