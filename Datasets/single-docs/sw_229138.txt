Cherry cake

A cherry cake is a soft, creamy cake with firm bread and ripe cherries inside it. It is served with cherry icing, made of icing sugar, butter, and water. Sometimes pink food coloring is added to the icing, to make it look like it is made of cherries.

Cherry cakes may also be presented with sprinkled icing, and desiccated coconut.
