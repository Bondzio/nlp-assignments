Benoîte Groult

Benoîte Groult (January 31, 1920, in Paris – June 20, 2016 in Hyères) was a French journalist, writer and feminist activist.

Her novel "Les vaisseaux du cœur", published in 1988, was called pornographic by some because of its explicit sexual depictions. It was filmed by Andrew Birkin in 1992 as "Salt on Our Skin".

In April 2010, she became Commander of the Légion d'honneur.
