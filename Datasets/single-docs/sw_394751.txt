Lot

Lot was the nephew of Abraham in the Book of Genesis, chapters 11-19. He moves to Sodom and Gomorrah. He leaves quickly when angels warn him of the coming destruction of the cities, but his wife looks back 'and she became a pillar of salt' (Genesis 19:26) He fathers children with his daughters when they get him drunk. They gave birth to Moab and Ammon.
