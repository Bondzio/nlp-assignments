Antiprism

In geometry an antiprism is a polyhedron. It is made of two copies of a regular polygon. These polygons are connected using an alternating band of triangles. To connect an n-sided polygon, 2n triangles are needed. Antiprisms are similar to prisms, but prisms use parallelograms for the bands at the side.

A right antiprism uses a right angle to connect the base polygons to the band of triangles. A uniform antiprism uses equilateral triangles as base surfaces.
