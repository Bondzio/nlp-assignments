Heckler &amp; Koch G3

The Heckler & Koch G3 is a rifle developed by Heckler & Koch and the Spanish state-owned design and development agency CETME. It has a 20 rounds magazine, that holds 7.62mm NATO ammunition.

It was invented in the 1950s, and was the main weapon of the German army (Bundeswehr). Now the main weapon is the G36. Many German soldiers want the old G3 back. The G3 is still in service as a sniper rifle, but they changed to the G28 for "designated marksmen".
