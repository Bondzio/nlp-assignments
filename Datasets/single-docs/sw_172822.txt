Concert of Europe

The Concert of Europe was a group of countries in Europe who worked together and agreed on policies to maintain a steady balance of power which included alliances between the great powers in 1814 and 1914.

The member countries were the United Kingdom, Austria, Russia and Prussia (the predecessor to modern Germany). After Napoleon, ruler of France, was no longer in power, France joined the Concert of Europe. Its importance diminished after the Crimean War in 1853 when Britain and France declared war on Russia, although they were supposed to cooperate to solve disputes.
