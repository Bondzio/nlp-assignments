UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements

The UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements describes the wheel arrangement of locomotives, multiple units and trams. It is set out in the International Union of Railways (UIC) "Leaflet 650 - Standard designation of axle arrangement on locomotives and multiple-unit sets". It is used in much of the world. The United Kingdom used a related scheme. The United States uses the simplified AAR wheel arrangement for modern locomotives.
