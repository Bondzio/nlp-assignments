Kara Zor-El was sent to Earth from her planet Kyrpton that was about to explode at age of 13 years old by her parents Alura and Zor-El. Alura gave her instructions to protect her baby cousin Kal-El (Superman) who had been sent previously to Earth as well, and told her that due to the Earth yellow's sun, she will obtain extraordinary powers.

Kara's spacecraft was hit by a wave of the Krypton explosion and was taken off course to the Phantom Zone, a region in space where time doesn't pass. She stayed there for 24 years, and when the spacecraft escaped for the Phantom Zone and arrived at Earth, she still looked like a 13-year-old girl. Her cousin, Kal-El, had grown up and became Superman. Superman took Kara to be adopted by his friends, the Danvers family. The series begins eleven years old later when the now 24-year-old Kara is learning to use her powers after previously hiding them, while at the same working as a normal person.
