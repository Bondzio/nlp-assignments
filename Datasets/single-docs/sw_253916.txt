International Friendship Day

International Friendship Day celebrations take place on the first Sunday of August every year. On this day, people spend time with their friends and express love for them. The exchange of Friendship Day gifts like flowers, cards, and wrist bands is a popular tradition of this occasion.

In 1935, the United States Congress proclaimed the 1st Sunday of August as National Friendship Day. Since then, celebration of National Friendship Day became an annual event.

Many other countries around the world adopted the tradition of dedicating a day to friends. In 1997, the United Nations named Winnie the Pooh as the world's Ambassador of Friendship. Today, Friendship Day is enthusiastically celebrated by many nations.

Many friends wish each other with exchange of gifts and cards on this day. "Friendship bands" are very popular in India, Nepal and parts of South America. Members of social networking sites celebrate Friendship Day on-line.

You do not have to buy a gift or spend money to enjoy Friendship Day. This avoids accusations the fun is only a "marketing gimmick".
