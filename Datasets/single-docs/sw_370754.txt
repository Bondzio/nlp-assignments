Honda Ridgeline

Honda Ridgeline is a mid sized pickup truck produced by Honda. The first model year for this truck was 2006; it has undergone several changes in design since being introduced. Unlike a traditional body-on-frame truck, the Ridgeline uses a closed box unibody frame similar to the one used on the Accord, Pilot and Odyssey. Despite good sales Honda pulled the truck in 2015, but has planned to redesign it for the 2017 model year.
