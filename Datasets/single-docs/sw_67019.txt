Vascular tissue

Vascular tissue is a complex tissue found in vascular plants. Complex means that it is composed of more than one cell type.

The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There is a meristem associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.
