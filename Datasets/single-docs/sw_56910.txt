International Baccalaureate

The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, or IBDP, is a well-known and difficult school program. It is taught in English, French or Spanish in more than 140 countries.

Students earn an IB Diploma after passing exams and completing the program requirements. They have to take classes in 6 subject areas. This is more than most countries.

The six subject areas are: Language 1 (first language), Language 2 (second language), Math, Science, World Studies, and Electives. History, Literature, Geography, and Economics are all World Studies subjects.

Students also have to write a long paper called an 'Extended Essay' and take a philosophy class called 'Theory of Knowledge'.

IBDP is famous as a difficult school program because the program has many subjects. Students have to do to 3 Higher Level subjects and 3 Standard Level subjects. Higher Level subjects are longer and more complex.

IB is studied in most countries, but some schools study the IB differently.
