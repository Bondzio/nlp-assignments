Yukata

The Yukata is a kind of kimono.

It is difficult to wear the official kimonos because they have many parts, and many Japanese people
can not put them on by themselves. Therefore most Japanese havenâ€™t needed to wear official kimonos recently.

But, it is easy to wear the yukata, because it basically consists of only one piece and an obi. In addition, the yukata is cheap, cool and easy to dry, and comfortable. Therefore yukata are perfect for summer. For example, many young women wear the yukata and geta at summer festivals, fireworks displays, and Bon festival dances.

Recently, yukata have been adopted as summer uniforms in some of the restaurants and theme parks in Japan. The sumo wrestler wears a yukata in his daily life. In addition, facility yukata are prepared as night clothes in many Japanese hotels.
