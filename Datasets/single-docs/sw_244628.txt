Huaso

A huaso (feminine huasa, but most commonly china) is a Chilean countryman and skilled horseman, very similar to the gauchos, cowboys, vaqueros and charros. Huasos are found in central and southern Chile. 

Huasos are an important part of the culture of Chile, and are a vital part of parades, parties, and holidays. The Region of O'Higgins is the place where are found the most of the Chilean huasos.
