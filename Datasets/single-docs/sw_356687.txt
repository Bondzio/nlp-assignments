Haitian Creole

Haitian Creole is a type of Creole language spoken by 13 million people in Haiti and as well as outside of Haiti.

The Haitian Creole was made by contact between French speakers and the speakers of African languages in Haiti. They needed a way to talk to each other, and formed a mixture of languages. The African influence in Haitian Creole can easily be heard in the sound, syntax, and some words. People who speak French or the African languages would have a hard time understanding the Haitian Creole language.
