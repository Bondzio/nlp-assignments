Main-Franconian

Main-Franconian is group of German dialects that are spoken in the centre of Germany, in the area known as Franconia near the river Main.

In Germany most people call these dialects simply “Fränkisch”. Although they have a lot in common there are many variations from one small region to another.

Historically Franconia (German: “Franken”) was a very large area covering a lot of Germany including parts of the Rhine as far as the Netherlands. Today Franconia is the north part of Bavaria (German: “Bayern”) including what is known as Lower Franconia, Upper Franconia, Mid-Franconia and parts of Upper Bavaria.

Typical for Franconian dialects is the voiceless consonants becoming voiced, i.e. “k” pronounced like “g”, “t” like “d”, “p” like “b” and “s” like English “z”. In pubs one often hears on the public address system a request for a member of staff
