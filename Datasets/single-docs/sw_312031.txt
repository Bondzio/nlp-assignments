Indo-Pakistani War of 1965

The Indo-Pakistani Fight of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of India. This conflict became known as the Second Kashmir War fought by India and Pakistan over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, the first having been fought in 1947. The war began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against illegal rule by India. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.
