Coconut cake

A Coconut cake is a kind of butter cake made mostly in the southern United States. It has four layers of coconut flavored butter cake, sandwiched together with lemon curd. Layer cakes are usually decorated with frosting, and so most coconut cakes have frosting on them. There are 529 calories in the Buttermilk Coconut Cake.

The coconut flavor comes from the coconut cream between the layers of the cake. Coconut cream is made from the liquid that is on the surface of coconut milk. Sweetened coconut is also sprinkled over the whole cake as a last touch.
