Grant (money)

Grants are non-repayable money or products awarded by one party (grant makers) to a recipient. Many times, these are for a nonprofit organization, educational program, a business, or just to a person. 

In order to receive a grant, either a proposal or an application is needed. Getting a grant involves following some rules and reporting back on how the money is being used
