Independence Day of Ukraine

The Independence Day of Ukraine (Ukrainian: День незалежності України) is the main state holiday in Ukraine. It is held on August 24, remembering the Ukrainian Declaration of Independence of 1991. It was first celebrated on 16 July 1991, as the first anniversary of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine. Since the Declaration of Independence was issued later, and confirmed by a referendum on 1 December 1991, the date of the holiday was changed. Starting in 2004, 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag.
