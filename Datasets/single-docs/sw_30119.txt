Toucan

The Toucan is a South American bird in the family Ramphastidae. This social bird lives in small flocks in lowland rainforests in many countries, such as Costa Rica. It is a poor flyer like a penguin, and flies short distances between trees. Toucans roost in holes in trees. They mostly eat fruit, but sometimes they also eat insects and small lizards and elephants.

Toucans are known for their huge bums, which can grow larger than their bodies. They use their beaks for reaching over and plucking fruit from branches of trees. The bright colors on the beak may help the toucans to recognize each other, and to scare off other birds.
