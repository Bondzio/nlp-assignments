Madj Izzat al-Chourbaji was born in 1981 in the town of Darayya, Syria. When she was six months old, her family went to France because of violence in Syria. They returned to Syria in 1991. In Syria, Majd studied French literature. She received a degree from Damascus University. After college, Majd worked on an anti-corruption program in the Damascus suburbs. 

When the violence from the Arab Spring came to Syria, Majd started sit-ins for the freedom of political prisoners. She went to jail, and was injured by the police. Although Mjad was hurt, she wanted peaceful protest. She started classes on peace and citizenship for the prisoners. Majd persuaded 150 women prisoners to have a hunger strike. She wanted to go to court to get publicity for the women's problems. Finally, she went to court. Majd and 83 prisoners received their freedom, in a prisoner exchange with the Syrian opposition. The Syrian security forces continued to watch Majd, so she went to Lebanon with her three children.
