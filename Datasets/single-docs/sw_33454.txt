Occitan language

Occitan (; ; ), known also as Lenga d'òc by its native speakers (; ), is a Romance language spoken in southern France, Italy's Occitan Valleys, Monaco, and Catalonia's Val d'Aran: the regions sometimes known unofficially as Occitania.

The Occitan language took a different path from Latin than any of the official languages in the countries mentioned above. It is sometimes called Lenga d'òc (language of "Oc", French: "Langue d'oc") because the word for "yes" is "òc", as opposed to "oil" ("oui") or "sì" in other languages. Latin had no word for "yes", and this is one way to distinguish among Romance languages.

The dialects of Occitan are:
Some of these dialect names were used in the past to name the whole language (Provençal, Limousin, Gascon).
