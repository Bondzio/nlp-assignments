Henk Hofland

Hendrik Johannes Adrianus "Henk" Hofland (; 20 July 1927 – 21 June 2016) was a Dutch journalist, commentator, essayist and columnist. H.J.A. Hofland, as he is also commonly known, is often referred to as the éminence grise of Dutch journalism. 

In 1999 he was named Dutch "Journalist of the century" in a nationwide poll among his fans. He once called himself as belonging to the "anarcho-liberal community", though his political orientation is that of the secular center of society.
