Voivod

Voivod is a heavy metal band from Canada. Their musical style has been changing since their beginnings. They started out as a speed metal band, but eventually began adding a mix of progressive metal and thrash metal to create their own unique metal style.

Today, Voivod have released eleven studio albums as well as one EP, one live album, two compilations, seven demos and one DVD featuring a live concert. They rose to popularity with their fifth studio album "Nothingface" (1989), which was the first Voivod album to enter the "Billboard" 200 charts, peaking at number 114, and is their most successful one yet. The last studio album Voivod released is 2009's "Infini", which contains songs that were recorded before their guitarist Denis D'Amour (Piggy) died in 2005.

Voivod is also the band bassist Jason Newsted joined after he left Metallica in 2001.
