Closeted

Closeted and in the closet are metaphors used to describe lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning and intersex (LGBTQI) people who have not disclosed their sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex characteristics. After disclosure, they are said to have "come out of the closet."
