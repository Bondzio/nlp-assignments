Vashi Bridge

The Vashi Bridge, also called Thane Creek Bridge, is a bridge that connects the city of Mumbai to the mainland of India at Navi Mumbai. It is built across the Thane Creek. The bridge links Mankhurd in Mumbai with Vashi in Navi Mumbai, the satellite city of Mumbai. It is one of four entry points into Mumbai, and handles traffic in the region to the south and east of Mumbai.

The first bridge to connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai was made in 1973. The bridge is 1837Â metres in length and has a below-requirement 3 lane carriageway. Within two years of its opening to traffic, corrosion cracks were noticed on some parts of the bridge. This led to a series of extensive repairs. It was then decided to construct a new bridge to replace the faulty one. 

Construction on a new bridge began in 1987 and opened in 1997. The original Vashi Bridge or the 1st Thane Creek Bridge remains closed to traffic.

The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has plans to add six more lanes to the Vashi Bridge at an estimated cost of 400 crore.
