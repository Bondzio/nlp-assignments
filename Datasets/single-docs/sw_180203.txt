Tachyon

A tachyon is any hypothetical particle that can travel faster than the speed of light. The concept is an invention of O. M. P. Bilaniuk, V. K. Deshpande, and E. C. G. Sudarshan in 1962

Most scientists think that tachyons do not exist. Einstein's theory of special relativity says nothing can accelerate faster than the speed of light, the theory is that these particles would be constantly traveling faster than the speed of light. If a tachyon did exist, it would have an imaginary number as its mass. 

Many scientists believe that if one tachyon existed in the universe at any time, then the universe would be overrun by more and more tachyons. Tachyon is a device that will gain speed as it looses energy. So if a Tachyon starts moving at some speed after some time it will come at a point where it will catch the speed of light and then it will continually gain speed. 

This is probably due to the fact that as they slow down, they increase energy. However, some scientists still believe that they could exist if they did not interact with normal matter.

It was once thought that neutrinos in experiments at the ATLAS detector in CERN might have moved faster than the speed of light, which was a problem because neutrinos do have a positive, real number mass. This lead to further investigations into more unusual theories of, for example, how particles with normal mass may move faster than light speed, and some claimed that this result would disprove general relativity. However, it was later revealed that the abnormal results were almost certainly the consequence of instrument failure, leading a wide dismissal of tachyonic behaviour in this instance, although some have remained confident that the theories used to explain the faster-than-light case would still be found accurate. Claims that these observations would disprove general relativity, which was reported probably unhelpfully widely in the press, now also seem unlikely. .
