Virgo (constellation)

Virgo is a zodiac constellation which lies on the celestial equator. It is between Leo (at west), Libra (at east) and this one of the biggest constellation you can see on the sky

Virgo's most briliant and important star is Spica (α Virginis). This star helps to see Virgo. Other important stars are Zavijava (β Virginis), Porrima (ν Virginis) or Auva, also called Minelava.

Because there is a galaxy cluster (the Virgo cluster) within its borders, this constellation is especially rich in galaxies.
