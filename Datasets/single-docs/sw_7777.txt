Board game

A board game is a game usually played with pieces on a board, or some area with marked spaces. Many board games use pieces that may be moved, placed, or traded depending on the rules of the game. These pieces may be money, chips, pawns, or other objects. Board games may also involve some random chance with dice or cards, for example. There are many board games with a long history in some cultures. Examples of these games are chess, checkers, backgammon, parqu√©s, and go. There are also a great number of popular board games that have been created more recently, in the past hundred years. Among these games are Scrabble and Monopoly. 

Chess, and most versions of checkers, are played on a 8x8 square board with 32 white squares and 32 black squares. International checkers is played on a 10x10 square board.
