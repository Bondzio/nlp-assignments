Östersund Ski Stadium

The Östersund Ski Stadium () is a facility for cross-country skiing, biathlon and ski orienteering in the town of Östersund in Sweden. It was appointed national stadium for Swedish biathlon in October 2013 . Since 2007 the stadium has always snow starting on 1 November. This is because it uses leftover snow gathered by Östersund Municipality over the spring and summertime season.
