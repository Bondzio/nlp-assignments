Paraves

Paraves is a branch-based clade containing birds (clade Aves) and other closely related dinosaurs. The paravians include the Avialae, such as "Archaeopteryx", and the Deinonychosauria, which includes the dromaeosaurids and troodontids.

The name Paraves was coined by Paul Sereno in 1997. The clade was defined by Sereno in 1998 as a branch-based clade containing all Maniraptora closer to modern birds than to "Oviraptor".

The work of Xu and colleagues provide examples of basal and early paravians with four wings, including members of the Avialae ("Pedopenna"), Dromaeosauridae ("Microraptor"), and Troodontidae ("Anchiornis").

The cladogram presented below follows a study by Zhang and colleagues.
