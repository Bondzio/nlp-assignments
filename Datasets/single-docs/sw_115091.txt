Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island

Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (called in Japan) is a platform video game made by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game console. A follow-up game called "Yoshi's Story" was released for the Nintendo 64, and a direct sequel was released for the Nintendo DS called "Yoshi's Island DS".

"Yoshi's Island" takes place many years before "Donkey Kong", the first "Mario" game. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi are being taken to their parents by the Stork, but a Magikoopa named Kamek attacks it, kidnapping Baby Luigi and causing Baby Mario to drop to Yoshi's Island. Baby Mario lands on the back of Yoshi, who, along with seven other Yoshis, helps Baby Mario defeat Baby Bowser and rescue Baby Luigi.
