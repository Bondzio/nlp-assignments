Nimrod Expedition

The British Antarctic Expedition 1907â€“09 was also called the Nimrod Expedition. It was the first of three expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton. The point of the journey, was to reach the South Pole. They did not reach the South Pole. They made it 180.6 kilometers (or 112.2 miles) away from their destination. This was the farthest journey to that date. The group was also the first to climb Mount Erebus.

When the group returned, they nearly became worldwide hero's. Shackleton received many awards. These included a knighthood from King Edward VIII. Three years later, the group's record was broken by another group led by Edgeworth David.
