Jam

Jam is a condiment. It is made from pressed fruit usually, by adding sugar, and sometimes pectin. Most jams are cooked. After making, jam is normally put into a jar.

Usually a jam contains as much sugar as it contains fruit. The two parts are then cooked together.

In the European Union, there is the jam directive (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July 1979). It sets minimum standards for the amount of "fruit" in jam, but the definition of fruit was expanded. This was done to take several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU into account. For this purpose, "fruit" is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated as fruits, such as tomatoes; fruits that are not normally made into jams, such as melons and watermelons; and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams, such as: rhubarb (the edible part of the stalks), carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, and pumpkins. This definition continues to apply in the new directive, Council Directive 2001/113/EC (20 December 2001).

Marmalade is jam made from oranges and tends to have pulp and peels.

Jelly is different from jam as it is made from mostly juice instead of fruit.

Fruit butters are made from slow cooking fruit to a smooth consistency.

Joan Mir√≥ used blackberry jam as an art medium.

Jam is an interesting condiment because its neither a solid or a liquid. It can contain chunks of fruit which are solids, but if let out of the fridge the juicy bit becomes a liquid. Also Jam moves to fit a contain, which is one of the properties of a liquid.
