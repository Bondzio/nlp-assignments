Labium

Labium (plural "labia") is a Latin-derived term meaning "Lip". "Labium" and its derivatives (including labia, labial, labrum and "labellum") are used to describe any lip-like structure, but in the English language, "labium" often specifically refers to parts of the vulva.

A variant of the word, "labellum" (plural: "labella"), is used by people studying entomology and botany.
