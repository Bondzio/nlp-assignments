Daily Star

The Daily Star is a tabloid newspaper in the United Kingdom. It was first published on 2 November 1978. In 2011, it made 706,757 copies every day. It is quite similar to "The Sun". It tries to be cheaper so more people buy it than "The Sun". Although other newspapers have their favourite political party, the "Daily Star" does not. However, it was against Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2009. To attract women and teenage girls the "Daily Star" has a horoscope column.
