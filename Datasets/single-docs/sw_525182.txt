Abu Ali al-Anbari

Abu Ali al-Anbari (; died 12 December 2015) was an Iraqi government official. He was the nom de guerre for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) governor for territories held by the organization in Syria. He was thought to be the second-in-command (along with his counterpart Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (KIA) who held a similar position in Iraq). 

He plays a political role of overseeing the local councils and acts as a kind of political envoy. His military role includes directing operations against both other Syrian rebels who oppose President Bashar al-Assad's government and the Syrian government itself.

In November 2015, the New York Times reported that al-Anbari had recently arrived in Libya by boat, where the group has established a powerful branch centered in the city of Sirte. On December 12, 2015 al-Anbari was killed in an airstrike by the Iraqi army.
