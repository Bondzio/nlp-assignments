Starships

"Starships" is a song by Trinidadian-born American recording artist Nicki Minaj. It is the lead single from her second studio album, "". The song was widely compared to her old single, "Super Bass", because they are both pop-sounding hip hop songs. A song from the deluxe version of the album, "Va Va Voom", was originally supposed to be the lead single, but "Starships" was chosen instead.

"Starships" reached the top five in countries like the US, UK, Australia, Belgium (Flanders), France, New Zealand, and Canada. It finished at number 9 on the Canadian and US Hot 100 year-end charts.
