Reticulated python

The Reticulated python (Python reticulatus) is a species of python found in Southeast Asia. Adults can grow to 22.8 feet (6.95 m) in length but normally grow to an average of 9.8-19.7 feet. They are the world's longest snakes and longest reptile, but are not the most heavily built. Like all pythons, they are non-venomous constrictors (they squeeze their prey) and normally not considered dangerous to humans. Although large ones are powerful enough to kill an adult human, attacks are only sometimes reported.
