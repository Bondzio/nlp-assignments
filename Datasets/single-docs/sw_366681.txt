The Emperor's New Groove

The Emperor's New Groove is a 2000 American animated family movie. It was made by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released on December 15, 2000. The title refers to the fairy tale "The Emperor's New Clothes" by Hans Christian Andersen. The movie is not very much like the fairy tale.

The movie received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song for "My Funny Friend and Me" performed by Sting. It lost against "Things Have Changed" by Bob Dylan from "Wonder Boys".

A direct-to-video sequel, "Kronk's New Groove", was released in December 2005. There was also an animated television series, "The Emperor's New School", in January 2006.


Annie Awards are an award each year for animated movies.
