South Chungcheong Province

In ancient times, South Chungcheong Province belonged to Mahan - the ancient tribal country of Korea. After Baekje conquered Mahan, it belonged to Baekje. Later, in the Goryeo Dynasty, it was grouped with current Gyeonggi-do and North Chungcheong into 'Gwangyang-do'. In the Joseon Dynasty, South Chungcheong and North Chungcheong were reorganized into Chungcheong-do. On October 4, 1896, it was separated as South Chungcheong.
