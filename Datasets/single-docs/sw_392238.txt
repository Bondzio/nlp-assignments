Growth hormone

Growth hormone (GH or HGH), also known as somatotropin or somatropin, is a hormone responsible for growth, cell reproduction and regeneration in humans and other animals. It is specific only to certain kinds of cells.
Growth hormone is used as a prescription drug in medicine to treat children's and adults growth disorders. In the United States, it is only available legally by prescription from a doctor. Today HGH is still considered a very complex hormone, and many of its functions are still unknown.
