The Black Cauldron (movie)

The Black Cauldron is a 1985 American animated dark fantasy movie produced by Walt Disney Productions. It is based on the first two books in "The Chronicles of Prydain" by Lloyd Alexander, a series of five novels which in turn is based on Welsh mythology.

The movie is about the evil Horned King who hopes to secure the magical Black Cauldron and rule the world with its help. 

The movie is directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich. They directed the previous Disney animated movie "The Fox and the Hound".

It was not very popular when it was first released. Now it has become a cult movie. It cost $25 million to make. It earned only $21 million at the North American box office. It is said to be one of the worst box-office failures from Walt Disney Animation Studios.
