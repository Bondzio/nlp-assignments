July Ultimatum

The July Ultimatum was a Demarche issued by Austria-Hungary to Serbia at 6 pm on 23 July 1914. Serbia refused to accept one of the ten items of the ultimatum, and so Austria-Hungary mobilised their army. This, along with a chain of Alliances in Europe (Triple Entente and Central Powers) helped cause World War I.
