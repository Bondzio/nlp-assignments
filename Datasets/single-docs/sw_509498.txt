Dick Nanninga

Dirk "Dick" Jacobus Willem Nanninga (17 January 1949 – 21 July 2015) was a Dutch footballer, who played for the Dutch clubs BV Veendam, Roda JC and MVV Maastricht. He also had a short spell with Hong Kong club Seiko.

Nanninga earned 15 caps and scored 6 goals for the Netherlands national football team. In the 1978 FIFA World Cup final, he scored the equalizing goal against Argentina in normal time; however, Argentina went on to win 3–1 in extra time.

In 2012 Nanninga went into a coma and only regained conscience five months later. Due to diabetes his left lower leg had to be amputated.

Having lost left lower leg, he was asked what he missed most about not having a leg. The answer went along the lines of, "..er, well, actually eh..., the lower part." In 2014 his right lower leg also had to be amputated. His death was announced on 21 July 2015.
