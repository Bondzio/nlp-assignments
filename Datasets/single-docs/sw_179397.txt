Virgin Mobile Festival

The Virgin Festival (known from 2008 as the Virgin Mobile Festival in the United States) is a rock music festival held in the United States and Canada, a spin-off from the V Festival held in the UK. In North America the Virgin name, and later the Virgin Mobile brand, has been used in full to make the brand more effective there, compared with the UK and Australian festivals, where association is simply implied through the use of the V.
