Robert Novak

Robert David Sanders "Bob" Novak (February 26, 1931 â€“ August 18, 2009) was an American television journalist, writer and lawyer. He was a reporter for the "Wall Street Journal, "and the Associated Press before joining the "Chicago Sun-Times "as an opinion political columnist along with Rowland Evans. He, along with Evans began as a liberal supporter of John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Nelson Rockefeller but soon moved to the right. By 1964 he was supporting Barry Goldwater for president. He was born in Joliet, Illinois.

Novak was a host and political analyst for the Cable News Network beginning in 1980. In 1982 he and Rowland Evans began hosting "Evans & Novak" on that network. (That program was later called "Evans, Novak, Hunt, & Shields" after CNN contributors Mark Shields and Al Hunt joined the panel, and after Rowland Evans died, "Novak, Hunt, & Shields".) He co-hosted Cable News Network's "Crossfire". He was founder, executive producer, and co-host of "Capital Gang "on that network. He was fired by Cable News Network in 2005, partially as a result of an incident where he stormed off set after cursing at fellow CNN political analyst James Carville. He joined Fox News Network that year. 

Novak died from brain cancer in Washington, D.C., aged 78.
