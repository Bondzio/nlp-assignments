In 1947 East Bengal became part of Pakistan (East Pakistan) - and the Jamaat-e-Islami was divided into separate Indian and Pakistani parties. The Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh originates from the East Pakistani party. The Jamaat were against Bangladesh becoming independent from Pakistan as they thought it was against Islam. However the Jamaat were unable to stop Bangladesh becoming independent of Pakistan.

Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami was banned after independence of Bangladesh. Jamaat was banned in Bangladesh due to its opposite stand against independent Bangladesh during independence war. Jamaat wished to see united Pakistan. After independence of Bangladesh, the top leaders of Jamaat moved to West Pakistan where Jamaat-e-Islami was born. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh, also cancelled the citizenship of Golam Azam, the leader of Jamaat. Azam then moved to London, and some other leaders moved to the Middle East. However Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975 and army chief Ziaur Rahman seized power. Rahman allowed the Jamaat to be a political party again. Rahman also allowed Azam to return to Bangladesh as the leader of Jamaat.
