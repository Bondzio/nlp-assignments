Flow (psychology)

Flow is a term used in psychology to mean the mental state of a person completely immersed in an activity. It is an altered state of consciousness. The person is fully focused, performing actively and successfully. The situation is widely recognised by phrases like "in the zone", "in the bubble", "on the ball", "in the moment", "wired in", "in the groove". The performer almost loses touch with their surroundings: phrases like "lost to the world" reflect this mental absorption. 

The term "flow" was given to this experience by a psychologist, who found it was completely focused motivation. The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task, although flow is also described as a deep focus on nothing but the activity – not even oneself or one's emotions.

Csíkszentmihályi identifies the following ten factors as accompanying an experience of flow:

Not all are needed for flow to be experienced.

Flow operates on both physical and mental tasks. It applies to dance, football, chess and many other areas where people perform tasks in well-defined competitive situations, but also in art where the situation may be much more open. Evidence about flow comes from interviews with people after various types of performance. Efforts are being made to develop ways of enhancing flow for personal and commercial benefit.
