Bizen Province

The province had borders with Mimasaka, Harima, and Bitchū Provinces.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Okayama.

In 713 ("Wadō era 6, 3rd month"), the land of Bizen"-no kuni" was separated from Mimasaka Province (美作国).

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Bizen Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Kitbitsuhiko jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Bizen.
