Zabardust Khan

Zabardust Khan or Zabardust Khan Tanoli also known by his nick-name Suba Khan Tanoli (died 1797) was a chieftain of the Hindkowan Tanoli tribe, of Hazara region, in 18th century India. This area is now part of North-West Pakistan. 

Zabardust Khan was appointed a "nazim" (area administrator) in upper Hazara by the Afghan King Taimur Shah Durrani (or Abdali) in 1775 or 1776. Most local people then gave him the nick-name of 'Suba Khan' (means 'area chief') and he became known by this name. He was a good administrator at a very violent and bad time in history. He tried his best to help people, ensure peace in his area and control prices of food and other goods. For this reason, he is still remembered by people in that area today. They often go to pray at his grave . 

Zabardust/Suba Khan Tanoli died in 1797. He is not to be confused with a Pathan soldier called Zabardast Khan, who fought at the Third Battle of Panipat.
