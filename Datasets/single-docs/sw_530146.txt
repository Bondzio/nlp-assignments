Mathematical optimization

In many branches of science, including mathematics, mathematical optimization is a branch that is about finding the element that gives an optimal solution to a problem, given some criteria. In the simplest case, this means that a function needs to be minimized or maximized. 

Many problems are more complex, though, and solving them analytically is not feasible: in these cases, numerical methods are often used.
