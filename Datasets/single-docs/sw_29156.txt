Chinese character

Chinese characters are symbols used to write the Chinese and Japanese languages. In the past, other languages like Korean and Vietnamese also used them. The beginning of these characters was at least 3000 years ago, making them one of the oldest continuously-used (meaning it has not fallen out of use) writing systems in the world. In Chinese they are called "hanzi" (), which means "Han character". In Japanese they are called "kanji" and in Korean "hanja".

Chinese characters are an important part of East Asian culture. Chinese characters may be considered to be abstract art, because of how the characters are made up of lines and dots. The art of writing Chinese characters is called calligraphy.

Chinese characters are a type of logogram; they mainly represent words instead of sounds. Most earlier Chinese characters were pictographs, which are simple pictures used to mean some kind of thing or idea. Today, very few modern Chinese characters are pictographs, but are a combination of two or more simple characters, also known as radicals. While many radicals and characters show a word's meaning, not all characters neatly fit that description. Sometimes a radical or even an entire character itself hints at the word's pronunciation, instead of its meaning.

To better explain the purpose of different Chinese characters, Chinese scholars have divided Chinese characters into six categories known as "liushu" (六书/六書) literally translated as the "Six Books", or the six categories of writing. The six types of Chinese characters are:




Examples of words with phonetic loan characters that are common in today's world are the names of countries, such as Canada, which is pronounced "Jiānádà" (加拿大) in Chinese. While the third character 大 "dà", which has the meaning "big/large/great", seems to describe Canada well, since it is a big country, the first two characters 加 "jiā", meaning "to add", and 拿 "ná", meaning "to take", have no obvious relation to Canada, so it is safe to say that these characters were chosen only because the pronunciation of each character sounds similar to the syllables of the English name of the country.



Nobody knows exactly how many Chinese characters there are, but the biggest Chinese dictionaries list about fifty thousand characters, though most of them are only a bit different from each other and only seen in very old texts. For example, the character 回 (huí) has also been written as the variant characters 迴，廻，囬，逥，廽，and 囘, although most Chinese people only know and use the variant 回. Studies in China show that normally three to four thousand characters are used on a daily basis, so it is safe to say that one needs to know three to four thousand characters to be functionally literate in Chinese, or can be able to read an everyday text without serious problems.

Characters are a kind of graphic language, much different from languages that use a alphabet such as English. The correct way tell between them is to remember the structure and meaning of every character, not pronunciation because there is very close relationship between meaning and structure of characters. Example: 房(house)=户+方. 房 is a shape-pronunciation character. 户 is for shape and 方 is for pronunciation. 户 means 'door'. 房 means 'A person lives behind a door'. 方 pronunciation is "fang" and tone is 1, and with the tone mark it is written as "fāng". 房 pronunciation is also "fang", but tone is 2, with the tone mark it is written as "fáng".

There are still many Chinese characters that are used in Japanese and Korean. Generally the education level of a Japanese person is decided by the amount of Chinese characters understood by this person. While Koreans nowadays mostly write in hangul, the native Korean alphabet, people have found that some meanings cannot be expressed clearly by just hangul, so people need to use Chinese characters as a note with a bracket. Before 1446, Korean people only used Chinese characters.
