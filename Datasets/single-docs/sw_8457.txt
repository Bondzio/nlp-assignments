Waiter

A waiter is a person who "waits" on tables, often at a restaurant or cafe. A female waiter is called a waitress. They will take orders and delivers food to customers. A good waiter can also help the customers by recommending the best food in the restaurant or cafe.

Many waiters and waitresses are required by their employers to wear a uniform. Most uniforms used are black and white or all black. Historically the term waiter was used to describe customs officers who waited on the high tide for vessels to come in carrying goods to tax.
