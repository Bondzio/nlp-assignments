Los Angeles Galaxy

The Los Angeles Galaxy, branded as the LA Galaxy, are an American soccer team that plays in Major League Soccer in Carson, California. They shared their home field, StubHub Center, with Chivas USA before that team folded at the end of the 2014 season.

Until he left when his contract ended after the 2012 season, the team's best-known player was English icon David Beckham, signed from Real Madrid in 2007. Landon Donovan, the all-time leading goal scorer for the US national team, has been with the Galaxy since 2005, except for a retirement of nearly two years from the end of the 2014 season until late in the 2016 season. Robbie Keane, the Republic of Ireland's captain, leading scorer, and most-capped (most games) player, is the Galaxy's current captain. The team also includes longtime Liverpool and England star Steven Gerrard.
