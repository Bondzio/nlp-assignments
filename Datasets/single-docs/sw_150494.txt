Leedsichthys

Leedsichthys problematicus, ('Leeds fish') was a giant fossil fish of the Jurassic period. It was a pachycormid, a group of extinct ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). "Leedsichthys" is the largest fish known, with an estimated length of up to 16 meters. The Blue Whale is twice as long, at 30 metres, but that is a mammal, not a fish.

Leedsichthys fossils are incomplete, making it impossible to know the exact length. The fossil is named after its discoverer, Alfred Nicholson Leeds, who discovered it before 1886 near Peterborough, England.

Like the worlds biggest fish today, the Whale shark, the "Leedsichthys problematicus" was a filter feeder, getting its nutrition from plankton. Remains of over 70 individuals have now been found.
