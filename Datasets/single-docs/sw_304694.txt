Phil Jones (footballer)

Philip Anthony "Phil" Jones (born 21 February 1992) is an English footballer. Jones plays as a defender for Manchester United and the England under-21 national team. He played for Blackburn Rovers at both youth and senior levels before joining Manchester United. Jones usually plays central defender, but can also play as a right back or defensive midfielder.

Jones was born in Preston, Lancashire. He grew up in Clayton-le-Woods. He joined Blackburn Rovers' youth team in 2002. He joined the senior team for the 2009–10 Premier League season. Jones signed a two-year contract with the team. He wore uniform number 28 for Blackburn. He played his first game for Blackburn on 22 September 2009 in a League Cup game against Nottingham Forest. Blackburn won 1–0. In February 2010, he signed a new five-year contract. The contract had a £16 million release clause. Jones made his first Premier League start for Blackburn against Chelsea on 21 March. The game was a 1–1 draw at Ewood Park.

Jones started the 2010–11 season in midfield. He became one of the starters for the team. Jones hurt his knee in a game against West Ham United in December 2010. He could not play for three months because of the injury.

On 13 June 2011, Manchester United said that they had reached a deal to sign Jones. The deal was for an undisclosed transfer fee. The deal would be finished upon his return from international games. He played his first game for the club on the 2011 pre-season tour to the USA, in United's 3–1 victory over Chicago Fire. Jones played as a second-half substitute, replacing Rio Ferdinand, in a 3–2 win over rivals Manchester City in the 2011 Community Shield. Jones played in his first Premier League game for United a week later. He entered again as a substitute for Ferdinand. United beat West Bromwich Albion 2–1 on the opening weekend.

Jones played his first game for the England under-19 team in the 3–1 win over Turkey on 17 November 2009. He has since played three more times for the under-19s.

On 4 August 2010, Jones joined the England under-21 squad. On 10 August, Jones won his first under-21 cap, starting for England against Uzbekistan. He was substituted in the 46th minute and was replaced by Liverpool's Martin Kelly. He was selected for the 2011 U-21 European Championship in Denmark. Manager Stuart Pearce made Jones the captain of the team.

In 5 August 2011, he joined the England first-team squad for the friendly against the Netherlands. The game was cancelled four days later by the FA after the riots in London.

In November 2011, he competed in two home games for England at Wembley. The first was a 1-0 win against the world champions, Spain. The second was also a 1-0 win over Sweden. In both games he played midfield, this is in contrast to his 'right back' role for his club side, Manchester United.
