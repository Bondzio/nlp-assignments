Blue-green

Blue-green is a color that is a deep tone of cyan.

On the older red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel (in which red, yellow and blue were called the primary colors and orange, green, and violet were called the secondary colors), "blue-green" was a third color between blue and green. The other third colors on a red-yellow-blue (RYB) color wheel were called red-violet, blue-violet, yellow-green, yellow-orange and red-orange.
