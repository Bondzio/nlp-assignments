One-party dominant state

The one-party dominant state is a system of majority rule where one political party has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. 

The one-party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. 

Many one-party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control, but some one-party dominant states are real democracies, where there are no limits by law against other parties.

A case of this was Mexico, where Presidential candidates (person running for this governmental office) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years.
