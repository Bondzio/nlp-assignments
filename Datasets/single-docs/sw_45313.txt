Harold Wilson

James Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx, KG, OBE, FRS, PC (11 March 1916 – 24 May 1995) was one of the most prominent British politicians of the 20th century. He was an MP from 1945-1983. He won more elections than any other 20th century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (in 1964, 1966, February and October 1974) — but only once with a clear majority (1966). 

Wilson resigned as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party in 1976. He died of colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease in 1995.
