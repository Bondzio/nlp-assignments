Joleon Lescott

Joleon Patrick Lescott (born 16 August 1982) is an English footballer who plays for Manchester City and the England national football team. He is a defender who can play on the left or in the centre.

Lescott was born in Birmingham. At 17 he began playing for the Wolverhampton Wanderers. In 2006 he was named in the Championship team of the season. He also got the Wolves' Player of the Year award.

Lescott was sold to Everton at the start of the 2006–07 season. On 8 May 2008, Lescott was voted Everton's Player of the Year and Players Player of the Year.

Following the end of the 2008–09 season, Manchester City tried to sign Lescott. Everton said no. On 11 August 2009, Lescott asked to move to Manchester City. Again Everton said no. The manager said Lescott had a "bad attitude" and did not have him play. Then on 25 August 2009 he was traded to Manchester City. Fans in Everton are now angry at Lescott for leaving. They boo when he takes the field.

On 13 May 2012 Lescott helped Man City win their first premiership title in 44 years.
