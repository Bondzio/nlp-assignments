Marge Champion

Marjorie Celeste "Marge" Champion (n√©e Belcher; born September 2, 1919), is an American dancer, choreographer, and actress. 

At a young age she was hired as a dance model for Walt Disney Studios animated movies. Later she performed as an actress and dancer in movie musicals, and in 1957 had a TV show based on song and dance. 

Champion has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, "The Awakening Land", set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley.

Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including "Show Boat" (1951) and "Everything I Have Is Yours" (1952). MGM wanted the couple to remake Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, but only one, "Lovely to Look At" (1952), a remake of "Roberta" (1935), was completed.
