WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship

The WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship is a wrestling title owned by WWE. It was created for the "SmackDown Live" brand after the return of the brand extension. The WWE Tag Team Championship became exclusive of "Raw". The first champions were Heath Slater and Rhyno and current champions are American Alpha.

With the return of the WWE Brand Extension in the middle of 2016, a draft took place in July 19. The WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) was drafted to "Raw". As a result, "SmackDown Live" was left without a tag team title. On the August 23, 2016 episode of "SmackDown Live", Shane McMahon introduced the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. A tournament was created for determined the first champions. The final match occurred at Backlash on September 11, 2016, and Heath Slater and Rhyno beat The Usos to won the title.

â€  Chad Gable had a injury after beating The Usos and the American Alpha were removed from the final. The Usos then beat The Hype Bros at Backlash to replace American Alpha in the final.

As of 11, 2017.
