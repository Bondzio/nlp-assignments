Newgrounds

Newgrounds is an American website hosted in Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States. Created in 1995, the site has Adobe Flash animations and games, but also features a music and art portal. The site was started and is owned by Tom Fulp. Newgrounds is different from most other Flash websites by its automated submission and rating system. It was the first website in history to produce a fully automated user-made content system.
