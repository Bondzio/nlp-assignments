Inorganic chemistry

Inorganic chemistry is the branch of chemistry which studies the elements, and inorganic compounds. 

Inorganic chemistry can be defined simply as all chemistry which is not organic chemistry. Organic chemistry is basically the study of carbon compounds. Inorganic chemistry studies the elements (including carbon), and all compounds other than carbon compounds. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but this definition covers most cases.
