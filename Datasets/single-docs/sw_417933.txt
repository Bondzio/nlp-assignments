Brookfield Place

Brookfield Place, originally and commonly known as the World Financial Center is a complex of office buildings in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan in New York City. It is near the World Trade Center. It is home to the offices of a number of companies such as Merrill Lynch, American Express, Brookfield Office Properties, and others. It was opened in 1988. It was designed by CÃ©sar Pelli.

The complex was very badly damaged in the September 11 attacks. It had to be closed for several months while repairs were being done.

The complex was renamed to "Brookfield Place" in 2013.
