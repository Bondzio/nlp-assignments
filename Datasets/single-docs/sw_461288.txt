Aberystwyth University

Aberystwyth University () is a "public research university" in Aberystwyth, Wales.

The university was a founding "Member Institution" of the University of Wales, a group of Welsh universities which all issued degrees from the 'University of Wales'. After the University of Wales split, Aberystwyth started issuing its own 'Aberystwyth University' degrees again.

There are over 7,500 students in the University's three main schools of arts, social science and the sciences.
