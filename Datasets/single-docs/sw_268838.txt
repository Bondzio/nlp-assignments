WDC DML 001

WDC DML 001 is the number of a nearly complete troodontid specimen. It was found in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of western North America. The fossil was found in Wyoming, as the site was carefully documented by the collectors.

WDC DML 001 has not yet been officially named, but the specimen is nicknamed "Lori". Lori will be described by scientists from the Wyoming Dinosaur Center, a small natural history museum in Wyoming. 

A phylogenetic analysis was presented in an abstract in the "Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology" in 2005. The analysis decided the specimen was a close relative of "Sinornithoides".

This dinosaur is very significant because it is the oldest known troodontid. Until the discovery of Lori, troodontids were believed to have first originated and evolved in Asia and then migrated to North America. Most troodontids were discovered in Asia, and the previously oldest known troodontids, from the Lower Cretaceous, lived there.
