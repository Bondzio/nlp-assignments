List of IOC country codes

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) uses three-letter abbreviation country codes to call each group of athletes that participate in the Olympic Games.

Since 1952, the list of IOC country codes has changed as new countries were added. Sometimes the names of countries were changed. Some countries have had as many as four different codes.

Some of the National Olympic Committees no longer exist, such as Czechoslovakia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, the USSR, the United Arab Republic, and the West Indies Federation.

Twelve historical NOCs or teams have codes that are still used in the IOC results database to refer to past medal winners from these teams.
