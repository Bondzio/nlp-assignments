McMahon Line

The McMahon Line is a demarcation line drawn on map referred to in the Simla Convention, a treaty between Britain and Tibet signed in 1914.

Although its legal status is disputed, it is currently the effective boundary between China and India.

This dispute was used a pretext in a war between China and India in 1962.
