Rice cracker

A Rice cracker is a Japanese snack made from rice. The traditional rice crackers are called "Senbei" and "arare". Depending on type, they are made from glutenous or non-glutenous rice.

Crackers made from glutenous rice are called "arare" or "okaki". They have a soft texture and easily dissolve in the mouth. Senbei are crackers made from non-glutinous rice and are hard with a coarse texture. Arare rice crackers are often coated with spices, soy sauce or other flavorings. 

Rice crackers have a very old history. They originated during the time of the Han Dynasty (). The first "Senbei" description is in 737. It was a mixture of flour and rice cooked in oil. The first modern rice cracker is called "Soka Senbei".
