Disability Discrimination Act 1995

The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c 50) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which has now been repealed and replaced by the Equality Act 2010 (), except in Northern Ireland where the Act still applies. Formerly, it made it unlawful to discriminate against people in respect of their disabilities in relation to employment, the provision of goods and services, education and transport.
