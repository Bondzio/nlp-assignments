Wetland

In physical geography, a wetland is an environment that combines the properties of land and water. That means wetlands are ecosystems. 

The combination of wet and dry areas means that many more different kinds of plants, animals and insects may live in a wetland than compared to other types of habitat. Because of this great biodiversity, several important wetlands are among the Global 200 ecoregions that the World Wide Fund for Nature listed for conservation to try to get people to protect them.
