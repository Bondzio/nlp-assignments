A Rugrats Passover

"A Rugrats Passover" (possibly known as "Passover" in the opening title) is the sixty-fifth episode of the Nickelodeon show "Rugrats". It aired April 13, 1995.

While attending a Passover seder at Didi's parents' house, Boris and the kids (and later, most of the adults), get locked in the attic because the door doesn't open from the inside. To pass the time, Boris tells the kids the story of why Jews celecrate Passover, and how Moses saved his people from slavery.


"A Rugrats Passover" was released on the VHS "Rugrats: A Rugrats Passover", and will be released on the DVD "Rugrats: The Complete Series".
