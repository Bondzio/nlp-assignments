Jacques Villiers

Jacques Villiers, born the 26th of August 1924 at Vaucresson and died the 13th of March 2012 (88 years old) in Paris, is a French aerospace engineer and public servant. He is the founder of the "Centre d'études de la navigation aérienne" (French air navigation center) and co-founder of the CAUTRA system, the computer system of the French air traffic management.

In the words of Michel Wachenheim: "We can consider Jacques Villiers as one of the main
founders of "the French school of air navigation" with everything
it has scientific expertise, know-how
technological and operational experience. He quickly understood
that France could and should play a leading role in this
sector, because of its aviation history, its ability to
train highly qualified specialists, but also its global ambitions
and European geography. He retained confident until the end that we could provide leadership in technical
international level, I am reminded of conversations with him on this
subject. The best tribute to him is certainly to continue
in this way."
