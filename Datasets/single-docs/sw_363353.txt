Lesbian kiss episode

The "lesbian kiss episode" is a type of the media portrayal of lesbianism in television media. It was made in the 1990s. The first time was in 1991 with a kiss on the American "L.A. Law" series. It was in the episode "He's a Crowd" between C.J. Lamb and Abby Perkins. David E. Kelley wrote the episode. He used the same idea in at least two of his other shows. Later television series included an episode in which a seemingly heterosexual female character has a kiss with a possibly lesbian or bisexual character. Most times, the potential of a relationship between the women does not survive past the episode. The lesbian or suspected lesbian never appears again.
