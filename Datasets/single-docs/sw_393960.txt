In 2013, Maduro denied rumors of homophobia. He stated that if he were gay he would "shout it to the four winds". He said that "I would have no problem loving whoever I had to love with my heart". He also stated that the Ch치vez government had supported LGBT rights starting from 14 years ago, promoting inclusion and non-discrimination.

In March 2016, Maduro endorsed United States senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States.
