Borealopelta

Borealopelta is a large armoured dinosaur. It was found in Alberta, Canada and is a nodosaurid ankylosaur. 

The osteoderms in its armour were in their life positions, with remains of their keratin sheaths and overlying skin. It may be the most complete ankylosaur ever found. Melanin found in its epidermis remains suggests it was camouflaged.

The report gives its estimated length as 5.5 metres and its estimated weight as about ~1,300 kg.
