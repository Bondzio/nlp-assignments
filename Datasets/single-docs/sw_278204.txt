Ted Baillieu

Edward Norman "Ted" Baillieu MLA (born 31 July 1953) is an Australian politician. He was the Premier of Victoria from 2010-2013, and member for the Legislative Assembly seat of Hawthorn. He became the leader of the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia since May 2006 and Premier of Victoria from 2 December 2010 after the Liberal/Nationals Coalition defeated the Brumby-led Australian Labor Party government with 45 seats to 43 in the Legislative Assembly. He resigned as Premier on 6 March 2013. There had been complaints about his ability to lead and there was a scandal involving his Chief of Staff. Earlier on 6 March, a member of the party, Geoff Shaw, resigned which meant Baillieu no longer had a workable majority in Parliament.
