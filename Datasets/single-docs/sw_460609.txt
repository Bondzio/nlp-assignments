Royal Chapel of Dreux

The Royal Chapel of Dreux () is a the traditional resting place for members of the royal House of Orléans. It is located in the town of Dreux in France. 

The land on which the chapel was built on was owned by the famously wealthy Duke of Penthièvre whose daughter Marie Adélaïde married the Duke of Orléans in 1769. Following the death of the Duke of Penthièvre his daughter inherited a majority of his vast estates including the land of Dreux. The Orléans family later used the chapel there as their own personal burial place following the reign of Louis Philippe I.
