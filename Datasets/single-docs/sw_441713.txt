Instagram

Instagram is an online photo and video sharing social networking service. It allows users to take pictures and videos, apply digital filters to them and share them to their followers. They can then share them on a variety of social networking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr. A feature is that it confines photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images. This is different than the 16:9 typically used by digital cameras. Users are also able to record and share short videos lasting for up to 60 seconds.
Instagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. It was released on October 6, 2010
