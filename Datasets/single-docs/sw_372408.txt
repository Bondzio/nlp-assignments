Bullet (typography)

Bullet ( â€¢ ) is a kind of typography. It is a symbol or glyph used to introduce the parts of a list. Bullets are used to draw attention to specific information. 

There are no fixed rules about how to use bullets. Bullet points may be short phrases or single sentences or paragraphs. 

Bullets are most often used in technical writing, reference works, notes and presentations. For example, see bullet points in the box at the right.

When bullets are overused, the emphasis given to each point is less. 

A numbered list is a kind of bullet format.
