Robert Johnson (musician)

Robert Johnson, born Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 â€“ August 16, 1938) is one of the most famous Delta blues musicians.

He was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi. He was the 11th child of his mother Julia Major Dodds, and 10th child of his father Charles Dodds. When he was born, his father had left his mother. He was brought up by a field worker named Noah Johnson. That is why he chose "Johnson" for his family name.

He began playing guitar when he was a child. In February 1929 he married Virginia Travis and became serious about playing the guitar. His wife died in childbirth at the age of 16 in April 1930. Johnson began traveling up and down the Delta. Around 1936, one of his friends who helped many of the blues players, helped him join them.

His death happened on August 16, 1938, at the age of twenty-seven from poisoning.

Eleven grammophone records were made by Robert Johnson with Vocalion during his lifetime, and a twelfth record was made once he had died.

All following songs were released after 1939:
