Committees of the United States Senate

Much of the work of the United States Senate is done in committees, or groups of about 15 Senators. Each committee deals with a certain subject, such as farming or roads. In general, most laws start in a committee before they are voted on by the Senate. Also, when the Senate wants to ask the President or another important person questions, they usually do it in a committee.
