Trilemma

A trilemma is a difficult choice where there are three different options, and where each option looks unfavorable. 

One of the earliest uses of the definition of trilemma is that of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who says there is no omnipotent and omnibenevolent God. David Hume summarized this trilemma as follows:


Although traditionally ascribed to Epicurus, it has been suggested that it may actually be the work of an early skeptic writer, possibly Carneades.

In studies of philosophy, discussions and debates related to this trilemma are often referred to as being about the "problem of evil".
