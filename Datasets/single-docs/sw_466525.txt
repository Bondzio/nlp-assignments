2014 Asian Games

The 2014 Asian Games, officially known as the XVII Asiad, was a sports event in Incheon, South Korea. It happened from September 19 to October 4, 2014. There were 439 events in 36 sports and disciplines.

On April 17, 2007, Incheon was chosen to have the event. Incheon was the third city in South Korea to have the Asian Games. Seoul hosted them in 1986 and Busan hosted them in 2002.

The final medal count was led by China, followed by South Korea and Japan. Fourteen World and 27 Asian records were broken during the Games. Japanese swimmer Kosuke Hagino was announced as the most valuable player (MVP) of the Games. Though there were several controversies, the Games were considered mainly successful. That was helped by the low price and the rising standard of competition between the Asian countries.
