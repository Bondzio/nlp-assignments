Unicameral

A Unicameral system of government is one where there is only one legislative or parliamentary chambers.

It comes from the Latin "uni" (meaning one) and "camera" (meaning chamber).

In the United States, only the state of Nebraska uses a unicameral system. All the other states use a bicameral system instead.
