English National League

The National League is a league for Association football teams in England (though some teams come from Wales).

The league was created in 1979 from the Northern Premier League, Southern League and Isthmian League. In 1987, teams began to be promoted to Football League Two, and from 2002 onwards, a second team was also promoted. The league was renamed to the National League in 2015 as a rebranding.

In 2004, two divisions were created below the main league, known as the National League North and South.
