Futurepop

Futurepop is a type of electronic dance music which uses influences from the genre synthpop (like song structure and vocal style), uplifting trance (grandiose and arpeggiated synthesizer melodies), and EBM. The name was created by Ronan Harris (of VNV Nation) and Stephan Groth (of Apoptygma Berzerk) while trying to describe the style of music their bands produced.
