Religious ministry

Ministry, in Christianity, is the activity that is done by members of the church to serve the purposes of the church. 

It can mean this activity as a whole, or specific activities, or organizations in a church that perform specific activities. 

As churches attempt to meet the needs of their congregations, they often separate their members into groups according to age categories. Age-specific groups meet for religious study including Sunday school programs, fellowship, and other activities. These age divisions may include:

Nearly all churches have some form of worship music, whether from a choir, orchestra, or worship band. 

Many churches sponsor ministries designed to reach out others on a local and global scale, usually grouped under the heading of missions. There are many organizations which perform missions on a fully-funded and organized level, such as North American Mission Board, operated by the Southern Baptist Convention.
