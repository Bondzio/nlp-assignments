Sligo Rovers F.C.

Sligo Rovers are an association football team in Ireland. They were founded in 1928 and now play in the League of Ireland Premier Division.

Rovers have plenty of players who have played in England and the Rovers' manager Ian Baraclough is the only English manager in the UEFA Champions League.

Sligo Rovers were founded in 1928 and have been active ever since. They were founded after the merger of Sligo town and Sligo blues. The all time top goalscorer of the English league Dixie Dean played for Rovers in the 1930s. The last FAI cup competition Rovers won was in 2011. The Rovers have won the league three times in 1937, 1977 and 2012. They won the cup in 1983, 1994, 2010 and 2011 and the first division in 1994 and 2005. During the 2008 season it was confirmed that Rovers were in financial difficulty and needed to pay 130,000 euro, but they are now one of the richest clubs in Ireland.

Sligo Rovers play in The Showgrounds, Sligo. The ground can hold 5,500 people with seats for 4,000. There are two training pitches, and one of them is made from astroturf. In the car park for part of the year there is a fun fair.

Sligo Rovers have two main sponsors, Joma and Connolly's Volkswagen.
