Tab key

The tab key (short for tabulator key or tabular key) is a key on a computer keyboard, found right above the caps lock key on the far left. It is used to take the cursor to the next tab stop.

In word processor applications, the tab key usually moves the cursor to the next tab stop. In most other graphical applications, the tab key shifts the focus to the next control or widget.
