Chiang Kai-shek

Chiang Kai-shek was a soldier and President of the Republic of China, born in Xikou on October 31, 1887. His father was a merchant who died when Chiang was eight years old. Chiang became an officer in the army of the Manchu empire, but supported the Chinese Xinhai Revolution of 1911 that converted China into a republic. He led the Republic of China from 1930 to 1949 on mainland China until he was overthrown by Mao Zedong. He then fled to Taiwan where he ruled from 1950 until his death in 1975, although his government was still officially called the Republic of China.

After his father died, he joined the army. At first, he went to Baoding in northern China to study military science. Later, he went to Japan to learn more knowledge about the military. On October 10, 1911, Jiang Kai-Shek came back to China. He took out the Communists and successfully made China combine together. 

He focused on fighting the Communists and the Japanese. In 1918, he joined the Nationalist Party of Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen helped Jiang Kai-Shek make a military academic school called Huangpu Military School. After Sun Yat-sen died, he pushed out the Communists in 1927. In 1928, he made a new government in Nanjing, and he let himself be a head of the state.
