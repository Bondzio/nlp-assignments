Chance the Rapper

Chancelor Johnathan Bennett (born April 16, 1993), known professionally as Chance the Rapper, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and philanthropist from the West Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. 

Chance was born to a middle-class family in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at Jones College Prep High School. Following a 10-day suspension in early 2011 during his senior year for possessing marijuana on campus, Bennett recorded his first full-length project, a mixtape titled "10 Day" (also known as "#10Day").

In 2013, he began to gain recognition following the release of his second mixtape, "Acid Rap". Apart from his solo career, he is also a member of the Chicago collective Save Money (along with frequent collaborator Vic Mensa), and has worked as the lead vocalist for the band The Social Experiment. They released the widely lauded album "Surf" in May 2015.

In May 2016, Bennett released his third mixtape "Coloring Book". It earned him three Grammy awards, including for Best Rap Album. "Coloring Book" was the first streaming-only album to ever receive and win a Grammy nomination.

On March 6, 2017, after a bad meeting with Governor Bruce Rauner only days before, Chance announced his plans to donate $1,000,000 to Chicago Public Schools in order to help offset the lack of government funding provided.

In July 2015, Chance announced that he was expecting his first child with his girlfriend Kirsten, whom he began to date in 2013. In September 2015, Kirsten gave birth to their daughter. Chance and Kirsten separated in 2016.

Chance is a Christian.
