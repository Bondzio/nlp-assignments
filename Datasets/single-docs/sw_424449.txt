Kapilavastu

Kapilavastu ("Kapilavatthu") is the name of the place where Gautama Buddha grew up, and where his family home was located. It was located in the ancient Shakya kingdom, which is today part of Nepal. The exact location of Kapilavastu is not known; it is assumed to be about 10Â kilometers to the west of Lumbini, where Buddha was born.

Buddha spent the first 29 years of his life in the area of Kapilavastu.
