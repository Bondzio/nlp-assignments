Lev Ivanov

Lev Ivanovich Ivanov (1834-1901) was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer. He became Second Balletmaster of the Imperial Ballet. Ivanov is credited with choreographing "The Nutcracker" in 1892 due to the ill health of Ballet Master Marius Petipa. The extent of his work is disputed. Only Pepita's name appeared on posters for the first production. Ivanov also worked with Petipa on a restaging of "Swan Lake"in 1895. He choreographed Acts 2 and 4, and the Italian and Hungarian dances in Act 3. Other ballets choreographed by Ivanov as the Second Balletmaster to Petipa include "The Enchanted Forest" (1887), and "The Tulip of Haarlem" (1887). Ivanov is credited with the choreography for the "Polovetsian Dances" in the first production of Borodin's "Prince Igor" in 1890. Late in life, Ivanov petitioned the Imperial Theatres for financial assistance on the strength of his 50 years of service. He died in poverty.
