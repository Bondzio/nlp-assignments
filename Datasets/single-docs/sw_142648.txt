Minority group

A minority or subordinate group is a group that does not make up most of the population of a society. It includes for examples, minor group of religion, race, language and further of LGBT or of persons with disabilities. 

A minority is not always a minority of numbers â€” it may be any group that is not normal with respect to a leading group in terms of social status, education, employment, wealth and political power and can be an object of discrimination. For example, women may be considered a minority even if there are as many women as men because they have less power than men.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by United Nations protects the right of minority group in Article 27 and Council of Europe also affirms protection for them.
