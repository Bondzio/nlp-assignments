Miscegenation

Miscegenation is the mixing of different racial groups with marriage, relationship, sexual relations, and procreation.
The word "miscegenation" has been used since the 19th century to give a name to interracial marriage, interracial dating and interracial sex, and in ancient history study about human race mixtures. Today, the use of the phrase is considered outdated and offensive.
