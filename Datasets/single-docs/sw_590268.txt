The Wild Bunch is a 1969 American epic Western Technicolor and Panavision movie directed by Sam Peckinpah about an aging outlaw gang on the Texasâ€“Mexico border, trying to exist in the changing modern world of 1913. The movie was controversial because of its graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.
