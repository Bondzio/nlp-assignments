Book of Wisdom

The Book of Wisdom (also called Wisdom of Solomon or just Wisdom) is one of the books of the Old Testament. It has been grouped among the Septuagint, or the seven wisdom books of the Bible.

A priest named St. Melito, who lived in the second century AD, said that the book was considered canonical by Jews and Christians, and that Naá¸¥manides was able to translate the book into Hebrew when he wrote the Pentateuch.

The book was initially written in the Greek language, but had the style of Hebrew poetry. No one really knows who wrote the book, but some archeologists think that it was most likely Solomon who had written it. This is based on some of the style and language of the book. For example, "Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters: Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount..." The style here looks a lot like another book of the Septuagint, called the Ecclesiastes, "I, Koheleth, was king in Jerusalem over Israel," which also leaves out Solomon's name, but implies through the style. Some Christians at the time knew that King Solomon wasn't the author of the book, as told by the Muratorian fragment that the book was "written by the friends of Solomon in his honor." That is why other people do not believe King Solomon was the true author. A Catholic Encyclopedia also had said: "at the present day, it is freely admitted that Solomon is not the writer of the Book of Wisdom, which has been ascribed to him because its author, through a literary fiction, speaks as if he were the Son of David." Even though the book was called the Wisdom of Solomon, it was probably finished long after he died.

The book has the most classical Greek language of all the books in the Septuagint. It also had much of the Hebrew style that had existed when the book was written. The writer also must have been deeply involved in the philosophical, religious, and ethical writings in Hellenistic Alexandria.
