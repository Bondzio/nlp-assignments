Surjective function

In mathematics, a surjective or onto function is a function "f" : "A" → "B" with the following property. For every element "b" in the codomain "B" there is at least one element "a" in the domain "A" such that "f"("a")="b". This means that the range and codomain of "f" are the same set.

The term "surjection" and the related terms "injection" and "bijection" were introduced by the group of mathematicians that called itself . In the 1930s, this group of mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics. The French prefix "sur" means "above" or "onto" and was chosen since a surjective function maps its domain on to its codomain.

Formally:
The element formula_4 is called the image of the element formula_5. 
The element formula_5 is called a pre-image of the element formula_4. 

A pre-image does not have to be unique. In the top image, both {X} and {Y} are pre-images of the element {1}. It is only important that there be at least one pre-image. (See also: Injective function, Bijective function)
Let "f"("x"):ℝ→ℝ be a real-valued function "y"="f"("x") of a real-valued argument "x". (This means both the input and output are numbers.)
Example: The linear function of a slanted line is "onto". That is, "y"="ax"+"b" where "a"≠0 is a surjection. (It is also an injection and thus a bijection.)
Example: The cubic polynomial (of third degree) "f"("x")="x"-3"x" is a surjection. 

Example: The quadratic function "f"("x") = "x" is not a surjection. There is no "x" such that "x" = −1. The range of "x"² is <nowiki>[0,+∞) </nowiki>, that is, the set of non-negative numbers. (Also, this function is not an injection.)

Note: One can make a non-surjective function into a surjection by "restricting" its codomain to elements of its range. For example, the "new" function, "f"("x"):ℝ → [0,+∞) where "f"("x") = "x" is a surjective function. (This is not the same as the restriction of a function which restricts the domain!)

Example: The exponential function "f"("x") = 10 is not a surjection. The range of "10" is (0,+∞), that is, the set of positive numbers. (This function is an injection.)

Example: The logarithmic function base 10 "f"("x"):<nowiki>(0,+∞)</nowiki>→ℝ defined by "f"("x")=log("x") or "y"=log("x") is a surjection (and an injection). (This is the inverse function of 10.)


Example: The function "f"(("x","y")):ℝ²→ℝ defined by "z"="y" is a surjection. Its graph is a plane in 3-dimensional space. The pre-image of "z" is the line y="z" in the "x"0"y" plane.
