Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands

The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands is a micronation created as a symbolic political protest by a group of gay rights activists based in southeast Queensland, Australia. Declared in 2004 in response to the Australian government's refusal to recognise same-sex marriages. It is near the islets on the Great Barrier Reef. It is an expression of queer nationalism.
