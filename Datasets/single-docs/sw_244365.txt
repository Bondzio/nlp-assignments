Georges Seurat

Georges-Pierre Seurat, (2 December 1859 – 29 March 1891) was a French Post-Impressionist painter. 

Seurat painted for a time with the Impressionist painters, Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and Pissarro. His scientific ideas about colour then led him to develop a different painting technique. He painted in tiny dots of colour, with the theory that the viewer's eye would mix them. This technique is called "pointillism". 

Seurat and his followers are often referred to as the Neo-Impressionists ("New Impressionists"). His most famous paintings are "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" (18841886) in the Chicago and "Bathers at Asnières" (1884) in the National Gallery, London.
