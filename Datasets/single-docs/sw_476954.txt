Statutory rape

The term statutory rape means sexual activity with a minor that is not forced. It usually refers to when adults engage in sex with someone below the age of consent. In 95% of cases, the victim is female. Very few jurisdictions actually use the term "statutory rape". They use terms like "unlawful sex with a minor" or "unlawful carnal knowledge".
