Margaret Cruickshank

Dr Margaret Barnett Cruickshank (1 January 1873 â€“ 28 November 1918) was the first registered woman doctor in New Zealand.

Cruickshank studied at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine and was the second woman, following Emily Siedeberg, in New Zealand to complete medical school. During World War I she planned the work of the Waimate Red Cross Fund. She died from the 1918 flu pandemic.

In 1923 a memorial statue was shown at Seddon Square in Waimate. The plinth was prepared by Daniel Berry and the statue was carved by William Trethewey. In 1948 the maternity room in Waimate Hospital was named after her.
