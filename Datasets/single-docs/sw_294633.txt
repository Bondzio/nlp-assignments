Wonderama

Wonderama was a long-running children's television program. It appeared on Metromedia-owned stations from 1955 to 1986. The show was made at WNEW-TV in New York City.

"Wonderama" also was run in five other markets in which Metromedia owned television stations, including WTTG in Washington D.C., KMBC-TV in Kansas City, KTTV in Los Angeles, WXIX-TV in Cincinnati and WTCN-TV in Minneapolis â€“ Saint Paul. The show ran three hours long, and later two hours on Sunday mornings. 


Despite the frequent turnover of hosts throughout the 1950s, "Wonderama" experienced its greatest viewership by way of one-time Baltimore kids' show host Bob McAllister, who replaced Sonny Fox as host in 1967 and remained host until 1977.

Each show's taping included "(but was not necessarily limited to)" education, music, audience participation, games, interviews and cartoon shorts. 
Each week, audience members received a package of parting gifts with some items, including:

McAllister sang the program's closing theme song. It was called "Kids Are People Too" ("wacka-doo, wacka-doo, wacka-doo"). This later became the show's title when it moved to ABC on Sunday mornings. 

Many stars from all genres of entertainment (music, movies, television, etc.) appeared on "Wonderama", including:

Beginning in 1980, a documentary/magazine show for children (and hosted by teens) ran on Sunday mornings on WNEW-TV. While this show maintained the "Wonderama" title, the show itself was nothing like the kids festival that it once was. This hour-long incarnation ran until 1983; reruns edited to 30 minutes aired from 1984 to 1986 on WNEW-TV/WNYW on Saturday mornings.
