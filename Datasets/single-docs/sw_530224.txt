Anti-austerity movement

The anti-austerity movement refers to the mobilization of street protests and grassroots campaigns that has happened across many countries, especially in Europe, since the onset of the worldwide Great Recession. 

Anti-austerity actions are different and ongoing. They continue as of the present day. The global Occupy movement has arguably been the most noticeable physical enactment of anti-austerity and populist sentiment.
