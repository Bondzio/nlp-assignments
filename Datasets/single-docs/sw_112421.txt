Geographic Names Information System

The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) contains name and location information about more than two million physical and cultural features in the United States of America and its Territories. GNIS was developed by the United States Geological Survey and the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.
