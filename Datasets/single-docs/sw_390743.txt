Millennium Force

Millennium Force is a steel giga roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When it opened on May 13, 2000, it was the world's first giga roller coaster at 310 feet tall. It was also the world's tallest and fastest roller coaster for a short time until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later that year. It is also the second longest roller coaster in North America after The Beast at Kings Island.
