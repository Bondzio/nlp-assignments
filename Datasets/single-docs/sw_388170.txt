Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)

The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35 is a work for solo violin and orchestra. It was written by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1878. It was first performed in Vienna, Austria, on 4 December 1881. John Warrack writes, "Both the principal themes of [the] first movement are tender and eloquent ... With the Canzonetta that replaced the original Andante [Tchaikovsky] turns towards pure song ... the Finale [is] a cheerful little folk-like theme."
