Box office bomb

The term box office bomb (or box office flop) usually means a movie that is not very successful or does not make much money.

One example of a box office bomb is the action-thriller "Money Train" (released in November 1995). That movie made only $9 million above its $68 million overall budget.

Another box office bomb was "Cutthroat Island", which was released in December 1995. That movie cost $98 million, but took in only $10,017,322 at the box office.
