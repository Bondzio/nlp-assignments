Nipple

The nipple is a special structure. Female mammals (and women) use nipples for breastfeeding. The breast in male and female mammals is made the same way. The production of milk for breastfeeding is controlled by hormones. This means that men cannot use their breasts to produce milk (unless they have a problem with their hormones).
