Dwight Howard

Dwight Howard (born December 8, 1985) is a professional basketball player. He plays for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His position is center. The Magic chose Howard with the first pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. Howard did not play college basketball. He entered the draft right out of high school. Howard is one of the greatest rebounders and defensive players in the history of basketball. He is the NBA's active leader in offensive rebounds, total rebounds and blocked shots.

Howard has been chosen as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year three times, and won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 2008. Howard was also named to the All-NBA First Team three times, was an All-Star five times, and won a gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

He showed frustration at the end of 2011-12 NBA season and demanded a trade to either the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers or Dallas Mavericks. On August 10, 2012, he was traded from the Magic to the Los Angeles Lakers in a trade that also involved the Philadelphia 76ers and Denver Nuggets.
