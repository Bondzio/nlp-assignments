Miyagi Prefecture

Miyagi Prefecture used to be part of Mutsu Province. That province was in the northern part of Honshu. It was made from land taken from the indigenous Emishi. The province became the largest as it expanded to the north. The ancient capital was in modern Miyagi Prefecture.
During the Sengoku period, various clans ruled different parts of the province. Date Masamune was a close ally of the Tokugawa. He established Sendai, which is now the largest town of the Tōhoku region.

In the Meiji period, four new provinces were created from parts of Mutsu: Rikuchū, Rikuzen, Iwaki, and Iwashiro. In 1871, Sendai Prefecture was formed. It was renamed Miyagi prefecture the following year.

On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and major tsunami hit Miyagi Prefecture. It caused major damage to the area. The tsunami was about 10 meters high in parts of Miyagi Prefecture.

Sendai was the castle town of the daimyo Date Masamune. The remains of Sendai Castle are on a hill above the city.
