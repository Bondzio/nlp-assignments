Konstantin Stanislavski

Konstantin Sergeievich Stanislavski ("n√©" Alexeiev; ; 7 August 1938) was a seminal Russian theatre practitioner. He was widely known as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed created a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his 'system' of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.
