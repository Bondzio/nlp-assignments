Dorothy Eaton

Dorothy Eaton (? - probably no later than 1624) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. She was John Carver's maidservant. Her maiden name is unknown. William Bradford wrote of Carver's maidservant, "[she] married, and died a year or two after here in this place." She may have been Francis Eaton's second wife. A 1626 apprenticeship record from Bristol, England, mentions Francis Eaton, carpenter in New England, and his wife Dorothy.
