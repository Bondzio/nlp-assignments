Hurricane Hattie

Hurricane Hattie was a very powerful and deadly Atlantic storm in the western Caribbean Sea in autumn 1961. The storm struck Belize and parts of nearby countries, killing more than 300. This hurricane, because of how strong it was, would have been a Category Five on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The name Hattie was later retired.
