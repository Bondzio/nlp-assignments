Allan Holdsworth

Allan Holdsworth (6 August 1946 â€“ 15 April 2017) was a British guitarist and composer. He was best known for his work in jazz fusion.

Holdsworth was known for his knowledge of music, through which he created works in chord progressions and solos. His unique legato soloing technique came from his desire to originally play the saxophone. He also become associated with playing an early form of guitar synthesizer called the SynthAxe, a company which he worked for in the 1980s.

Holdsworth has been called as an influence by such renowned rock, metal and jazz guitarists as Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Shawn Lane, and Alex Lifeson.

Frank Zappa once called him as "one of the most interesting guys on guitar on the planet", while Robben Ford has said: "I think Allan Holdsworth is the John Coltrane of the guitar. I don't think anyone can do as much with the guitar as Allan Holdsworth can."

Holdsworth died on 15 April 2017 in Vista, California of a heart attack at the age of 70.
