Red-and-green macaw

The red-and-green macaw ("Ara chloropterus"), is a large mostly-red macaw of the "Ara" genus. This is the largest bird of the "Ara" genus. It is commonly found in the forests and woodlands of northern and central South America. They are found in flocks of 30 or more birds in the lowland areas. On forested slopes they form smaller flocks of two to three pairs. The flock roosts in trees at night. During the day they fly long distances to find fruit and seeds to eat. They spend a good part of the day resting, noisily arguing among themselves. Like other macaws, in recent years there has been a decline in its numbers due to habitat loss. They are hunted for food, feathers or are illegally captured for the parrot trade.
