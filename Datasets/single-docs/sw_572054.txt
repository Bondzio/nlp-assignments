Stefán Karl Stefánsson

Stefán Karl Stefánsson (born 10 July 1975) is an Icelandic actor. He is best known for his role as villain Robbie Rotten in the television programme "LazyTown" (2004–2007; 2013–2014). He was born in Hafnarfjörður.

Stefán said that he had pancreatic cancer in October 2016. A GoFundMe campaign has made $115,000 of the $100,000 goal after gaining an increase in popularity from internet memes. On June 21, his wife posted on Facebook that the pancreatic cancer has once again metastasized and has reached Stage IV. She states in her post, "Although the chances and statistics are not in our favor, and Stefán's candle burns quickly, we will not be scared of fear."

On 11 August 2017, Stefánsson was announced as cured from cancer in an interview with RÚV.
