Stomata

In botany, a stoma (also "stomate"; plural stomata) is a tiny opening or pore that is used for gas exchange. They are mostly found on the under-surface of plant leaves. In a stoma, there is the chloroplast, a cell wall, a vacuole and a cell nucleus.

Air enters the plant through these openings. The carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis. Some of the oxygen produced is used in respiration. Surplus oxygen exits through these same openings. Also, water vapor goes into the atmosphere through these pores in transpiration.

The pore is formed by a pair of cells known as guard cells. These adjust the size of the opening by opening or closing. To open a guard cell, protons (hydrogen ions, H) are pumped into the guard cells. Water enters them, the cells get hard, and they push open.
