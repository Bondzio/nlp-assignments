Arthur Dove

Arthur Garfield Dove (August 2, 1880 â€“ November 23, 1946) was an American artist. An early American modernist, he was the first American abstract painter to be shown publicly. In recent years it has become clear that Manierre Dawson was probably slightly ahead of Dove and Kandinsky in producing pure abstracts.
