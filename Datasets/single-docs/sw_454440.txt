Fishing reel

A fishing reel is a device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and unwinding fishing line. 

Modern fishing reels are designed to help in casting for distance and accuracy. Reels also retrieve line, usually with a handle. Fishing reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of angling. They are also used in the sport of competitive casting. Reels are usually attached to a fishing rod by some means. However specialized reels are made to be mounted directly to the boat gunwales or transoms. 

The first writing describing a fishing reel is from about 1100 years ago in China. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 AD. By the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising gear-retrieved reels. An American watchmaker and inventor, George W. Snyder, invented the first gear multiplying reel abut 1810.
