4: The Remix

4: The Remix is an extended play (EP) by American R&B singer Beyoncé. It was released through Columbia Records on April 23, 2012. Before the release of the EP, Beyoncé organised a remix competition for her then-upcoming single "End of Time". The remix was chosen by a judging panel. The winner of the contest was Radzimir "Jimek" Dębski. 4 is a megapop album with a number of A-list guest stars. The guests include Kanye West and André 3000. Writers and producers include Rodney Jerkins, Tricky Stewart, Frank Ocean, Diplo and Switch. 

Metacritic gave "4" a generally positive 73 score. The New York Times pointed out that other recording artists could have released some of these songs. "Most of '4,' though, no one else could get away with, or would even want to try." Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote "It’s also her fourth-best album, as in her worst." The album is "heavy on ballads and midtempo tracks" according to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot.
