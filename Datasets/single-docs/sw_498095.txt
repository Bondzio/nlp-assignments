Häagen-Dazs

Häagen-Dazs is a brand of ice cream. They have franchises in the United States and many other countries around the world. Häagen-Dazs was created in 1961 by Reuben and Rose Mattus in The Bronx, New York. They opened their first store on November 15, 1976 in Brooklyn.

The "Häagen-Dazs" name was invented by Mattus since it was "Danish-sounding". He used it as a tribute to Denmark's good treatment of Jews during World War II. An outline of Denmark was also used on their early labels. The name is not Danish.

In 1983, Häagen-Dazs was bought by Pillsbury. Pillsbury was then bought by General Mills in 2001.
