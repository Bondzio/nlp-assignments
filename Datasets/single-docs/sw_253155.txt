Sulphate

In chemistry, a sulphate (sulfate in US English) is a salt of sulphuric acid. The sulphate ion is a group of atoms with the formula SO and two negative charges. It consists of a central sulphur atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms. It occurs when sulfuric acid is deprotonated twice. If it is only deprotonated once, the hydrogen sulfate ion is made.
