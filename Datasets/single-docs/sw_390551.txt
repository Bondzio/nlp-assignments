Pope Gregory VI

Pope Gregory VI (; died 1048), born Johannes Gratianus, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 149th Pope from 1 May 1045 until his abdication on 20 December 1046.

Johannes Gratianus was born in Rome, but the date of his birth is not known. 

Gratianus became pope in 1045; and he took the name Gregory. There was a problem in the way he became pope. 

Gregory VI willingly resigned; and then he retired to a monastery.

Hildebrand was the papal chaplain. This priest stayed with the former pope until his death in Cologne.
