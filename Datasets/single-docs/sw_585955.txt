Christian Eschatology

Eschatology is a branch of Christian Theology. At large Eschathology consists on a series of studies on the Ultimate Destiny of Humanity and Human Soul as it is written in the Bible. 

Eschatology is concerned with the final events in history and it's most relevant studies are about Death, Life after Death, Resurrection of the Death and Final Judgement.

Etymology: The word Eschatology arises from two greek notions (eschatos) meaning "last" and (logy) meaning "the a study of", and was first used in English around 1844.
