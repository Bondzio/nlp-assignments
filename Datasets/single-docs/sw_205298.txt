Cynognathus

Cynognathus was a cynodont (a mammal-like reptile, not a dinosaur) that was the size of a wolf. This therapsid lived on open plains during the early to middle Triassic period, roughly 230-245 million years ago. It was probably warm-blooded and may have given birth to live young. Fossils have been found in South Africa and Argentina.
