2013–14 NHL season

The 2013–14 NHL season was the 97th season of operation (96th season of play) of the National Hockey League (NHL). 

This season had a realignment. The league's 30 teams changed from six divisions to four divisions. The regular season began October 1 and ended April 13. The 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs began April 16.

There was no all-star game this season, due to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Prior to the season, the NHL, International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and Olympic officials reached an agreement to send NHL players to the Olympics game. The league took a break on February 9 and resumed play on February 25.

The new divisions are:

Western Conference
Eastern Conference
