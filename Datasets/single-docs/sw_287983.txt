Sievert

The Sievert, abbreviated "Sv" is the SI unit to measure the equivalent dose of ionizing radiation. It looks at how an organism reacts to a given dose. This is different from measuring the total absorbed dose, which is done in gray. It is named after Rolf Sievert, a Swedish physicist and doctor, who did research on how radiation affects organisms.
