Enzo Fortuny

Enzo Favio Fortuny (born June 7, 1981 in Veracruz, Mexico) is a Latin American voice actor. He is always credited as "Enzo Fortuny". While he remains as a specialist in young men's voices, his range is ample enough to allow him to portray either gentler roles (like Yukito Tsukishiro) or much rougher ones (like InuYasha). He is the Latin American Disney XD channel speaker and the official Latin American Dub-over artists of Drake Bell and Elijah Wood.
