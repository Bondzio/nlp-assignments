Melaleuca leucadendra

Melaleuca leucadendra is a tree which belongs to the "Melaleuca" genus. It is largely distributed in the northern parts of Australia (Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland). It is also found further north in the Solomon Islands and in New Guinea. The "Melaleuca leucadendra" is similar to the "Broad-leaf Paperbark" ("Melaleuca quinquenervia"), which has a thick spongy bark. However, the "Melaleuca leucadendra"'s foliage is of a brighter green and it has a slightly weeping habit.

"Melaleuca leucadendra" is also given the common name Cajuput Tree, which is derived from the Malay word "kayu putih" (old Indonesian spelling: "kaju putih") - meaning "white wood". Cajuput oil can be distilled from its leaves.
