LGBT rights in the Republic of China

The Republic of China (Taiwan) is one of Asia's most tolerant countries as far as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights are concerned. The government proposed a same-sex marriage in 2003 which has so far stalled without passage. If the law passes, the ROC would be the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriages. The ROC is also described as the most liberal after over 30,000 people went to the Taiwan Pride parade in 2010 and 2011, making it the largest LGBT event in Asia.
