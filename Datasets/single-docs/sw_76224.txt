East End of London

The East End of London, known locally as the East End, generally refers to the area of central London, England, east of the medieval walled City of London and north of the River Thames. It is cheaper to live in than the West End, so it has had many immigrants over the years, including Huguenot, Irish, Jews and more recently Bengalis.
