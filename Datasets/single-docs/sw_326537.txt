Comiskey Park

Comiskey Park was a baseball park in Chicago, Illinois. For more than 80 years, it was the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Chicago White Sox. It opened in the middle of the 1910 baseball season, and closed after the end of the 1990 season. It was replaced by the park now known as Guaranteed Rate Field, which was built across the street to the south of Comiskey Park. The old ballpark was made of steel, concrete and bricks. Tearing it down was a slow process. It took all summer of 1991 to finish the job.
