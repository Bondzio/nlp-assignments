The American Crisis

The American Crisis is a series of pamphlets (short books) written by Thomas Paine. They were written during the American Revolutionary War. They begin with the quote, "these are the times that try men's souls". The first of the pamphlets was written after a series of losses to the British, and was meant to keep the patriots in the fight.
