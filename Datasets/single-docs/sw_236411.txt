Samoyed (dog)

The Samoyed is a dog breed that are usually white in color but they can be grey or cream too. They can get between 2-3 feet in height. The Samoyed breed is known for having a curled tail, much like a Husky. They have a thick coat of fur to protect them from the cold because they were used to drag slays in the cold. Samoyeds are really friendly, so they will not make good guard dogs because they are too cute and fluffy and are really friendly.
