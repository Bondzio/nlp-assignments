Klinefelter syndrome

Klinefelter syndrome, 47, XXY, or XXY syndrome is when people have an extra number of X chromosomes. People who have Klinefelter's Syndrome are often called "XXY Males", or "47, XXY Males". Other males can have Klinefelter's Syndrome as well (for example, mice). Males who have this condition are almost always infertile. This means that they cannot father babies.
