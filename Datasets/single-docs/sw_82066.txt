Empire State Building

The Empire State Building is a skyscraper in New York City, United States. It is 381 meters (1,250 feet) tall and has 102 floors, and the height to its pinnacle is 1,454 feet. Named after the popular nickname for New York, The Empire State, it is one of the most famous landmarks in the US.

Designed by the architects named Shreve, Lamb & Harmon Associates, it was built at a time when many people were trying to make the world's tallest building, but the Empire State Building won. It was completed in 410 days and United States President Herbert Hoover turned on the lights on May 1, 1931.

The Empire State Building became the tallest building in New York City and the world, holding this record for forty-one years until the first World Trade Center towers opened in 1973. When these towers were brought down in the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York. It lost this title in April 2013 when the new One World Trade Center surpassed it, which is now the tallest building in the US and the Western Hemisphere.
