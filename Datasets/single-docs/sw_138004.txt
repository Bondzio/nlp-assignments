Amazon Basin

The Amazon Basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its branches. It is low-lying in relation to sea level. 

The river has its origins high up in the Andes of Peru and Ecuador. Most of this drainage basin (54%) is in Brazil, including the lower part. The river also has tributaries from Colombia, Venezuela and Bolivia. The Amazon rainforest is the largest in the world, covering about 8,235,430Â km with dense tropical forest.

The Amazon Basin is one of the world's most important ecosystems.
