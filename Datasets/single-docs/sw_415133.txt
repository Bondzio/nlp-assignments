Latin dance

Latin dance is a general term for dance styles from the Americas and Spain. It is also a term for dances in the international latin dance syllabus: rumba, cha-cha-cha, samba, paso doble and jive.

Social latin dances include salsa, mambo, merengue, tumba, bachata, bomba, plena, cumbia, and the Argentine tango. There are many dances which were popular in the first part of the 20th century, but which are now of only historical interest. The Cuban danz√≥n is a good example.
