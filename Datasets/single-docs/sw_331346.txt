Wolf Vostell

Wolf Vostell (14 October 1932â€“3 April 1998) was a German artist who made arts in many forms including sculpture, video art, and installations. He was an important artist in the second half of the 20th century. He believed that art should take place in the street, and that the audience should be involved. One of his works, called "130 kms per hour", was a crash between a train and a car.
