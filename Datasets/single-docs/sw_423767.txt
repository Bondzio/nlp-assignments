Óðr

In Norse mythology, Óðr (sometimes written in English as Odr or Od) is a man associated with the goddess Freyja. The "Prose Edda" and "Heimskringla", both by Snorri Sturluson, describe Óðr as Freyja's husband. They also describe him as the father of Freyja's daughter Hnoss. "Heimskringla" adds that the couple had another daughter together, Gersemi.

Not much else is written about Óðr, except that he often went away on long journeys. Freyja wept when she missed him. Several scholars have suggested that Óðr may just have been another name for the god Odin.
