Howard Carter

Howard Carter (May 9, 1874 â€“ March 2, 1939) was an English archaeologist. He was the man who found King Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. Tutankhamun was a young pharaoh {in the middle kingdom} His mother was Martha Carter and his father was Samuel Carter.

The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb was an accident. Howard Carter's waterboy stumbled across some steps leading under the desert surface. Lady Carnarvon, a sponsor of Carter's work, was running low on patience at this point, and so if the discovery had not been made, then it is likely it would not have been discovered at all.
