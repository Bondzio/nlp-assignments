Liberia, Costa Rica

Liberia is the capital and largest city of Guanacaste province in Costa Rica. The city is northwest of the national capital, San José. Liberia is often called "la ciudad blanca" (the white city) by its residents because of the white gravel once used to make the city’s roads and the whitewashed colonial houses that once made up a large part of the city.
