Arabesque (ballet)

The ballet arabesque is one of the basic positions. It has been used since the 18th century. The dancer stands on one leg (the supporting leg) with the other leg (the working leg) turned out and extended behind the body. There are many variations on this figure which are described in the standard ballet technique books.
