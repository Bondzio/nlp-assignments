Mahmood

Mahmud (also spelled Mahmood, Mahmoud, Mahmut, Mehmood, Mahmoed or Mehmud) is the main transliteration of the Arabic given name (, "Maḥmūd") that comes from the Arabic triconsonantal root of Ḥ-M-D ""Praise"".

Despite sharing the same triconsonantal root, this name is distinct from the name "Muhammad". One of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's many names is "Mahmud".

The name is common in most parts of the Islamic world; it is used as a given name for males, while the variant "Mahmuda" is given to females.
