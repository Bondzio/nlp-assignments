Teasel is a plant in the genus Dipsacus. There are about 15 different species of teasel. These flowering plants are tall and leafy (herbaceous). They are biennial plants and are native to (come from) Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. They can grow to be tall.

These plants have a prickly stem and leaves. Its flowers are purple, dark pink, or lavender and grow directly on the end of the stem.
