Prayer

Prayer is an communication to God or another supernatural being. It is an important part of many religions. There is no conclusive evidence, but many believe their prayers are answered. Prayer is done by those who trust the power of word and thought. Many religions recognize the creation of the universe by God from words. Jesus taught people to say the Lord's Prayer.

Prayer can be spoken, silent (no talking), or in a song. It can be used to praise a god (including God) or to ask for something including help and forgiveness. Prayers can be said over and over again as in a Rosary or just once.
