Chinese river dolphin

The Chinese river dolphin ("Lipotes vexillifer") or baiji was a river dolphin. It was found only in the Yangtze River in China. The baiji was declared extinct in 2007 by the Chinese Academy of Science. Nobody exactly knows if baiji was really extinct because the last sighting(s) were in 2004.

The baiji was a graceful animal, with a long, narrow and slightly upturned beak and a flexible neck. As opposed to some other freshwater dolphins, like the Indus River dolphin, its eyes were functional, although greatly reduced. Its coloration was bluish-gray to gray above and white to ashy-white below. It weighed 135 - 230 kg (300 - 510 lb) and measured as much as 2.5 m (8.2') in length.

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) noted these threats to the species: 
Further studies have noted the environmental impact of building the Three Gorges Dam on the living space of the baiji.

It was the first dolphin species that humans have made extinct.
