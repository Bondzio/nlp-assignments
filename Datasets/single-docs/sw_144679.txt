Ur So Gay

"Ur So Gay" is a single released by Katy Perry. It was Perry's first major label release, and was later placed on her studio album "One of the Boys". At first the song was just meant for the internet.




The music video for "Ur So Gay" depicts Perry singing the song with animated clouds and grass surrounding her and her blue guitar. It occasionally cuts to a storyline featuring a Barbie version of Perry. The video was directed by Walter May.
