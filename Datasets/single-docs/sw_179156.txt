Mountain Dew

Mountain Dew is a citrus-flavored soft drink, made by the PepsiCo company. The drink has more "caffeine" (a stimulant) than other soft drinks like Pepsi and Coca-Cola. 

"Mountain Dew" was first a slang word for moonshine or homemade whisky. The name for the soft drink was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s.

This design lasted until the mid 1960s.
