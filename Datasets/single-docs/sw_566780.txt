Charlie Brotman

Charles J. "Charlie" Brotman (born December 30, 1927) is an American public relations specialist and public address announcer. He is known for his presentation of U.S. presidential inaugural parades of 11 presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Barack Obama.

Brotman has been behind the microphone for every inaugural parade in Washington, DC, since 1957, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was sworn in for his second term. Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013 was the 15th consecutive ceremony that Brotman has announced, and his 16th overall.

In 2017, President-Elect Donald Trump's Presidential Inauguration Committee said that Brotman will not broadcast his inauguration, ending his broadcasting streak.
