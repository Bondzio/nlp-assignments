Grand Theft Auto IV

Grand Theft Auto IV (GTA IV) is the 11th "Grand Theft Auto" game in the series. The game was made by Rockstar North, and was published and released by Rockstar Games for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions were released around the world to much hype on April 29th 2008, having received very good reviews from many reviewers.

"Grand Theft Auto IV" has the same basic gameplay from the earlier games in the series. The player can walk, run, swim, climb, jump and use weapons and basic hand-to-hand combat. Players can steal and drive many types of cars, boats, helicopters and motorcycles. Players can explore and choose how they want to play the game. Players can complete missions, but these are not needed to get farther into the game to open content. When the player does a crime and the police see it, they will start to follow the player and try to catch him.
