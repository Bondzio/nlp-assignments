Raymond Peter Allison (born March 4, 1959) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey forward who played 7 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Hartford Whalers and Philadelphia Flyers.

Following his junior career, Allison became the first draft pick in the history of the Hartford Whalers franchise. A year later, Allison was traded in a ten player trade to the Philadelphia Flyers. There he would develop into a scoring forward but suffered a broken ankle during the 1982â€“83 season. He never regained a regular spot on the Flyers roster, and played his last few seasons in the AHL and Swiss leagues.
