Wednesday Morning, 3 AM

Wednesday Morning, 3 AM is the name of the first album by Simon and Garfunkel. It came out in 1964. Some of the songs on the album were written by Paul Simon, but others were written by other people. The songs "Wednesday Morning, 3 AM", "The Sounds of Silence", "Bleecker Street" and Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin'" are on the album. The album did not sell well, though the song "The Sounds of Silence" was later released as a single.
