Troll 2

Troll 2 is a 1990 horror comedy movie, directed by Claudio Fragasso, under the pseudonym Drake Floyd. During production, the movie was known as Goblins, and some foreign releases of the movie were labeled as such, but upon release in the United States, the title was changed to "Troll 2" in an attempt to help sell the movie by connecting it to an established horror movie, the 1986 Empire Pictures movie "Troll". The two movies, however, have no connection apart from the title. In fact, despite the title, no actual trolls appear in "Troll 2".

This movie has a sequel, "Troll 3".
