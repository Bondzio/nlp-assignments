Division of East Sydney

The Division of East Sydney was a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales.
The division was created in 1900. It was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. It was abolished in 1969. It was named for the suburb of East Sydney. It was located in the inner eastern suburbs of Sydney, including Darlinghurst, Paddington and Surry Hills.

After 1910 East Sydney was usually a safe seat for the Australian Labor Party. In the 1930s it was a stronghold of Lang Labor. Its most famous members were Sir George Reid, who was Prime Minister of Australia in 1904-05, and Eddie Ward, a long-serving Labor member and Cabinet minister.
