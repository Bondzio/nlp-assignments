Alfa Romeo GTV (1995)

Alfa Romeo GTV (1995â€“2006) was a 2-door sportscar made in Italy by Alfa Romeo.

It was designed by Enrico Fumia (born 1948) of the Pininfarina design company.

GTV was a coupe with tiny rear seats. "GTV" means "Gran Turismo Veloce" (in Italian) and had a little space for luggage for longer trips. The cabriolet Spider had no back seat and almost no space for luggage. The engines were 1.8, 2, 3 and 3.2-liter. In 2003 the front looks were changed.

GTV was replaced in 2004 and 2005 by the Alfa Romeo GT and the Alfa Romeo Brera, and in 2006 the Brera "Spider".
