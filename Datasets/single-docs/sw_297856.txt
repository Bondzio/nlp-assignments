William John Wills

William John Wills (1834â€”1861) was an English surveyor. He was born in Totnes, Devon. He became one of the first explorers to cross Australia from the south to the north. The expedition became known as the Burke and Wills expedition. It ended in disaster, when both Wills and the leader, Robert O'Hara Burke, died from starvation at Cooper Creek on their return journey.
