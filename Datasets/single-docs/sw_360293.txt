Screen Two

Screen Two is a British television anthology drama series. It was produced by the BBC and transmitted on BBC2 between 1985 to 1994. 
It was developed by producer Kenith Trodd. It was popular enough with viewers for a BBC1 equivalent, "Screen One", which was launched in 1989.

However, the mid-1990s saw a change for BBC drama. They went away from single dramas toward drama series and serials. "Screen One" ended in 1993 and "Screen Two" in 1994. Movies from both strands are occasionally repeated on BBC Four.
