Avialae

Avialae is a term for birds and their immediate extinct ancestors. It is a clade of dinosaurs containing their only living representatives, birds, and whatever coelurosaurs are regarded as their ancestors.

Avialae is defined as clade based on physical characteristics. Jacques Gauthier named Avialae in 1986, and first defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them.

Several other authors use a similar, but branch-based, definition: all theropods closer to birds than to "Deinonychus".
