Peace and Truce of God

The Peace of God was a movement begun by bishops in southern France around 990 CE to limit the violence done to property and to the unarmed.

The Truce of God extended the Peace by setting aside certain days of the week when violence was not allowed. Where the Peace of God limited violence against the church and the poor, the Truce of God was about preventing fighting between Christians, especially knights.
