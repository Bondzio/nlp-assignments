Synthetic genomics

Synthetic genomics is a type of genetic engineering. It makes genes which never occur in nature.

Synthetic genomics does not use naturally occurring genes. It may use custom-designed base pair series. In the future, it might use genetic codes that are not composed of the two base pairs of DNA currently used by life forms.

The development of synthetic genomics uses technical abilities and technologies in the field of genetics. Researchers can make long base pair chains cheaply and accurately on a large scale. This allows them to do experiments on genomes which do not exist in nature. They also use ideas in protein folding and high-end computing facilities. 

The J. Craig Venter Institute has assembled a quasi-synthetic "Mycoplasma genitalium" bacterial genome by recombination of 25 overlapping fragments in a single step: 

Other companies, including one called Synthetic Genomics, have been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.
