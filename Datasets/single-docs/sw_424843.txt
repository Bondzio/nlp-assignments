Canaletto

Giovanni Antonio Canal (17 or 18 October 1697 â€“ 19 April 1768) was an Italian painter from Venice. Today, he is mostly remembered for his landscape paintings. Some of these landscape paintings which resemble the views found on modern-day postcards are known as Vedutes today. He was also an important printmaker in etching.
