Bougainvillea

Bougainvillea is a genus of flowering plants. Bougainvilleas first came from South America. They are climbing plants grown for decoration in tropical countries, and in the southern United States. Farther north, the plants are grown in greenhouses. The bougainvillea is named for the French navigator Louis-Autoine de Bougainville.

Bougainvillea, a tropical vine known for the beauty of the large, colorful bracts (modified leaves) which surround its flowers. The flowers are small and plain. The bracts may be magenta, purple, yellow, or crimson, and are one inch (2.5 cm) or more long. One common type of bougainvillea has a climbing stem that sometimes reaches a length of 100 feet (30 m).
