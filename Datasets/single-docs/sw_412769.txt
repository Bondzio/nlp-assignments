Count of Anjou

Count of Anjou was a title first given to Ingelger. His male line ended with Geoffrey II of Anjou. The next line of counts of Anjou were descended from Geoffrey's sister Ermengarde-Blanche and her husband Geoffrey II, Count of GÃ¢tinais. Their descendants include the Plantagenet kings of England.



In 1204, Anjou was lost to king Philip II of France. It was re-granted as an appanage for Louis VIII's son John. He died in 1232 at the age of thirteen. Anjou was then given to Louis's youngest son, Charles. He later became the king of Sicily.


In 1290, Margaret married Charles of Valois, the younger brother of king Philip IV of France. He became Count of Anjou in her right.
