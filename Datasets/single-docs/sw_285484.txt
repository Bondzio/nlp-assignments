Socorro dove

The Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni) is a dove that now cannot be found in the wild. In captivity, there are not more than some 200 and probably fewer than 100 purebred birds. Because of this, a reintroduction program is being prepared.

It is a close relative of the mourning and eared doves, particularly the former. It was at one time considered a subspecies of the mourning dove.
