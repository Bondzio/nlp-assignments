Tell Me Something I Don't Know

"Tell Me Something I Don't Know" is a song by Selena Gomez. It was released as a single on August 5, 2008 on iTunes. A Radio Disney version (which removes the Hurricane Katrina reference) was released on September 9, 2008, on iTunes. The song is on the Kidz Bop 15 CD. A new version of the song is on Selena Gomez & the Scene's debut album, "Kiss & Tell".

The song peaked at number 58 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart at 13 on the Australian Hitseekers Singles chart and at 1 on the Malaysia Muzik Singles & Urban Chart.

The music video starts with scenes reminiscent of (but not from) the film; Gomez cleaning a house and the maid yelling at her. Gomez then leaves the house and does a dance routine with her backup dancers, while the maid watches from the house window. The video also features Gomez in front of a black background with lyrics from the song (such as "I'm ready for it" and "One in a million") flying around her.
