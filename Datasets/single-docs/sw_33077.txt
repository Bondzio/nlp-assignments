Bacillus

Bacillus is a genus of rod shaped bacteria. They are Gram-positive, meaning they have an extra outside cell layer.

Bacilli are partly or wholly aerobic. They do aerobic respiration. They are everywhere in nature. "Bacillus" includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species. 

Under stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods.

Some species of "Bacillus" are worth noting:
