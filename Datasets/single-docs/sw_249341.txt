Desert scorpion

The desert scorpion is "Hadrurus arizonensis", the largest scorpion in North America.

Scorpions are arachnids, with eight legs. Their body has two body parts, called abdomen and cepholothorax.

The desert scorpion’s habitat is the desert. It is a warm place where the hottest days can reach 120 degrees. Desert scorpions range is south west. In extreme weather conditions, the extra layer of fat under scorpion’s exoskeleton helps it to survive. It lives in sandy places in the desert like sand dunes.

It is a burrowing scorpion, but often found under rocks. Its diet consists of large insects, spiders, and small vertebrates. This is an aggressive and active scorpion. Like all scorpions, it is nocturnal. Also like all scorpions, the giant desert hairy scorpion gives birth to live young, which stay on the mother's back for a week or more before leaving.
