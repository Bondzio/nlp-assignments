Secret Intelligence Service

The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly known as MI6, is the United Kingdom's intelligence agency which collects intelligence about foreign countries. It is a branch of the Foreign Service, and reports to the Joint Intelligence Committee.

The service was formed in 1909 as the Secret Service Bureau, but its existence was not officially acknowledged until 1994. 

The service works with the Security Service (MI5), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the Defence Intelligence (DIS). SIS deal with the United Kingdom's espionage (spying) activities outside the United Kingdom.

The service has had its headquarters at Vauxhall Cross in London since 1995.
