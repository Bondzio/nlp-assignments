Type 95 75 mm field gun

The was a field gun of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). It was used during World War II. 

This artillery piece was planned to replace the Type 38 75 mm field gun and the Type 41 75 mm cavalry gun in front line combat. However, Type 38s continued to be used.

Before World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army mainly had Krupp cannons from Germany. After the Versailles Treaty, the Japanese considered other options including field guns designed by Schneider et Cie from France. 

In 1931, IJA began to use the "Type 90" which was based on Schneider designs; however, the Type 90 was not considered successful.

The Type 95s were simpler and more sturdy than the Type 90s.

Type 95s were used in the Second Sino-Japanese War.
