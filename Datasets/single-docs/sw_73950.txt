McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II

The F-4 Phantom II was an American fighter-bomber. It was mainly used during the Vietnam War. It was first flown in 1958 and was shown in 1960. The plane could carry four AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles and four long range AIM-7 Sparrow missiles, but it did not have a gun. Later, the E model had a cannon mounted on it. After the F-15 Eagle replaced it, it was used as a bomber and the G model was used as a Wild Weasel.
