Mathias Grünewald

Mathias Grünewald (born between 1475 and 1480 in Würzburg, died 31 August 1528) was a German painter and artist. Today he is seen as one of the important German artists of the Renaissance. His real name was "Mathias Gothart" or "Mathias Neidhardt", his first name is also spelled "Mathis". Sometimes he is called Mathias of Aschaffenburg. Today, only ten paintings and 35 drawings survive. At first many of his works were attributed to Albrecht Dürer, even though Dürer's style of paining is completely different. All the surviving works have religious motifs.
