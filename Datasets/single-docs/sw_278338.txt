When the Pawn...

When the Pawn... is a 1999 album by Fiona Apple. The following poem is the full title of the album:

"When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king<br>
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight<br>
And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring<br>
There's no body to batter when your mind is your might<br>
So when you go solo, you hold your own hand<br>
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights<br>
And if you know where you stand, then you know where to land<br>
And if you fall it won't matter, cause you'll know that you're right" When it was released it had the world record the longest album title.

Three singles were released from the album: "Fast as You Can", "Limp", and "Paper Bag". "Paper Bag" was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the 43rd Grammy Awards (2001).

The album got good reviews. Pitchfork gave it a score of 8.0.

The Japanese edition of the album had "Across the Universe" and "Never is a Promise [live]" as bonus tracks.
