Grade (education)

Grades are a teacher's evaluation of a student's performance. They are often letters (e.g. A, B, C, D, F,) or numbers (e.g. 1-10.), although in some countries they do not use either of these systems.

Letter grades are most commonly used in the United States and some others. The grades D or C are usually enough to pass.

Grades can also be on a number scale. Typically a midpoint score is a pass. Sometimes the numbers can go in descending order to indicate better performance.

A "Grade Point Average", or GPA, takes the grade(s) of a student and assigns point values to them. These points are added up and divided to calculate the GPA.
