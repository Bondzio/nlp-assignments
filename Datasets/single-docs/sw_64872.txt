Family Guy

Family Guy is an American adult animated comedy television series created by Seth MacFarlane. It first was shown on FOX in 1999. The series did not become popular until shown again on Cartoon Network and TBS, and episodes were sold on DVD & Blu-ray. Fox chose to cancel the series because it was not very popular. After many DVDs were sold, Fox started showing it again on May 1, 2005. It is aimed at adults.

The series is about the lives of Peter Griffin, his wife Lois, and their three children: 19-year old Meg, 16-year old Chris, and very smart 3-year-old Stewie; and also their dog, 27-year old Brian, who talks and acts like a human. The Griffins live in a fictional city named "Quahog", Rhode Island. The show puts humor into common everyday situations and is famous for their style of comedy that always makes fun of past American culture. These scenes are called "cutaway gags", because they have unrelated stories, and they do not affect the show's stories in any way. The show also uses a lot of profanity and sex scenes. Brian died later on the show and was replaced by an Italian-accent talking dog, Vinny, but he returned after two episodes.



In 2009, a spin off show from "Family Guy" was created called "The Cleveland Show" with Cleveland Brown as the main character.


The series was nominated for many Emmy Awards. Family Guy is the first animated series to be nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Comedy Series since "The Flintstones" in 1961.
