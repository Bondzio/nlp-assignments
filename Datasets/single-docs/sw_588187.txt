Brahmo Samaj

As we all know that during the 19th century there prevailed various social and religious evils in the Indian society and to reform the society various "samajs" were formed like the Prathna Samaj, Satay Shodak Samaj, Theosophical society etc. and one of them was the Brahmo Samaj. It was founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in A.D. 1828. It can also be said as the first attempt by the Indians to reform their religion removing the various evils it had. While under Keshab Chandra Sen it was able to make great progress and set up many branches across India. The Brahma Samaj helped a lot in reforming the Indian society. Few of the many things it did were to end up sati, opposing worship of many Gods, costly sacrifices and meaningless rituals, propose the theory that God is omnipresent, promoting inter-caste and widow remarriage ,opposing child marriage and polygamy etc.
