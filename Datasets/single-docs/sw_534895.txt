De Moivre's formula

In mathematics, de Moivre's formula, named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number "z" and integer "n", 

formula_1

where formula_2 is the modulus of "z", and formula_3 is the argument of "z". Here, formula_4 is Euler's number, with formula_5 often being called the polar form of a complex number.

The formula is very important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry. It can be easily proved using the trigonometry form of complex numbers, induction, and some trigonometrical identities. Furthermore, using this formula any equation of formula_6, where "w" is complex, can be solved.
