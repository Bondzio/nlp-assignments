Maynard Solomon

Maynard Solomon (born January 5, 1930) is an American writer and a former music producer. He was a co-founder of Vanguard Records, and later became a writer on music.

Maynard Solomon started Vanguard Records with his brother Seymour Solomon, in 1950. The label was popular for folk music and blues for the next fifteen years. As well as producing many albums, he wrote many liner notes.

Solomon won the rights to record and release music from the Newport Folk Festival. This meant he could release recordings by artists who had not actually signed with Vanguard. At this time, Elektra was the main label for folk artists. Their singers, Phil Ochs and Judy Collins, were recorded at Newport, as was a Columbia artist, Bob Dylan.

In 1960, he signed Joan Baez. In the late 60's Vanguard had some success with rock artists, One of these was "Country Joe and the Fish" (today usually called Country Joe McDonald),
