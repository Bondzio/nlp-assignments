War crime

A war crime is a crime that happens in context of or associated with war. There are international laws of war that say what people can do during wars and what they cannot do. A war crime breaks these rules. 

Today, these rules are international laws called the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Convention.

To be a war crime, a crime must be part of a plan, or the crime has to be committed against many people.

The idea of what a "war crime" is has changed over time. For example, during World War I, using poison gas in combat was not thought of as a war crime. Now it is.

In 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was created. Its goal is to look into and, if possible, punish people for war crimes. When the ICC was created, it came up with a longer list of war crimes. For example, its list was the first one to include types of sexual abuse like forcing women into sexual slavery.

Here are some examples of crimes that the ICC lists as war crimes.

These are war crimes whether they are committed against enemy soldiers or civilians or neutral persons.
