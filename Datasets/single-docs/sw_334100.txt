Maribyrnong River Viaduct

The Maribyrnong River Viaduct (also known as the Quarter Mile Bridge) is a railway bridge across the Maribyrnong River in the western suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. It is near the E.J. Whitten Bridge, and almost 400 metres long (hence the quarter mile name). The Albion-Jacana railway line uses the bridge, which is mainly used for freight. It also carries the Melbourne to Sydney CountryLink XPT. It is the second highest bridge in Victoria, only behind the West Gate Bridge (58 metres). At a height of 180 feet (54.86 m) above the water, it is even higher than the Sydney Harbour Bridge (52 metres). The bridge is 1257 feet (383.13 m) long

It was built in 1927â€“29 by the Victorian Railways Construction Branch, being the largest trestle bridge in Australia when completed in June, 1929. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and employed 200 people during construction, with one fatality.
