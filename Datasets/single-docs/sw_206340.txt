Young-adult fiction

Young-adult fiction (often abbreviated as YA) is fiction written for, made for, or sold to adolescents and young adults, around the ages of 14 to 21. 

Young-adult fiction in the form of novels or short stories, have special features that make it different from the other age groups of fiction: Adult fiction, Middle Grade Fiction, and Children's Fiction. Most YA stories show an adolescent as the lead character, rather than an adult or a child. The subject matter and storylines are usually in line with the age and knowledge of the main character. YA stories can span all types of fiction. The settings of YA stories are limited only by the skill of the author. YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth. The entire age category is sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novel. YA novels are often as short as 16000 words. Despite its unique features, YA shares the basic parts of fiction with other stories: character, plot, setting, theme, and style.
