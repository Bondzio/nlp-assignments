From 1958 to 1960, Teller worked as the director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He was the associate director until 1977. The laboratory is now called Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

In 1979 Teller had a heart attack. He blamed it on Jane Fonda. In 1982 he became a member of the White House Science Council.

Teller was given one of the first Ig Nobel Prizes for Peace in 1991. In 2000 Teller's wife died.

In 2001 a book Teller wrote about his life, "Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey In Science And Politics", was published by Basic Books. Teller was 93.
