Germany's Next Topmodel (also known as GNTM) is a television show hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum. The first cycle (season) was in 2006. The 8th cycle finished showing in May 2013. 

A group of girls are chosen to live together for a few weeks and compete to become "Germany's Next Topmodel". Each week, one girl is asked to leave because she is not good enough to stay in the competition and become a top model. The last three/four girls are in the finale. The winner is then chosen with help of the group of judges. There have been 8 cycles of the show so far.
