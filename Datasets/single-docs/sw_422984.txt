Wolseley Expedition

The Wolseley Expedition was a military force put together to capture the Canadian MÃ©tis leader Louis Riel. It was led by Colonel Garnet Wolsely. The expedition took place in 1870 and went from Toronto to Winnipeg. Because of the fact that the expedition had to carry so much equipment and guns, the Wolsely Expedition is thought to be one of the most difficult in all of recent history.
