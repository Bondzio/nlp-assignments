Alkaline battery

An alkaline battery is a primary cell (it cannot be recharged). It is very common. Duracell, Rayovac, and Energizer are common brands of alkaline batteries. They have replaced the Leclanche battery as the "everyday battery". They are marketed in many forms, such as AAA, AA, C, D, 9V, and little tiny cells for watches and calculators. In the battery, zinc is oxidized by manganese dioxide in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.
