Endive

Endive ("Chicorium endivia") is a leafy plant of the family Asteraceae. People think it came from either Egypt or Indonesia and it has been grown for humans to eat since the 16th century. There are many varieties, but they can be split into two groups: the curly-leaved. or narrow-leaved endive, used for cooking, and the Batavian or broad-leaved endive, used for salads.
