Bold (type)

In formatting, bold makes a text become darker and a little bigger. It is used to emphasize a few words as a bolded text can attract attention from the reader.

To make a word bold, there are different ways in doing so. They are listed below
In HTML, the codice_1 and the codice_1 tags are used to surround the text that needs to be bolded.

In Wikitext, an editor can bold a text using three apostrophes (codice_1) around the text to be bolded to produce the same results.
