Witold Kiełtyka

Witold "Vitek" Kiełtyka (January 24, 1984 – November 2, 2007) was a Polish musician. He was best known as the drummer and percussionist for the Polish technical death metal Decapitated. He was also the younger brother of bandmate Wacław "Vogg" Kiełtyka. Besides Decapitated, Kiełtyka also worked for the death metal bands, Dies Irae and Panzer X.

On October 29, 2007, while the band was traveling to a show in Gomel, Belarus, they and the other band that was on the tour bus, Crionics, were involved in an accident. The tour bus that was carrying the two bands, hit a truck that was carrying wood. The accident left both Kiełtyka and Adrian Kowanek with serious head injuries.

Both Kiełtyka and Adrian Kowanek were rushed to a hospital in Novozybkov, Russia. On November 1, 2007, Kiełtyka's family released a statement that said that his condition had improved. He underwent trepanation and was supposed to be transported to a hospital in Kraków, Poland, for further treatment. However, on November 2, 2007, Kiełtyka died from his injuries at the age of 23.
