Thames River (Connecticut)

The Thames River, not to be confused with the River Thames, is a short river in the U.S. state of Connecticut. It flows south for through eastern Connecticut. It goes from the joining of the Yantic and Shetucket rivers at Norwich to New London and Groton. The mouth is at the Long Island Sound. 

Two historic forts that are now Connecticut State Parks are on the mouth of the river which forms New London habor. Fort Griswold is on the eastern Groton Heights. Fort Trumbull is on the New London side.
