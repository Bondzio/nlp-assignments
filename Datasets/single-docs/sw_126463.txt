Duffy

Amiee Ann Duffy (born 23 June 1984), usually known as just Duffy, is a Welsh singer-songwriter. Her first album, "Rockferry", sold more than 6.5 million copies. "Rockferry", and a song from the album, "Mercy", both reached number one on the UK music charts. Her second album did not sell very well, with only 200,000 sold in the UK. In 2009 she made an advertisement for Diet Coke. The ad caused problems because she is shown riding a bicycle at night without a helmet or lights. Journalist Luke Lewis described the ad as "...blank, sterile and mildly unsettling."
