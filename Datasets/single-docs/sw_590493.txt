Choi Eun-hee

Choi Eun-hee (born November 20, 1926) is a South Korean actress. She began her movie career in 1947 in the movie "A New Oath". For the next 20 years, she was one of the biggest stars in Korean movies and led the Shin Film company along with her husband, the director Shin Sang-ok. She was born in Gwangju, Gyeonggi.

In 1978, Choi and Shin, whom she had recently divorced due to Shin having committed adultery, were kidnapped in Hong Kong to North Korea by order of Kim Jong-il. Kim's plan was to have Shin work as his propagandist and for Choi to be the star. Shortly after agreeing to the demands of Kim, they were remarried at his recommendation. The couple finally staged their escape in 1986 while on a trip to Vienna, fleeing to the United States embassy and requesting political asylum.

According to the Internet Movie Database, from 1955 to 1985, Choi appeared in eighty-one movies. She received the award for best actress at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival in 1985, for her part in the movie "Sogum".
