Tove Jansson

Tove Marika Jansson (; 9 August 1914 â€“ 27 June 2001) was a Swedish-born Finnish novelist, painter, illustrator and comic strip author. For her contribution as a children's writer she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1966.

Jansson is best known as the author of the "Moomin" books for children. The first such book, "The Moomins and the Great Flood", appeared in 1945, though it was the next two books, "Comet in Moominland" and "Finn Family Moomintroll", published in 1946 and 1948 respectively, that brought her fame.

Jansson died in Helsinki, Finland from natural causes at the age of 86.
