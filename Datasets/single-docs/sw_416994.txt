Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria

Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria () is an opera in a prologue and five acts (later revised to three acts). The music was written by Claudio Monteverdi. The words were written in Italian by Giacomo Badoaro. It was first performed in Venice during the 1639â€“1640 carnival season. It was not performed very much until the 20th century. The opera is based on the story of Odysseus' return to Ithaca and his contest with the unwanted suitors of his loyal wife Penelope.
