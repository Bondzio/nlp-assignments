The Andy Griffith Show

The Andy Griffith Show is an American sitcom television series. The series won no awards, but it was very popular in its day. It was #1 in its final year on the air.


The series is about a sheriff in fictional Mayberry, North Carolina, a friendly, backward town with colorful characters. Andy is a widower with a young son named Opie. His paternal Aunt Bee, lives with them and maintains the home. Andy's friend/cousin (or cousin-in-law), Barney is his oddball deputy/ sidekick.

The show aired on CBS between October 3, 1960 and April 1, 1968. Griffith, Howard, and Bavier were introduced in an episode of "The Danny Thomas Show". The show transitioned to color with the sixth season. The broad, cornball comedy was toned-down and the show was allowed to touch on serious themes.

Don Knotts and Frances Bavier won a combined total of six Emmy Awards. Knotts left the show at the end of its fifth black and white season.
The series had two spin-offs: "Mayberry, RFD", a sitcom series starring Ken Berry as councilman/ farmer Sam Jones and featured most of the characters from the Andy Griffith Show, and "Gomer Pyle, USMC" with filling station worker Gomer (Jim Nabors) becoming a marine. A 1986 NBC TV movie, Return To Mayberry, brought most of the cast members together once again.
