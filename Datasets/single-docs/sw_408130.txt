Tabouleh

Tabouleh ( "tabÅ«lah"; also tabbouleh or tab(b)ouli) is a salad. It is usually made of bulgur, tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley, mint, onion, and garlic, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. There are other ways to make it, such as using couscous instead of bulgur.

The salad originally came from the mountains of Syria and Lebanon. It has become popular throughout the Middle East, and has spread to other countries. It is a popular ethnic food in Western countries.

In the Arab world, particularly Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine, it is usually served as part of a meze.
