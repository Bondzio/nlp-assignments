Marginocephalia

Marginocephalians (meaning "fringed heads") are a group of Ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs that have a distinctive skull structure (a slight shelf or bony frill on the back of the skull), a unique palate (part of the mouth) and a short pubis (part of the hip). 

These herbivores include the ceratopsians (horned dinosaurs like "Triceratops", "Styracosaurus", "Pentaceratops", and "Protoceratops") and the pachycephalosaurians (thick-skulled dinosaurs like "Stegoceras" and "Pachycephalosaurus").
