Prototheria

The Prototheria is a subclass of mammals. The name comes from Greek "prōtos" means 'first', and "thēr", 'beast'. The only surviving animals in this subclass are the Monotremes.

There are two other subclasses, the Metatheria and the Eutheria. Metatheria contains the marsupials. All the other mammals are Eutherian.

Evidence is accumulating that the Prototheria is not a natural group, but alternative suggestions are not yet agreed.
