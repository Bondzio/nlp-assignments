Periodic table block

A block in the periodic table is an area of chemical elements that has the same electron arrangement. There are four blocks; the S-block, the P-block, the D-block, and the F-block. The alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals are in the S-block. The group of elements after the transition metals are the P-block. The transition metals are the D-block, as well as the last lanthanide and actinide. The rest of the inner transition metals are in the F-block.
