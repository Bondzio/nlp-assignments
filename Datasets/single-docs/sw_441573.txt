Nostratic

Nostratic is a hypothetical language family which includes many of the present-day language families of Eurasia. The idea is that Nostratic was spoken after the ice sheets melted, but before people spread out throughout Europe and Asia.

Many of today's languages are descendants of Nostratic, so it is thought. These include the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian languages. Usually also included are the Afroasiatic languages native to North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East, and the Dravidian languages of the Indian subcontinent. 

The name "Nostratic" is derived from the Latin "nostrates" "fellow countrymen". The idea was expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, called the "Moscovite school" by Bomhard. It has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.

The hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. Some linguists take an agnostic view.
