Time in Jordan

Time in Jordan is primarily Arabia Standard Time (AST). But however, even though AST is 3 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (), in the winter, it is 2 hours ahead of UTC (). When DST is in effect, it is the same time as bordering Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Jordan observes Daylight saving time from March to October.
