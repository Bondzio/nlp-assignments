Atomic mass unit

An atomic mass unit is a unit of measurement that is used to measure the mass of atoms. The atomic mass unit (abbreviated: amu or u) is roughly equal to the mass of 1 proton or 1 neutron.

The unified atomic mass unit and the dalton are different names for the same thing. The dalton name is used more over time. The unit is named after John Dalton, an 18th-century naturalist and teacher.
