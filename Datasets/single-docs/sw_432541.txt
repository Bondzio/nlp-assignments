Jura, Scotland

Jura is an island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, just north-east of Islay. Compared with its fertile and more populous neighbour, Jura is mountainous, bare and infertile. It is covered largely by vast areas of blanket bog, hence its small population. In a list of the islands of Scotland ranked by size, Jura comes eighth, whereas ranked by population it comes thirty-first. It is in the council area of Argyll and Bute.
