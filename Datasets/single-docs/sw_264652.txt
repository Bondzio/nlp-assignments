Inland taipan

The Inland Taipan ("Oxyuranus microlepidotus"), also called the fierce snake or western taipan, is a snake in Australia. It is the most venomous snake on Earth. It belongs to the Elapidae family. Although it is poisonous, the snake is rather shy, and prefers to escape from trouble.

A bite from the inland taipan can be very fatal. One bite from the snake contains enough venom to kill about 100 people at once, and it can kill someone in just 30 to 45 minutes.
