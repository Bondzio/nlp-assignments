Caulifla

Caulifla is a character of the Japanese anime series Dragon Ball Super. She is a Saiyan of Universe 6 in the Universal Survival Arc.
Caulifla is a fairly tall woman of slender build. She wears a low cut magenta top, low-set purple bellbottoms, and black bracelets on each wrist. Her hair is long, wild, and spiky. Caulifla is a lazy and arrogant Saiyan woman.
Caulifla is first seen sitting on a large throne-like chair eating a large bone of meat. After being informed by Renso, Cabba attempts to recruit her to the Universe 6 team, but Caulifla shows no interest, regardless of what may happen to Universe 6. After Cabba transforms, Caulifla accepts his invitation to the team, knowing she has the ability to not only transform into Super Saiyan, but also get stronger. Later Caulifla is seen in a rocky area with Cabba and her protégée Kale, Cabba teaches Caulifla how to become a Super Saiyan. Cabba then explains to her to focus her energy on her back. Caulifla tries this and she easily transform into to a Super Saiyan. Caulifla also transform into to a Super Saiyan 2 like when she easily deflect a energy blast from Kale in her Legendary Super Saiyan like form. In the Tournament of Power Caulifla and her Protégée Kale both fought Goku in a fight. Caulifla was in her Super Saiyan 2 form while Kale was in her Legendary Super Saiyan like form. Caulifla is also expected to be in future episodes of Dragon Ball Super.
