Cornea

The cornea is the front part of the eye. It is the clear transparent section of the eye which that covers the iris, pupil, and the eye chamber. It is a very special form of tissue because the cornea is clear, has no blood vessels, and has nerves with no myelin sheaths on them.

The cornea, with the lens, refracts light. The cornea and the lens bend light so the image strikes the retina. The cornea does about two-thirds of this refraction.

Dua's layer is a newly discovered layer of the cornea. It was described in June 2013. It is the sixth layer of the cornea to be discovered. Despite its thinness, the layer is very strong, and air cannot get through it.
