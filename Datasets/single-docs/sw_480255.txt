The album features the Billboard Hot 100 number single "Fancy" which features English singer Charli XCX as well as guest appearances from R&B singer Rita Ora and rapper T.I.. Azalea also stated that the reason why she named it "The New Classic" by saying "I think people think of classic and they think of a Nas record or a Jay-Z record or "The Chronic", what makes something classic is when you hear it and you have that moment that is a time capsule. When I say 'The New Classic,' I just want to make records that give you that moment for fans that they can remember where they were when they heard it."
"The New Classic" received mixed reviews from music critics..
