The Used

The Used are an American post hardcore band. They formed in the year 2000 and have released a number of albums since then. Their first album was called "The Used". Their latest album is called "Vulnerable", and was released in 2012. 

They have always been signed to one record label named Reprise. In 2004, singer Bert McCracken's girlfriend at the time was pregnant with their child and she died from a drug overdose. For that reason, their second album was named "In Love and Death". Around that time, the band also took on a new drummer.
