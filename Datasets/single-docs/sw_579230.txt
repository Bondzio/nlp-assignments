Lonnie Brooks

Lonnie Brooks (born Lee Baker Jr., December 18, 1933 â€“ April 1, 2017) was an American blues singer and guitarist. 

The "Rolling Stone" said that "His music is witty, soulful and ferociously energetic, brimming with novel harmonic turnarounds, committed vocals and simply astonishing guitar work." "New York Times", wrote, "He sings in a rowdy baritone, sliding and rasping in songs that celebrate lust, fulfilled and unfulfilled; his guitar solos are pointed and unhurried, with a tone that slices cleanly across the beat. Wearing a cowboy hat, he looks like the embodiment of a good-time bluesman."

Brooks died in Chicago, Illinois on April 1, 2017 from a short-illness, aged 83.
