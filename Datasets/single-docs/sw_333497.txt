List of counties in Connecticut

This is a list of counties in Connecticut. There are eight counties in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Four of them were formed in 1666, when the colony of Connecticut was made from a number of smaller colonies. Two counties were made during colonial times, and two counties, Middlesex and Tolland, were formed after American independence (both in 1785). Six of the counties are named for locations in England, where many early Connecticut settlers were from. Although Connecticut is in counties, there is no county government. Local government is done by cities and towns.
