Zettabyte

A zettabyte (ZB) is a unit of measurement for computers of the future. One zettabyte holds 1000 exabytes (EB) or a billion trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes, and 1000 zettabytes make one yottabyte. 

A zettabyte is so large that it would take about a million supercomputers (or a billion powerful home computers) 
to store this amount of data.
