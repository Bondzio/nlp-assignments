Vought F4U Corsair

The Vought F4U Corsair was a fighter aircraft that fought in World War II and the Korean War. Vought could not keep up with demand for the aircraft, so Goodyear and Brewster made them. It has longest production run of any piston-engined fighter in U.S. history (1942–1953).

The Corsair was used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Fleet Air Arm and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, as well as the French Navy "Aéronavale" and other, smaller, air forces. It became the most capable carrier-based fighter-bomber of World War II. Some Japanese pilots said it was the best American fighter of World War II, and the U.S. Navy reported an 11:1 kill ratio. As well as being a great fighter, the Corsair proved to be an excellent fighter-bomber.
