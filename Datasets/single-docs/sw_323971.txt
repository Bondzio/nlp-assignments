Kadena Air Base

The military base is in the towns of Kadena and Chatan and the city of Okinawa in Okinawa Prefecture.

During the invasion of Okinawa in 1945, the airport was bombed by the US. The damage was repaired and it became a US air base. 

The American air base on this Japanese island is controversial.
