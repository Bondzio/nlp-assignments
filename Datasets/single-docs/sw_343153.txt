Léon Bakst

Léon Samoilovitch Bakst (10 May 1866 – 28 December 1924) was a Russian painter. He designed the sets and costumes for some of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes productions. These were "Cleopatra" (1909), "Scheherazade" (1910), "Carnaval" (1910), "Narcisse" (1911), "Le Spectre de la Rose" (1911), and "Daphnis et Chloé" (1912). Bakst died in 1924 in Paris. In late 2010, the Victoria and Albert Museum presented an exhibition of Bakst's costumes and prints.
