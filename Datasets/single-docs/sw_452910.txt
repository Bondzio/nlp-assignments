Software release life cycle

A software release life cycle is the different stages of making a computer program, giving it out to other people, and making sure the computer program works right after it is released.

Pre-alpha is the first stage of making a computer program. People making the computer program think up what the computer program should have in it, and start to actually create the computer program itself.

Alpha software is a computer program that can do most of what the programmers (people who make the software) want it to do, but it has lots of problems. Only the things that the programmers "really "want the software to do has been made without many problems.

A computer program goes into beta when programmers have made the software do everything it needs to do, but there may still be problems. The people who make the software then give it out to other people, so they can test whether the software works. Often, they find problems that they did not find in alpha.
