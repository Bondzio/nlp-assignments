Prix Constantin

The Prix Constantin is a yearly French music prize. It is awarded to the best album of an artist who has come to fame during the past year. It was formed in 2002. Its basic purpose is to help newer artists who are not very popular to gain publicity. All albums made in France in the past year are able to win.

The Prix Constantin is named after the record industry figure Philippe Constantin, who died in 1996. The Mercury Music Prize was used as an example on making the award.
