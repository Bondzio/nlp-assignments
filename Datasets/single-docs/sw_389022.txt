Pyramid (geometry)

A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape. It has triangular sides that come together in a point at the top, call the "apex". A pyramid with a square base (bottom) and four sides is called a square pyramid. A pyramid with a triangular base and three sides is called a tetrahedron.
The formula for the volume of a pyramid is:
This means that one must find the volume by multiplying the base (B) by the height (h), then dividing the product by three.
The base is also known as the product of the length and the width, thus this formula could alternatively be written:
Either way works, but the technical formula for the volume of a pyramid is the former, due to its use of the capital B, which is shorthand for length and width as previously mentioned.
