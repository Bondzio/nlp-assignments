Free diving

Free diving is diving underwater (usually in the ocean) without using a breathing apparatus (air carried in tanks on their backs). Free divers practice holding their breath for long periods of time so that they can stay underwater a long time.

Usually free divers stay underwater for about 45 seconds. That allows them to explore 30 feet underwater, which is where most marine life lives.

Free diving equipment includes a mask, snorkel, fins, wetsuit and weightbelt.

Dangers of free diving include:
