Russia at the Olympics

Russia has been at the modern Olympic Games many times. They have been called different nations. As the Russian Empire, they were first at the 1900 Games. They returned again in 1908 and 1912. After the Russian revolution in 1917, and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, they were not at the Olympics again until the 1952 Summer Olympics. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992. They returned once again as "Russia" at the 1994 Winter Olympics.

The Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Russia will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Since 2012, Russian athletes have won a total of 404 medals (399 since 1994) at the Summer Olympic Games. They have another 91 at the Winter Olympic Games. Over the most recent ten Games (since 1994), Russia's 495 total medals, including 170 gold medals, are second only to the United States (with 631 and 237, respectively).

The Russian Olympic Committee was formed in 1991 and recognized in 1993.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Total medal counts include a gold medal awarded in the figure skating events at the 1908 Summer Olympics. This medal is included in the summer games medal totals and the winter sport medal totals. This is why the totals for summer and winter games do not match the totals for summer and winter sports.
