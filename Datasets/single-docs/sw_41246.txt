Mall

A mall (or shopping centre) is a large building that has many stores (usually over 100) that are close to each other and sell products. 

People visit the stores in the mall to shop. Most malls have parking lots (places to park cars). Most malls also have roofs so people can shop inside. Most malls have a food court. Food courts are areas where people buy food. Some malls have movie theatres.
