Western Europe

Western Europe is a geographic region of Europe. This term does not have a precise definition. Its use has changed over time. During the Cold War, "Western Europe" was a geographic and socio-political concept. It meant the European countries of the First World of the Western world, which are also vaguely defined. It was distinguished from Eastern Europe by differences of economics, politics, and religion. It includes some or all of the following 24 countries:
Many of these countries were members of the Western European Union. Many, such as Norway, are also in Northern Europe or in Central Europe or Southern Europe. 

Today, the term "Western Europe" has to do with geography and with economics. The concept is commonly associated with liberal democracy, capitalism and also with the European Union, though that also has some countries of Eastern Europe. 

Most of the countries in the region share Western culture, and many have economic, and political ties with countries in North and South America and Oceania.

In addition, Scandinavia (in Northern Europe) is commonly associated with social democracy and remains fairly neutral throughout international disputes. The Iberian Peninsula, the most western part of Europe is similarly closely linked to the Americas.
