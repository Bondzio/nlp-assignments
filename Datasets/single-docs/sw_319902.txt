Israel at the Olympics

Israel has been at the Olympic Games as a nation since 1952. Its National Olympic Committee was formed in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine. As the team represented the Jewish community, it boycotted the 1936 Games in Germany in protest of the Nazi Party's anti-Semitic policies. Israel has sent a team to each Summer Olympic Games since 1952 (except the 1980 Summer Olympics) and to each Winter Olympic Games since 1994. In 1972, 11 members of the Israeli delegation were murdered by Black September terrorists.
