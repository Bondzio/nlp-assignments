PBS Kids

PBS Kids is the educational children's programming brand of Public Broadcasting System. It started in 1999. Its programming is non-commercial, like all PBS programming. PBS Kids programs are mostly shown in the daytime. These programs are meant for children ages 3â€“10. PBS Kids's programs use science, math and reading. Some of them also include social studies. All of the programs give a problem that the children have to solve. An example of these problems would be what to do when two children want to play with the same thing but fight (teaching the importance of sharing).

The following PBS Kids programs are in production and airing on PBS stations or online. Programs from both the PBS Kids Preschool Block and PBS Kids Go! are listed because they are all part of the PBS Kids brand and included on the official PBS Kids site.


The following programs are no longer being made. Some of them may still be broadcast as reruns on some PBS stations or other channels.
