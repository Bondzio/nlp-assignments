Missouri House of Representatives

The Missouri House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the Missouri General Assembly. It has 163 members, representing districts with an average size of 37,000 residents. Members of the House are elected for a two-year term during general elections held in even-numbered years.

In 1992 Missouri approved a constitutional amendment providing term limits (before this there were no limits). No Representative may serve more than eight years in the House. Each candidate for the office must be at least twenty-four years old, a qualified registered voter in the state for at least two years, and a resident of his or her district for at least one year.

Missouri's house is the fourth largest in the United States although the state ranks 18th in population. Legislation was introduced in 2011 to cut its size to 103 members in 2020. States with larger legislatures in the United States are New Hampshire (400), Pennsylvania (203) and Georgia (180).

In 1992 Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment placing term limits on the Missouri House of Representatives. A Representative can serve no more than four two-year terms in the house (a total of eight years). The first time term limits prevented someone from running again was in 2002.

As of March 2008, members of the Missouri House of Representatives receive an annual salary of $35,915.44.
