King Island, Alaska

King Island is an island in the Bering Sea, west of Alaska.

In 2005 and 2006 the National Science Foundation (NSF) paid for a research project. They brought a few King Island people back to the Island. Some of the people had not been back in 50 years.

James Cook was the first European to see the island in 1778. He named the island after a person in his group called James King. It is part of the Bering Sea piece of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.
