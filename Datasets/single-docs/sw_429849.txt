Pope John VII (650 â€“ 18 October 707) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1 March 705 until 18 October 707 when he died. 

His father was Plato was a curator of the Palatine Hill. This makes him the first pope to be the son of a Byzantine official.

He had bad relations with the Quinisext council of 692 but had good relations with the Lombards, who had ruled much of Italy at the time. Liber Pontificalis criticized Pope John VII for not signing Canons which were really unpopular in Italy at the time.

Liber Pontificalis said: 

He died on 18 October 707 and was buried in Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was succeeded by Pope Sisinnius.
