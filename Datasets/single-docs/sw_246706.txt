Al Jackson, Jr.

Alan "Al" Jackson, Jr. (November 27, 1935 - December 1, 1975) was an American jazz musician and drummer. He formed the funk and jazz group, Booker T & the MG's.

Jackson was born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1935. He played drums in recording sessions for many other musicians, including Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. Booker T. & the MG's had several successful records including "Green Onions", "Hip Hug-Her", "Hang 'Em High" and "Time Is Tight".

Jackson was murdered at his home in 1975.

A few months before his death, he was attacked and wounded by his girlfriend and manager, Denise LaSalle.

Jackson was shot dead in his home at 3Â am. His wife, who before this had shot him in the chest, said that a burglar came into their house, tied her up, and shot him when he came home. Police said that nothing had been taken from the house, and Jackson's wallet was still on his body. Official investigations ruled out robbery.

Police believe the person who shot Jackson was killed after a gun battle with police on July 15, 1976.

Indictments against Barbara Jackson, Denise LaSalle and her boyfriend were ready to be served but this never happened because of unknown reasons. To this day, Denise LaSalle remains the main suspect in the murder.
