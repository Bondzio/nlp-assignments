Municipalities of Belgium

Belgium is made of 589 municipalities (Dutch: "gemeenten", French: "communes", German: "Gemeinde"). These municipalities are grouped into ten provinces (five belonging to the Flemish Region with 308 municipalities, five to the Walloon Region with 262 municipalities), and the Brussels-Capital Region (with 19 municipalities).

Usually, municipalities are the smallest subdivisions of Belgium, but in municipalities with more than 100,000 people living there, they get divided into districts ().
