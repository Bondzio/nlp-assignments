Motörhead

Motörhead were an English rock band. The band were started in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister. He is known better as ""Lemmy."" Although they started in 1975 they did not start to become famous until they became part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in 1979.

Motörhead played heavy metal music. But they played very fast in their first years. Many listeners call them the first speed metal or thrash metal band. Motörhead are a main influence on other bands that play those styles. Lemmy did not like his band being called anything other than just a rock and roll band.

Motörhead's music has sounded the same through the years. The words to their songs are about things like: war, sex, and partying.

Motörhead are famous to fans of professional wrestling for playing the theme music used by wrestler Triple H when he walks down to the wrestling ring. He started using Motörhead's music in 2000. The song is called ""The Game."" The band have performed the song live at two WrestleMania events.

Motörhead was listed at number 26 on VH1's ""The 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" TV show.

The band broke up in 2015 when Lemmy died of cancer on December 28th of that year, only four days after his 70th birthday.
