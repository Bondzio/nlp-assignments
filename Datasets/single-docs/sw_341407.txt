Gary Thomasson

Gary Leah Thomasson was born July 29, 1951 in San Diego, California. He was a professional baseball player. He played outfield in Major League Baseball from 1972 to 1980 and in Japanese Nippon Pro Baseball 1981-1982

Thomasson got a lot of attention when he joined the Yomiuri Giants. He got the largest contract ever in the Nippon league. Then, Thomasson played poorly in his two years in Japan. He almost set the league record for strikeouts. He ended his career with a knee injury.

Japanese artist Genpei Akasegawa used Thomasson's name to describe a kid of found art. A ""Tomason"" is a part of a building that has lost its meaning or purpose, but still is still interesting.
