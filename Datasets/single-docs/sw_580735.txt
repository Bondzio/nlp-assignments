Kawasaki Heavy Industries &amp; CSR Qingdao Sifang C151B

Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Qingdao Sifang C151B is the fifth generation of rolling stock used on the Singapore MRT system. The trains operate on the East West Line and North South Line.

The first train began its operations on 16 April 2017. As only the new track signalling system, that will be used on the North South Line and East West Line, is installed in these trains, they will only be able to run on Sundays, on the North South Line, for the two following months. This is because the new signalling system is not in full operation yet and is being tested only on Sundays on the North South Line only.

These trains were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CSR Sifang. 45 six-carriage trains, totalling 270 carriages, were built in China.
