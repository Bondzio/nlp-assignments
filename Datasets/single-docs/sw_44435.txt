Richard II of England

Richard II (6 January 1367â€“14 February 1400) was the son of Edward, the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, and Joan of Kent, "The Fair Maid of Kent". He was born in Bordeaux, and became his father's successor when his elder brother died in infancy. His father died before him, so he became king in 1377. His uncle John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster became regent until Richard II could rule. He was deposed by Henry of Bolingbroke (Henry IV), John of Gaunt's son with Blanche of Lancaster, taken prisoner and later died in captivity.

Richard abdicated (resigned) in 1399. He was murdered later that year.
