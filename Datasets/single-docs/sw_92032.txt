In 1975, he was convicted of forging prescriptions for pethidine, to which he was addicted. 

In 1999 he was put on trial and found guilty of 15 murders. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for each murder. An investigation identified another 235 suspicious deaths. His usual way of killing was using morphine. Most of the patients he killed were old women.

While he was an inmate in Wakefield prison, West Yorkshire, he committed suicide on the day before his 58th birthday. It is not known why. At the time of his death he was still married to Primrose Shipman.
