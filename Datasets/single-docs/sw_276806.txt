Special Cases

"Special Cases" is a song on English trip-hop band Massive Attack's fourth full-length album, "100th Window". It was released as the first single from this album on 24 February 2003, reaching #15 in the UK Singles Chart. Having Sin√©ad O'Connor on vocals, it was for many fans of the band their first exposure to the new album.

In addition to a radio edit of the original song, the single release contains a remix by Canadian electronica artist Akufen, as well as "I Against I", a song performed with Mos Def that appeared on the soundtrack of the 2002 film "Blade II". 12" vinyl releases contained more remixes of "Special Cases" by Vladislav Delay, who is credited as "Luomo" for this release.

The song was also made into two separate videos. The Enhanced CD contains one of these, and the other video is on a rare DVD release of the single.
