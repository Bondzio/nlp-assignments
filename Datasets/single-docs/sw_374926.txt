Smart 911

Smart 911 is a smartphone application linked with the emergency telephone number from the United States (911). This application allows people to enter the information they want that 911’s operators have in case of emergency. When a person that has a profile calls 911, the operator has access to the information previously recorded as well as police, firefighters and doctors. 

Before this application, when someone called 911 from a cell phone or a landline, the operator just had the information that the victim told them. As technology advanced, workers could find the location from the caller. But sometimes, the data weren’t accurate and it took longer to get to help.

This fact and the evolution of mobile phones with internet have prompted Smart 911. It allows personal assistants, police, firefighters and doctors to have a database from the victim, that the person had created before.

It is a free and voluntary enrollment. The only thing to do is to enter on the official website (Smart 911), and introduce a number phone that you want to register, as well as other useful information like medical information that may be help in a critical situation.

Also they can add information about their pets and their kids, with photos of them and even pictures of the house, a small basic information about the distribution of their house, because it can help service workers to access on the house if it’s necessary. The photographs of children and pets can help if they disappear.

The application is very useful for people who have chronic diseases or a disability.

Registered information on the profile has to be protected by Smart 911 service. Only police, firefighters or doctors can access this profile.
