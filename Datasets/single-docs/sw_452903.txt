Arrondissement of Montauban

The arrondissement of Montauban is an arrondissement of France. It is part of the Tarn-et-Garonne "département". Its capital, and préfecture of the department, is the city of Montauban.

When the Tarn-et-Garonne department was created in 1808, Montauban was one of the original "arrondissements" of the department.

It is the easternmost of the "arrondissements" of the department, with an area of , the largest in area of the two "arrondissements" of the department. It has 175,756 inhabitants and a population density of inhabitants/km².

The "arrondissement" is bordered to the north by the Lot (Occitanie) department, to the northeast by the Aveyron (Occitanie) department, to the east by the Tarn (Occitanie) department, to the south by the Haute-Garonne (Occitanie) department and to the west by the "arrondissement" of Castelsarrasin.

After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the "arrondissements" so they could have "communes" that belong to different "arrondissements". That is the case of the Beaumont-de-Lomagne, Castelsarrasin, Montech and the Pays de Serres Sud-Quercy cantons where some "communes" are in the "arrondissement" of Montauban and others in the "arrondissement" of Castelsarrasin. The following table shows the distribution of the "communes" in the cantons and "arrondissements":
