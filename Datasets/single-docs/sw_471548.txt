Dayananda Saraswati

Dayananda Saraswati (, "Maharshi Dayānand Sarasvatī") born (12 February 1824 – 30 October 1883), at Tankara was an important Hindu religious leader of his time. He was the founder of the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement of the Vedic tradition. He was a scholar of Vedic lore and Sanskrit language. He was the first to give the call for "Swarajya" as "India for Indians" in 1876.

Maharshi Dayananda taught the doctrine of Karma (Karmasiddhanta in Hinduism) and Reincarnation (Punarjanma in Hinduism). He emphasized the Vedic ideals of "brahmacharya" (celibacy) and "Bhakti" (devotion to God). He promoted equal rights for women. This included the right to education and reading of Indian scriptures. He was against child marriage. He was also against idol worshipping and animal sacrifice. He spoke out against other religions, especially Islam and Christianity. He felt they were out to destroy the Hindu faith.
