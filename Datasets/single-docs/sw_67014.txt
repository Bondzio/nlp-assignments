Vascular plant

The vascular plants, tracheophytes or higher plants are plants that have specialized tissues for conducting water, minerals, and photosynthetic products through the plant.

They include the ferns, clubmosses, horsetails, flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms.

The vascular plants are set apart in two main ways:

Water transport happens in either xylem or phloem: xylem carries water and inorganic solutes upward toward the leaves from the roots, while phloem carries organic solutes throughout the plant.
