Jamaican English

Jamaican English is a type of English where some words are changed to suit Jamaican accents. It uses parts of both American and British English.

A simple example of this would be "Ku pon dis mudda, dis mon hab a crazy 'ead, truss mi."
Which would mean "Look at this mom, this man is crazy, trust me."
