College Board

The College Board is a group that manages standardized tests in the United States, like the SAT, to test students' abilities in certain subject areas. It was founded in 1900, known then as the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB).

The SAT is a test for entrance to colleges and universities. It is a standardized test managed by the College Board, and developed, published, and scored by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). It is fee-based, costing about $50. It competes with the ACT, another standardized test for college admissions.

The College Board Accuplacer test is a placement test on the computer that tests students on their reading, writing, and math skills.

The College Board Advanced Placement Program is a program that gives high school students a chance to take college level classes for a fee, preparing them for college. It also helps admissions to college. The program lets students get college credit for high scores on AP exams. Giving credit is still up to the college.

The CLEP, or the College Level Examination Program, is a program that lets students show that they know college-level material through exams in college courses.

SpringBoard is a program created by the College Board to prepare students who will take AP or college courses later. The program offers pre-AP and AP teaching and learning strategies across school and classwork. The material is for grades 6th to 12th.
