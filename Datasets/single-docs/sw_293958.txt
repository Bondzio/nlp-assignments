Ralph Darling

General Sir Ralph Darling (1772—1858) was an officer in the British Army and the Governor of New South Wales from 1825—1831. Darling was the first governor to work with an Executive Council, made up of the lieutenant-governor, chief justice, colonial secretary and the archdeacon. These four people and another three people that Darling could select would make up the Legislative Council. Darling was expected to follow their advice in governing New South Wales.
