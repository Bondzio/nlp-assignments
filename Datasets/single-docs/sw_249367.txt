Acacia

Acacia is a genus of shrub or tree are belonging to the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae, first described in Africa by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian Acacias are not. 

Acacias are heavily defended against herbivores. Different species have different combinations of defences:

Products from the Acacia have often been used for medicinal purposes.

Various species of acacia yield gum. True gum arabic is the product of "Acacia senegal", abundant in dry tropical West Africa from Senegal to northern Nigeria.

"Acacia arabica" is the gum-Arabic tree of India, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.
