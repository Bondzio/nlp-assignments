Beitar Jerusalem F.C.

Beitar Jerusalem Football club (Hebrew: מועדון כדורגל בית"ר ירושלים, Moadon Kaduregel Beitar Yerushalayim) is an Israeli football club from Jerusalem. The club is linked with the right wing politics since it was created.
The club was founded in 1936 by David Horn. He was the head of the local Betar movement. The Betar movement was a Zionist youth organisation. Most of the early players came from this group. In 1938 the club stopped playing because most of the players were arrested by the British authorities in Palestine. In 1943, they were able to play again.During his existence the club was very successful. The team was never relegated from the Israeli Premier League. It was one of the original 14 Israeli Premier League teams at the time of its foundation in 1999. In the all-time table of the league Beitar ranks 4th.

The club first home was the "Banana Field" close to Beitar youth group's "nest".In the 1950s the club moved to the YMCA Stadium.Later it was shared with Hapoel Jerusalem. The YMCA was nicknamed the sandbox because the field was in a very poor condition.

In 1991 both clubs moved to the Teddy Stadium, named after longtime Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek. Initially the stadium was two-sided and held 12,000 spectators. This was increased to 21,600 when a third side was completed in 1997.
