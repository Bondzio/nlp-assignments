Owari Province

The ancient capital of Owari was near Inazawa

The province was created in 646. 

In the Sengoku Period, Oda Nobunaga held Kiyosu Castle. 

In the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road was the main route between the Imperial capital at Kyoto and the main city of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The road passed through Owari.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Owari Province were reformed in the 1870s.

Owari and Mino provinces were separated by the Sakai River.

"Masumida jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Owari.
