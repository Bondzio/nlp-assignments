Eupen-Malmedy

Eupen-Malmedy, or the East Cantons is a group of cantons in Belgium. They are the former Prussian districts of Malmedy and Eupen, together with the Neutral Moresnet. French-speaking Belgians also once called them the "Redeemed Cantons". These territories were added to Belgium in 1920 by the Versailles Treaty.
