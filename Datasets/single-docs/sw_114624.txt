Halifax Explosion

The Halifax explosion took place on December 6, 1917 when the SS "Mont-Blanc", a French cargo ship loaded with explosives collided with the SS "Imo", a Norwegian ship in the harbour in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. 2,000 people were killed and over 9,000 people were injured. This was the largest man-made explosion in history until July, 1945 when the first atomic bomb blew up.
