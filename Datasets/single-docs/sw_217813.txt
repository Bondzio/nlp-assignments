Cuboid

A cuboid is a 3D shape. Cuboids have six faces, which form a convex polyhedron. Simply speaking, cuboids are made from 6 rectangles, which are placed at right angles. A cuboid that uses all square faces is a cube; if the faces are rectangles, other than squares, it looks like a shoe box.
Properties of a Cuboid are:
The basic difference between a rectangle and a cuboid is that one is a 2D shape and the other is a 3D shape.

The basic difference between a cube and cuboid is that a cube has equal length, height and breadth whereas in cuboids these three may not be the same.
