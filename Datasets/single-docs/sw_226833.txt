Edinburgh Festival Fringe

The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (The Fringe) is the worldâ€™s largest arts festival. It started in 1947. It takes place every year at the same time as the Edinburgh International Festival: late August and early September. There are hundreds of different events, ranging from concerts, theatre, opera, dance to many informal events such as street performers.

The organisers are the Festival Fringe Society: they publish a programme every year, sell tickets and give advice to performers from the Fringe office on the Royal Mile.
