Collide with the Sky

Collide with the Sky is the third album by San Diego experimental rock group Pierce the Veil. It was released on July 27, 2012 under Fearless Records in the United States. The album's lead single "King for A Day" was released on June 5, 2012 for digital download and contemporary radio. The single features Sleeping With Sirens singer Kellin Quinn. The second single titled "Bulls in the Bronx" was released on June 25, 2012 for digital download. The band supported the album throughout the 2012 Van's Warped Tour in the summer. 


According to Vic Fuentes, "the theme to the album artwork is 'jumping off of the ground that is breaking beneath you'. The idea is to inspire hope amongst the chaos that may be happening around you. If the ground was breaking beneath your feet, your first reaction may be to run and jump to safety, and it's that moment where you are suspended in the air that I am focusing on. A still frame where you're not sure if the person is falling or flying. It's about freeing yourself from the things that are breaking or falling apart in your life, and inspiring a sense of hope from the desperation".

The album has been received rather well by critics. Alternative Press rated the album 4/5 stars saying "Collide with the Sky is PTV's best work to date". They praised the album for the power pop hooks on "Props & Mayhem", saying that you should download "Tangled in the Great Escape". AbsolutePunk commented that the album is "sure to continue Pierce the Veil's steady ascent to the top of their league", concluding that "[it] proves Pierce the Veil are seemingly still one step ahead of everyone else when it comes to concocting energetic slices of post-hardcore and that they wonâ€™t be dropping the ball any time soon."


The album was released in the United Kingdom on July 16, 2012. It was released in the United States on July 17, 2012 with the release of the bonus track "Hold On Till May", the acoustic version.
