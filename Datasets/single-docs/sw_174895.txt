Battle of Granada

The Battle of Granada was a siege of the city of Granada. It was fought several months and lead to the surrender of Granada on January 2, 1492. The forces of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile fought against the armies of the Muslim Emirate of Granada. 

This relatively small campaign was of enormous consequences because Granada was the last outpost of Al-Andalus in Spain and its fall meant the end of 780 years of Muslim control in the Iberian Peninsula. It also was the last act in the Reconquista, the campaign by the medieval Christian states of Spain to drive out the Moorish invaders.

Granada still celebrates the 2nd of January.
