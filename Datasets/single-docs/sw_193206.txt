Banzai charge

A Banzai charge (or ""banzai" attack") (萬歳突撃) was a tactic used by Japanese soldiers against American soldiers when they were losing World War II. Banzai charges were usually suicide charges. This was so they would have an honourable death without surrender. Also, the charges were a final attempt to gain success against the Allied forces, which usually had more troops.
