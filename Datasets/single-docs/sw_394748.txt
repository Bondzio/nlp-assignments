Epic Mickey

Epic Mickey is a platform video game for the Nintendo Wii game console. It was developed by Junction Point Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios. It was released in Europe on November 26, 2010, in North America on November 30, 2010, and in Japan on August 4, 2011.

The game stars Mickey Mouse, who accidentally damages a world of forgotten Disney characters and concepts. He uses a magic paintbrush to fight enemies. The game is intended to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by focusing his adventurous side rather than his pleasant, cheerful side, doing so by showing him as an heroic character. The game is darker and more complex than previous Mickey Mouse games. It features the first appearance of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's first successful cartoon character, as a major character since 1943.

A sequel, "Epic Mickey: The Power of Two", was released for the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in 2012.
