George Pataki

George Elmer Pataki (; born June 24, 1945) is an American politician. He was the 53rd Governor of New York. A member of the Republican Party, Pataki served three consecutive four-year terms from January 1, 1995, until December 31, 2006.

Pataki was born in Peekskill, New York. He is of an Austrian-Hungarian ancestry. After graduating fom Peekskill High School, he entered Yale University with George W. Bush in 1964 on an academic scholarship and graduated in three years. While there he served as chairman of the Conservative Party of the Yale Political Union.

Pataki's first job in politics was mayor of his hometown of Peekskill. In 1994 he ran a campaign against Mario Cuomo for Governor of New York. Cuomo was one of the most famous politicians in the country at the time and he was an icon of liberalism in the country. Few people expected Pataki to win, but in a major upset, Pataki won the election.

He served three terms as Governor of New York State. A popular governor, Pataki became most famous for his leadership of the state after the September 11th attacks in 2001. He also focused on creating jobs in the state and creating increased parkland for New Yorkers.

Pataki had often been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. In early 2015, he began exploring a candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, and announced his candidacy on May 28, 2015. On December 29, 2015, Pataki announced that he would be ending his Presidential campaign. A few days later, he announced his support for Marco Rubio for president. After Rubio dropped out and days before the New York primary, Pataki endorsed Ohio governor John Kasich for the nomination.

Pataki married Elizabeth Rowland in 1973. They have four children: Emily, Teddy, Allison, and Owen.
