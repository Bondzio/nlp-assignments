Mitch Hedberg

Mitchell Lee "Mitch" Hedberg (February 24, 1968 â€“ March 30, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and comedian. He was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. Hedberg's trademark was his hippie look and his relaxed unconventional comedic delivery.

Hedberg began his stand-up career in Florida. He later moved to Seattle and began to tour. He soon appeared on MTV's "Comikaze". This was followed by a 1996 appearance on the "Late Show with David Letterman" that brought him his big break. He won the 1997 grand prize at the Seattle Comedy Competition. The next year he appeared in an episode of Fox's series "That '70s Show".

In 1999, he completed his own independent feature movie, "Los Enchiladas!". He was the star, writer, director and producer. He recorded three comedy CDs: "Strategic Grill Locations", "Mitch All Together", and "Do You Believe in Gosh?". The the last was released posthumously. He also appeared at the Montreal Just for Laughs comedy festival in 1996, and again in 1998 and 2001.

At the same time as his rising fame in the entertainment industry, Hedberg appeared on Letterman nine more times. He signed a half-million dollar deal with Fox for a television sitcom. Hedberg was supposed to be the next Jerry Seinfeld. George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Mike Birbiglia and Lewis Black were reportedly among his comedian fans.
