Derby Museum and Art Gallery

Derby Museum and Art Gallery was started in 1879 in a new building given to Derby by a local brewer. The collection today includes paintings of Joseph Wright of Derby and porcelain from Derby and the surrounding area. 

In 2011, Derby City Council announced that it was to use Joseph Wright of Derby to brand the city of Derby. At the same time, the Museum announced that it was "joining forces" with Wikipedia to improve the quality of its information. In February 2011 it was announced that Derby Museum had been given an award for its collection of paintings and drawings by Joseph Wright.
