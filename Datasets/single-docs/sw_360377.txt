Academy Award for Best Costume Design

The Academy Award for Best Costume Design is one of the Academy Awards of Merit. It is given each year by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for achievement in movie costume design.

It was first given for movies made in 1948. This was when separate awards were given for black-and-white and color movies. Since the merger of the two categories in 1967, the academy has not given out the award to contemporary movies very often.

From 1957 onwards, the award merged into one category.

For 1959 the Award was again divided into two awards.

From 1967 the category was merged permanently.
