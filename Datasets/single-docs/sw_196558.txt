Hebephilia

Hebephilia is when adults are mostly or only sexually attracted to young people from early puberty until their mid-teenage years (generally between 11 and 14 years). 
An adult with this attraction is called a "hebephile". The word "hebephilia" comes from Greek. "Hebe" is the Greek goddess of youth, and "philia" means "love". Nowadays, many media reports cover hebephilic acts between female teachers and young students.
