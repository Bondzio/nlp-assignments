Andy Kaufman

Andrew Geoffrey "Andy" Kaufman (January 17, 1949 – May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, comedian, actor, and singer. Kaufman was known for his role as Latka Gravas in the comedy television series "Taxi" and for creating Tony Clifton, a fictional character.

Kaufman was born on January 17, 1949 in New York City, New York to a Jewish family. He was raised in Great Neck, Long Island, New York. Kaufman studied at Grahm Junior College. He was never married and had no children. 

Kaufman died on May 16, 1984 in West Hollywood, California from a rare case of lung cancer, aged 35. He was buried at Beth David Cemetery, Elmont, New York.

Kaufman allegedly told many people—including Bob Zmuda—that he wished to fake his own death. This had caused some fans to believe Kaufman was still alive when he died. Kaufman himself said that if he were to fake his death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004. Many of Kaufman's fans saw a picture that looks similar to that of Andy. 

There is a website related to this theory, and, recently, "a grainy video has surfaced that purports to show Kaufman living under an assumed name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
