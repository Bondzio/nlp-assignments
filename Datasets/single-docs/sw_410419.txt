Division of Oxley (1901â€“34)

The Division of Oxley was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Queensland. It covered the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane, including South Brisbane, Woolloongabba, Coorparoo, Bulimba and Maree.

Oxley was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It was named after explorer John Oxley. It was replaced by the Division of Griffith at the redistribution of 1 August 1934. In 1949, a new Division of Oxley was created in the south-western suburbs of Brisbane, mainly around Ipswich.
