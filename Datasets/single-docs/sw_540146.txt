Irena Sendler

Irena Sendler (15 February 1910 – 12 May 2008) was a nurse and social worker in Warsaw, Poland. During World War II, when Poland was occupied by Nazis, she took about 2,500 Jewish children out of Poland with help from other members of the Żegota (The Polish Council to Aid Jews). She was caught, and the Nazis tortured her. The Nazis were planning on killing her, but she avoided death.
