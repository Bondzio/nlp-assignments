Betta

Betta is a genus of fish that includes the Siamese fighting fish. The males of this type of fish have long flowing fins, whilst the females do not, and the males also have a larger range of color.

Betas come from Southeast Asia. Many of them can be purchased in a local petstore.

Male betas can not be in the same tank or bowls because they will fight. Betas are known as the fighting fish. Males and females are easy to tell apart because males are more colorful than female betas.
