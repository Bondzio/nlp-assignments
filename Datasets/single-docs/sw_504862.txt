In 1851, the Province of Canada issued the stamps of Queen Victoria. For the stamp image, the Queen's portrait by Alfred Edward Chalon (1780–1860) was used. This design is called the "Chalon head". The stamps were printed in New York.

In fine and unused condition, these stamps are very priced. In February 2006, a Twelve Penny Black was sold £116,000.
