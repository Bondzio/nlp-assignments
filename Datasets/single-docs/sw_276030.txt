Knesset

The Knesset ( - lit. "HaKnesset"; meaning "the gathering" or "assembly"; ) is the legislative branch of the government of Israel. It makes laws, elects the president and prime minister, supervises the work of the government, and has the power to remove the President and the State Comptroller from office and to call new elections. The Knesset has de jure authority to make and change any laws without being overturned. It can pass any law by a simple majority. There are 120 members in the Knesset.

The Knesset is located in Givat Ram, a western central neighbourhood of Jerusalem.

Current Knesset is the 20th Knesset, elected on March 17, 2015 and sworn in on March 31, 2015.
