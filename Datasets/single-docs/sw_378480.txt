Gorgoroth

Gorgoroth are a Norwegian black metal band that are currently based in Bergen. 

The band was formed in 1992 by guitarist Infernus after he made a "deal with the Devil". The name of the band comes from the dead plateau of evil and darkness in the land of Mordor from J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings. 

They released their debut album, "Pentagram", on 12 October 1994.
