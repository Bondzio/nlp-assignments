Freedom of information

Freedom of information is the right to freedom of expression on the Internet and other information technology. Freedom of information is the ability to access the Web without censorship or restrictions. 

Freedom of information is a human right recognised in international law. Freedom of speech includes not only the text and pictures but also the means of expression. Freedom of information may also refer to the right to privacy in the context of the Internet and information technology. The "right to privacy" is a human right and freedom of information is an extension of this right.
