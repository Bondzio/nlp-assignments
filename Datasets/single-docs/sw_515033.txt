Neutral particle

In physics, a neutral particle is a particle with no electric charge.

Long-lived neutral particles do not decay for a very long time. Examples of such particles include photons, neutrons, and neutrinos.

Other neutral particles are very short-lived. They decay before they can be detected by a particle detector. They have been observed only indirectly, such as tracks of ionized particles in a particle accelerator. They include:
