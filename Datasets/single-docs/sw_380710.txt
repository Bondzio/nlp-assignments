Cabin Boy

Cabin Boy is a 1994 fantasy comedy movie directed by Adam Resnick and co-produced by Tim Burton, which starred comedian Chris Elliott. Elliott co-wrote the movie with Resnick. Both men worked for "Late Night with David Letterman" in the 1980s, as well as co-creating the short-lived FOX sitcom "Get a Life" in the early 1990s.

The project was originally to be directed by Tim Burton, who had contacted Chris Elliott after seeing "Get a Life". Resnick took over after Burton was offered the movie "Ed Wood".
