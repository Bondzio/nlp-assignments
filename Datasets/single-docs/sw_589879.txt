Flatbed truck

A flatbed truck (or flatbed lorry in British English) is a truck which can be either articulated or rigid. The back is a flat, level 'bed' with no sides or roof.

Smaller flatbed trucks are rigid. The back has low sides which can be hinges. The sides can be hinged up when goods are on the back and hinged down when unloading goods.
