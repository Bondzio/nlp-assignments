Mario Kart 8

Mario Kart 8 is a racing video game for the Wii U game console. It is part of the "Mario Kart" series. It was released on May 30, 2014.

The game is like other "Mario Kart" games, where characters from the "Mario" series race each other in go-karts. Players are able to use items from item boxes to keep their opponents from winning. Along with go-karts, the game also has motorcycles. There are 12 players in a race. Like in "Mario Kart 7", karts have hang-gliding attachments, and players are able to drive underwater. For the first time in the series, players are able to drive on walls and ceilings. There are two new types of vehicles: UFOs and four-wheel buggies. There is local and online multiplayer for up to 12 players. Players include Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, etc.

The first DLC track pack was revealed in October 2014.
