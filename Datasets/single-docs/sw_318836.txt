List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: A

This is a partial list of famous people who are confirmed to be gay, lesbian or bisexual. Famous people who are rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed. The definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed over time; for example the word "gay" was not used to describe a person's sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. However, there has been a number of different words or slangs that have been used to describe sexual orientations since the mid-19th century. Several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, which made it difficult to find results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as a person's erotic desire) and/or a behavioral component (which is about a person's sexual partner/s). Some people prefer to simply follow their self-definition or identity . 

The high numbers of people from the West on this list may be due to societies attitudes toward homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are dividedâ€“a narrow majority (51 percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42 percent disagree."
