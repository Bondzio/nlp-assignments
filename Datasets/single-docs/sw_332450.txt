Pentane is an alkane. Its chemical formula is . Usually, pentane represents all three isomers ("n"-pentane, isopentane and neopentane). But in the IUPAC, pentane only represents "n"-pentane. In the IUPAC, the other two isomers is 2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane. Cyclopentane's chemical formula is , so it is not an isomer of pentane.

All isomers of pentane burn with oxygen to make carbon dioxide and water:
