Bernard Lown

Bernard Lown (born June 7, 1921) is a Lithuanian-born American cardiologist and anti-nuclear war activist. He is the original developer of the DC defibrillator and the cardioverter, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Throughout his medical career, Lown focused on two major medical challenges: the problem of sudden cardiac death and the role of psychological stress on the cardiovascular system. His investigations led to many medical break-throughs. 

His work made possible and safe much of modern cardiac surgery, as well as a host of other innovations.

In 1985, Lown accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, an organization he co-founded with Soviet cardiologist Dr. Yevgeny Chazov, who later was Minister Of Health of the USSR.
