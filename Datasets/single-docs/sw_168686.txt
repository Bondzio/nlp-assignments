Travertine

Travertine is a terrestrial sedimentary rock. It is a natural chemical precipitate of carbonate minerals; aragonite or calcite. This happens from solution in ground and surface waters, and/or geothermally heated hot-springs. Similar (but extremely porous) deposits formed from ambient-temperature water are known as tufa. 

The Colosseum built by the Romans, was made of travertine.
