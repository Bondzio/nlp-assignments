The Student and Schoolmate

The Student and Schoolmate was a 19th-century monthly American children's magazine. It was the product of a merger between the children's magazines, "The Student" and "The Schoolmate". It began publication in New York City by Calkins & Stiles in 1855, and in Boston the same year by James Robinson.

The magazine went through various name changes: "The Student and Schoolmate" (November 1855-1865); "The Student and Schoolmate, and Forresterâ€™s Boy's and Girl's Magazine" (1865-1866); and "The Student and Schoolmate" (1866-1871); and "The Schoolmate" (1872). 

Boys' book writer William Taylor Adams ("Oliver Optic") edited the magazine between 1858 and 1862. He first published some of his boys' books as serials in its pages. Many of Horatio Alger, Jr.'s boys' books were first published as serials in the magazine, including his all-time bestseller, "Ragged Dick".
