Alice Munro

Alice Ann Munro (born 10 July 1931) is a Canadian writer of short stories. Munro received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013. In her stories Munro has changed the way people write short stories. Her stories usually start in a place where people do not expect. After that, the stories go back and forward in time.

Her first collection of short stories, "Dance of the Happy Shades", was published by Ryerson Press in 1968. It won the 1968 Governor General's Award for Fiction.

Munro's most recent collection of short stories, "Dear Life", was published in 2012 by McClelland and Stewart.
