Richie Benaud

Richard "Richie" Benaud OBE (; 6 October 1930 â€“ 10 April 2015) was an Australian cricketer. After his retirement from international cricket in 1964, he became a well-known commentator on the game.

Benaud was born in Penrith, New South Wales. His parents were of French descent. He was raised in Sydney. Benaud studied at Parramatta High School.

Benaud was a Test cricket all-rounder. Along with fellow bowling all-rounder Alan Davidson, he helped Australia to be at the top of world cricket in the late 1950s and early 1960s after a slump in the early 1950s. In 1958 he became Australia's Test captain until his retirement in 1964.

In November 2014, Benaud announced that he was diagnosed with skin cancer, aged 84. He died in his sleep on 10 April 2015 in Sydney. Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott offered a state funeral for Benaud, but his family rejected the offer.
