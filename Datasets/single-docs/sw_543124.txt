Alexander Van der Bellen (born 18 January 1944) is an Austrian politician and economist. On 23 May 2016, he became the President-elect of Austria. However, after this, the court said the result was wrong. He redid the election, and on 4 December 2016, he won even better. He was sworn into office on 26 January 2017 official becoming the president.

Van der Bellen was born in Vienna. His father was Russian and his mother was Estonian.

In 1962, he graduated from the Akademisches Gymnasium in Innsbruck. He studied economics at the University of Innsbruck. He received a doctorate in 1970.

Van der Bellen is a retired professor of economics at the University of Vienna. He is a member of the Austrian Green Party. He served as a member of the National Council from 1994 to 2012. He was the chairman of the parliamentary club and federal spokesperson of his party from 1997 to 2008.

He ran as a nominally independent candidate supported by the Green Party in the 2016 presidential election, and finished second in the first round before winning the second round against far-right candidate Norbert Hofer. A second election was ordered since the votes were too narrow. In December 2016, Van der Bellen won the election with more votes. He took office on 26 January 2017.

Van der Bellen supports green and social liberal policies, and is supportive of the European Union.
