Chandrayaan 1 was India's first spacecraft launched to explore the Moon. It lifted off on 22 October 2008. It was under the control of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Chandrayaan 1 carried NASA's M1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper. The space mission was designed to last for two years. In actuality the mission lasted for 312 days. It mapped about 95% of the moon's surface. On 29 August 2009 radio signals from Chandrayaan-I were lost. The mission was considered ended at that point. The lunarprobe showed the presence of water on moon.
