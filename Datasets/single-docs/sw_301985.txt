Bangladesh at the Olympics

Bangladesh has been in seven Summer Olympic Games. They have never been in the Winter Olympic Games. 

No Bangladeshi competitor has qualified for the Olympics; the country sends representatives to the Games thanks to the wildcard process. Bangladesh is the most populous country in the world to have never won an Olympic medal. They have had 27 participants in 3 sports.

Bangladesh Olympic Association head Wali Ullah says that Bangledesh's weak economy is the reason for its poor results in sports.
