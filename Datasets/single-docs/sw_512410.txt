Jentina

Jentina Rose Rees (n√©e Chapman) (born 6 March 1984, Woking, England) professionally known as Jentina, is a British hip hop/R&B singer. She is also a rapper, songwriter and model.

Jentina got her first record deal at the age of nineteen. She was working in a computer shop at the time. She then came to fame in 2004 with her debut single "Bad Ass Strippa". It was a rap song that sampled "For the Love of Money" by R&B group The O'Jays. It reached number twenty two in the UK. Her follow up single "French Kisses" which was more R&B than hip hop sounding, reached number twenty. Her third single "Mysterious" didn't chart in the UK and was only released in Italy. Her album "Jentina" was released in Italy in 2005. "Bad Ass Strippa" was later sampled and turned into a diss song by fellow English female rapper Lady Sovereign called "Sad Arse Stripah".

Apart from being a rapper, Jentina was also a model. In November 2007, she modeled for the underwear brand Wonderbra. She was also featured in a jokey video of the Chocolate bar Cadbury's "Gorilla" advert, in which a gorilla played the drums to a Phil Collins song called "In The Air Tonight".

Jentina was born to a Romani family that consisted of fourteen children. When she was one year old, her family moved to West Molesey, Surrey. 

In 2011, Jentina was on the judging panel for "Travellers Got Talent". She also appeared in the 8 part documentary "A Gypsy Life For Me" which aired on Bio in November 2011. 

Jentina is married and has three children. They live in London.
