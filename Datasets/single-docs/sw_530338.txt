London Regional Select Committee

The London Regional Select Committee was one of nine regional select committees of the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The House of Commons agreed to create the committee on 25 June 2009, after committees for the eight other regions of England were created in November 2008. 'Regional ministers' were appointed by Gordon Brown when he was made Prime Minister in June 2007. The committee was created on 1 January 2009. It ceased to exist upon the dissolution of Parliament on 12 April 2010.
