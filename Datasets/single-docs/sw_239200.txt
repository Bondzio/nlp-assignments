4 Maccabees

The book of 4 Maccabees is a religious debate. It is not in the Bible for most churches, but is an added section of the Greek Bible, and in the canon of the Georgian Bible. It was in the 1688 Romanian Bible where it was called "Iosip" but is not printed in the Orthodox Bible today. It is included as an appendix in the recently published Eastern Orthodox Bible.
