Bacillus Calmette-Guérin

Bacillus Calmette–Guerin is a vaccine against tuberculosis. It is often abbreviated "BCG". The vaccine is based on a bovine strain of the bacterium. It was developed by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin in the 1930s. It looks like the vaccine can also be used to treat certain forms of bladder cancer.
