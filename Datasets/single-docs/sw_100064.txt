A girl named Chihiro gets lost in a spirit world. Along with escaping, she has to save her parents, who have turned into pigs as a result of eating food meant for the spirits. She discovers a bathhouse that spirits go to for relaxation. Chihiro is informed by a young apprentice named Haku that she must get a job by asking the boiler man, Kamaji. Kamaji turns her away, but tells her to request a job from Yubaba, the witch who owns the bathhouse, and is Haku's master. Yubaba allows her to stay by having her sign a contract. The contract Chihiro signed allowed Yubaba to take Chihiro's name Kanji, and change her name to Sen. Then she finds a boy named Haku who is really a dragon who befriends and falls in love with Chihiro, their relationship is dangerous to have because dragon spirits are not allowed to talk or have contact near humans. Chihiro then saves her parents and goes back to the normal world.
