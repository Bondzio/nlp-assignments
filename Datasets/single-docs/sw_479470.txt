Chevrolet Traverse

Chevrolet Traverse is a full-sized crossover (CUV) made by General Motors' Chevrolet division. It was introduced for the 2009 model year. Chevrolet markets the Traverse as a minivan (without sliding side doors). The design for the Traverse is loosely based off the concept vehicle the Chevrolet Sequel (a hybrid crossover SUV). It replaced the Uplander (a minivan) and the TrailBlazer (an SUV) in North America. After the Uplander and its siblings failed to match the sales quota of Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey GM announced it would target crossovers. In South America it replaced the Grand Blazer. This vehicle uses a unibody platform called the GM Lambda platform.

In 2013 Traverse was updated with a brand new grille, fascia and Camaro inspired tail lights.
