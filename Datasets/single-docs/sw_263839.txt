Crow

Crows form the genus Corvus in the family Corvidae. They are medium to large sized birds, carnivores and scavengers.

The genus includes the crow (carrion crow or hooded crow), the rook, jay, jackdaw, the magpie and the large common raven. The genus has 40 or so members on all temperate continents except for South America, and some islands. 

The "Corvus" makes up a third of the species in the Corvidae. Crows appear to have evolved in Asia from corvid stock which had evolved in Australia. The collective name for a group of crows is a "flock" or, more poetically, a "murder".

Some crow species not only use tools but also make tools. Crows are now thought to be, with parrots, among the world's most intelligent birds. 

They have a brain size (adjusted for body size) as large as some apes. The jackdaw and the European magpie have a "nidopallium" about the same relative size as the equivalent neocortex in chimpanzees, and significantly larger than is found in the gibbon.

A story of how a girl fed crows, and in return they brought her tiny gifts, shows what the birds are capable of.
