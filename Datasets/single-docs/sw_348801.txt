Peep Show (TV series)

Peep Show is a British television sitcom starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb. It began on 19 September 2003. It was created by Andrew O'Connor, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain. It is written by Armstrong, Bain and Simon Blackwell. Mitchell won a BAFTA Award for his role.

Mitchell plays Mark Corrigan, Webb plays Jeremy Usborne. They are two young men who share a flat in Croydon, London. Mark is a conservative, studious, intelligent, hard-working, cyclothymic, socially awkward loan manager. Jeremy is unemployed, irresponsible, dishonest, lazy, promiscuous and hedonistic. Much of the show's humour is about the difference between the two central characters.
