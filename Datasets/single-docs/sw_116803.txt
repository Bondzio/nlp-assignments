Muhammad bin Qasim al-Thaqafi

Muhammad bin Qasim Al-Thaqafi (, c. 31 December, 695 - 18 July, 715), born Imád-uddín Muhammad bin Qasim bin Yusuf Sakifi, was a Syrian general who attacked the Sindh and Punjab regions along the Indus river (now a part of Pakistan). The conquest of Sindh and Punjab began the Islamic era in South Asia and continues to lend the Sindh province of Pakistan the name "Bab-e-Islam" (The Gateway of Islam).
