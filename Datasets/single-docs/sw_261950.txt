Stroopwafel

A stroopwafel () (English translation: syrup waffle or treacle waffle) is a waffle made from two thin layers of baked batter. It has a caramel-like syrup filling in the middle. They were first made in the town of Gouda in the Netherlands, in 1784. Bigger versions are sold in the streets as a snack.
