Wish You Were Here (album)

Wish You Were Here is a concept album by Pink Floyd. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios between January and July 1975 and released on 15 September 1975. The album would later be thought of as one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums and was ranked 209 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Its lyrics, written by Roger Waters, talked about the music industry, and the market-oriented record companies' not having an understanding and interest for musicians. The album also pays tribute to Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's former guitarist and chief songwriter, especially with "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" and the "Wish You Were Here" title track. The album sold 10 million copies worldwide.
