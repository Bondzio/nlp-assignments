Doctor of Letters

Doctor of Letters (; D.Litt.; Litt.D.; D. Lit.; or Lit. D.) is an academic degree. It is a higher doctorate which, in some countries, may be considered to be beyond the Ph.D. and equal to the Doctor of Science (Sc.D. or D.Sc.). It is awarded in many countries by universities and learned bodies. It is given in recognition of achievement in the humanities, original contribution to the creative arts or scholarship and other merits. Cambridge University requires a candidate to "give proof of distinction by some original contribution to the advancement of science or of learning." When awarded without an application by the conferee, it is awarded as an honorary degree. A Doctor of Letters is a commonly awarded honorary degree.
