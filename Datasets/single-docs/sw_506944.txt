His mother was a Chicana political activist who helped start the Chicano political party, La Raza Unida. She also ran for the San Antonio City Council in 1971, but she did not win. Castro once said, "My mother is probably the biggest reason that my brother and I are in public service. Growing up, she would take us to a lot of rallies and organizational meetings and other things that are very boring for an 8-, 9-, 10-year-old". 

Castro graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio in 1992. He had played football, basketball and tennis. He got an offer to play tennis at Trinity University, an NCAA Division III school in his hometown. He decided instead to go to Stanford University.

Castro entered Harvard Law School in 1997 and graduated with a Juris Doctor law degree in 2000.
