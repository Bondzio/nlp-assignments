OpenNIC

OpenNIC uses an alternative Domain Name System, so users can access more websites than they can on the "normal" internet. Users can still access the "normal" internet.

Users can register website names for free on OpenNIC, whereas doing so on the "normal" internet is usually not free.

The "normal" internet has websites that end in things like ".com", ".org" or ".net" - these endings are called Top Level Domains or TLDs. OpenNIC allows its users to access other website names in addition to those on the "normal" internet.
