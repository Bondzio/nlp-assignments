Sri Lanka at the Olympics

Sri Lanka first took part in the Olympic Games in 1948. 

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Sri Lanka is SRI. In 1964, it was CEY for Ceylon.

Teams took part in all Summer Olympic Games since then, but not the 1976 Games. Sri Lanka never took part in the Winter Olympic Games.

The National Olympic Committee for Sri Lanka was formed in 1937 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year. The nation was called "Ceylon" until 1972.
