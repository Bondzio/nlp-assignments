Type 99 155 mm self-propelled howitzer

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. was the primary contractor, developing the main gun and the turret. The vehicle is powered by a diesel engine.

Type 99s are supplementary to the Type 75 155 mm self-propelled howitzer.

In a period of planned force reduction, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) planning calls for additional Type 99s.
