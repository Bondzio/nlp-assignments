Great Britain was the name given to the United Kingdom team for the 1908 Summer Olympics. It was also given the IOC country code "GBR". The team is also called "Team GB". Representatives of the devolved Northern Ireland government, do not think this is a good name. They think it suggests that Northern Ireland is not part of the British Olympic team, and they think the name should be changed to Team UK. However, British is a correct term for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as, for instance, in "the British Government".
In an agreement between the British and Irish Olympic groups, athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to be a part of the Irish Olympic team. All British people may have dual citizenship if they wish.

London, the United Kingdom's capital, has hosted the Games on three occasions.
