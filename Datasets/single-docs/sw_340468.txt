List of World Heritage Sites in Ecuador

The List of World Heritage Sites in Ecuador is a group of places chosen by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO was created for the "conservation and protection of the worldâ€™s inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science". The constitution of UNESCO was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries, not including Ecuador.

Ecuador agreed to take part in the World Heritage Convention on June 16, 1975.

As of 2012, there are 4 places in Ecuador which are on the World Heritage List. 

There are 7 sites which are on a tentative list.
