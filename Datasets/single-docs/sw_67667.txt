Magnetosphere

A magnetosphere is the region around an astronomical object, like a planet. In this region, the phenomena are greatly influenced by the magnetic field of that object. This is what causes the Northern Lights that shimmer in the night sky near the North Pole. The magnetosphere of the Sun is called the heliosphere.
