List of Jupiter's moons

The planet Jupiter has 69 moons. 46 of these are less than 3Â km wide and probably used to be asteroids before Jupiter's gravity pulled them in. The four biggest moons are called the Galilean moons because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. These four are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto They are roughly the same size as Earth's moon, some are a bit bigger, some are smaller.

This list starts with those that go around Jupiter (orbit) the fastest. That is, they have the shortest orbital period.
