Magenta

Magenta is a color in between red and purple or pink and purple. Sometimes it is confused with pink or purple. In terms of the HSV (RGB) color wheel, it is the color halfway between red and purple and is composed equally of red and blue (50% red and 50% blue). Another name for "magenta" is fuchsia, named after the fuchsia flower.

This colour is one of the three colours of ink used by an inkjet printer, along with cyan and yellow. The tone of magenta used in printing is called "printer's magenta" (Magenta (CMYK)) and it is shown in the colour chart below.

The first written use of "magenta" as a colour name in English was in 1860.
