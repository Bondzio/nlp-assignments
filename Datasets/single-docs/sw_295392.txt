Charles Julius Guiteau (September 8, 1841 â€“ June 30, 1882) was the man who assassinated the 20th President of the United States, James A. Garfield. Guiteau shot Garfield twice in the back because he thought that God had commanded him to kill the president. Guiteau shot Garfield after being angry with him about not receiving credit for Garfield's victory in 1880 after he wrote a speech about Garfield but never made the speech. 

Guiteau was born in Freeport, Illinois. He was a preacher, writer and lawyer. He was found guilty in a court of law. He was executed by hanging in Washington, D.C.
