Boyfriend

A boyfriend is a male partner in a romantic relationship which is not a marriage (for example, a couple who is dating). Partners in a non-married relationship are sometimes called "significant others".

Using the word "boyfriend" to mean "a male partner or lover" was first done in 1906. It became popular in the 1920s, when people started to go out on dates rather than have romantic meetings at home.
