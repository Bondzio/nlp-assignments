Eyedentify

Eyedentify is a PlayStation 3 video game where the player is the controller of a team of game characters using voice recognition via the PlayStation Eye. The game was first announced at E3 2005 in a trailer. A release date hasn't been announced and no further news on development has been released.

Matthew Rorie of Gamespot was guarded about the title being able to achieve the impressive interaction shown in the promotional video, and was unsure if it should be classed as a game or a technology demo.
