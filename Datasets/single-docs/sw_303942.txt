Kuwait at the Olympics

Kuwait has been in 10 Summer Olympic Games. They have never been in the Winter Olympic Games. 

In the 1992 Barcelona Games, Kuwait received a bronze medal in taekwondo. It was only a demonstration sport that year so the medal was not official.

The National Olympic Committee for Kuwait was formed in 1957 and recognized in 1966.
