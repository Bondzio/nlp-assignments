Düren Rural District

Düren is a Kreis (district) in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

The district was created in 1972 by joining the old districts of Jülich and Düren. Both districts date back to 1816 when the new Prussian province of Rhineland was created.

The coat of arms shows the lion from the city of Jülich in the upper part. In the bottom it has a paper roll with the capital letter D for Düren, because the paper industry has long history. The coat of arms were granted in 1942 and confirmed in 1972.
