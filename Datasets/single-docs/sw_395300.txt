Their third album "Victims of this Fallen World" which was released on March 7, 1998, saw a change in musical style from Kataklysm's previous albums. They returned to their former style when they released "The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate)" but it was less chaotic and with a little bit of thrash metal.

Iacono had vocal lessons for the death metal genre after he was complaining that he was losing his voice during or after the band performed concerts. Their fifth studio album "" was released on September 17, 2001. The album featured a little bit of a melodic approach to death metal however they did not step into the boundaries of melodic death metal. The band released their sixth studio album "Shadows & Dust" on October 15, 2002.
