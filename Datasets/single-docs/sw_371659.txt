Cover Drive

Cover Drive is a band with four members from Barbados, featuring Amanda Reifer, T-Ray Armstrong, Barry "Bar-Man" Hill and Jamar Harding.

The band began by performing covers of popular songs and posting them on Youtube. The band was signed by record label Global Talent, part of Polydor Records. They were an opening act for Rihanna on her Loud Tour.

Amanda met T-Ray when she became his babysitter. T-Ray was in the same year at school as Jamar although not in the same school. Amanda met Bar-Man at college because they were in the same year.
