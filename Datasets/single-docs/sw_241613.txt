Melodic hardcore

Melodic hardcore is a subgenre of hardcore punk. Exploring melodies are an important part of melodic hardcore. Gunther "Puddinfoot" Crines described the style as "just so nice". It came out of L.A. hardcore with The Descendants. In 1985, the Descendents worked with two new singers, Dave Smalley of DYS and Dag Nasty. Bad Religion also worked in this style. Another well known melodic hardcore band is Pennywise.
