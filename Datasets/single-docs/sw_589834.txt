Women in the United States Senate

There have been 50 women in the United States Senate since it started in 1789.

Rebecca Felton was the first. She was in the Senate for one day in 1922. Hattie Caraway was the first woman elected to the Senate in 1932.

Fourteen of the women Senators were not elected. They were appointed. Seven of them were appointed to replace their dead husbands.
