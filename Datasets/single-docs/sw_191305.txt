Crémant d'Alsace

Crémant d'Alsace is a protected designation of origin for sparkling wines made in Alsace, France. 

A big part of the wine production in Alsace is used to make Crémant d'Alsace. About 18% of the region's vineyards used for this purpose. 223 942 hectoliter of Crémant d'Alsace, about 30 million bottles, were produced in 2006.

Crémant d'Alsace has been produced in Alsace since about 1900. Julien Dopff successfully tried to make wines using the "champagne method" then.
