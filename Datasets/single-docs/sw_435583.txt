Pope Evaristus

Pope Evaristus is the fifth Pope of the Catholic Church, (the official title is Bishop of Rome). There is very little information about him. He served in Christianity during the years 97-105 C.E.

Author Charles A. Coulombe states that he was a Jew and came from a Jewish family from Antioch, Turkey.

Pope Evaristus is noted for further developing the parishes of the Catholic Church, a work started by Pope Anacletus. He is also credited with ordering that all Churches be consecrated (blessed) by special ceremonies. He created a method of choosing future bishops by the creation of a group which is now known as the College of Cardinals.

He was martyred during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. His feast day is celebrated on October 26.
