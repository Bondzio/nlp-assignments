God Defend New Zealand

"God Defend New Zealand" is one of the national anthems of New Zealand. The other national anthem is "God Save the Queen", but that is not sung very often. Most people in New Zealand call "God Defend New Zealand" ""the" national anthem".

The words were written by Thomas Bracken in the 1870s. On 1 July 1876, the poem appeared in a local newspaper as part of a competition. The competition was to see who could compose the best music to fit the words. The prize was ten guineas. Twelve entries were received, and the winner was a young teacher named John Joseph Woods. It was first performed on Christmas Day, 1876, in Dunedin's Queen's Theatre.

100 years later, 7750 people signed a petition to make "God Defend New Zealand" the national anthem of New Zealand. After this was presented to Parliament, Queen Elizabeth II gave permission for it to become New Zealand's second national anthem, equal to "God Save the Queen".

Usually, only the first verse of the English and the Māori versions are sung, with the Māori first. The Māori version is not a translation of the English version, but was written to fit the melody.
