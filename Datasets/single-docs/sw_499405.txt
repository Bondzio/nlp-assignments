Brooks commented on the album by saying:

""I'm proud, I'm excited, I'm nervous, and it feels good to be back in the game again. This is a very personal album. I only wrote six of the songs, but there are many that are so 'me' that people I work with every day thought I wrote them"".


Sevens debuted at #1 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, becoming his fifth, and #1 on the Top Country Albums, becoming his seventh #1 Country album. In November 2006, Sevens was certified 10 x Platinum by the RIAA.
