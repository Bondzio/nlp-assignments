LazyTown

LazyTown is a television programme aimed at young children. The show is educational and teaches children to be healthy and exercise. The programme was created by people from Iceland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

The show has been very successful, and has aired in many countries around the world, and dubbed into many languages. The show ran from 2004 to 2007, but the United Kingdom has continued the series with "LazyTown Extra", a spin-off of "LazyTown".

The show features live-action actors and puppet characters set in a colourful town called LazyTown. At the start of the show, the town's citizens are very lazy, but the mayor's niece Stephanie arrives to change that. She is aided by an athletic superhero named Sportacus, who teaches the children of the town to eat healthy food and exercise each day. However, their fun is often stopped by the town's laziest man, Robbie Rotten, who spends large amounts of time attempting to make the children lazy again and trying to remove Sportacus and Stephanie from the town, usually by dressing up in disguises to fool the children. Robbie's plans often fail. The show's episodes often involve an educational or important message for viewers, and songs or dance numbers performed by the characters, usually Stephanie being the lead singer or dancer.
