Kokeshi

The doll has a very simple shape;only the head of the globe and the body of the column. A joint of the head and the body was made thin so that a child was easy to grasp it.

"Kokeshi" came to be sold as a souvenir in the "Tohoku" district from "Edo" era.

When the "Taisho" era began, "kokeshi" turned into the role as the appreciation things of adult rather than the toy of the child.

An all-Japan "kokeshi" contest is held every year in May. Since 1954, the annual Prime Minister's prize has been awarded to the best work of creative "kokeshi" makers.

There are 250+ types of "kokeshi".
