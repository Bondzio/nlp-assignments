Brookings Institution

The Brookings Institution is an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. in the United States. One of Washington's oldest think tanks, Brookings conducts research and education in the social sciences, mainly in economics, policy, government, foreign policy, and global economy and development. In the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s "2012 Global go-to think tanks report", Brookings is ranked the most influential think tank in the world.

Its mission is:

Brookings states that its scholars "represent diverse points of view" and describes itself as non-partisan. The media describe Brookings as "liberal-centrist" or "centrist". An analysis of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referenced by conservative politicians almost as often as liberal politicians. It got a score of 53 on a 1-100 scale with 100 the most liberal score. The same study found Brookings to be the most frequently cited think tank by the U.S. media and politicians.
