Body temperature

Body Temperature is the general temperature maintained in the body. Many animals control their body temperature; this is called thermoregulation. For humans, it is generally around 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). Body temperature is usually measured in the mouth, under the armpit or in the anus.
