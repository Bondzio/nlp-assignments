California National Party

The California National Party (CNP) is a proposed political party in the state of California. It has been described by California legislative historian Alex Vassar as "the biggest-promising political party you haven't heard of". It is currently chaired by Theo Slater. The party's main goal is achieving California's independence from the United States of America. Their platform also includes a wide range of proposed reforms. This includes health care, schools and welfare. Many of their proposals are generally left of center and reflect the party's "pragmatic progressive" ideology.
