Mohican

The Mahicans (also Mohicans) are a Native American tribe, who originally settled around the Hudson River. Many then moved to Massachusetts after 1780, before the remaining descendants moved to northeastern Wisconsin during the 1820s and 1830s.
The tribe's name for itself was Muhhekunneuw, or "People of the River."
