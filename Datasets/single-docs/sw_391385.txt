Dryadoideae

The Dryadoideae subfamily of the Rosaceae consists of four genera. These genera are unusual in the family Rosaceae because they all have the nitrogen-fixing bacteria called "Frankia" in their roots. Dryadoideae plants are subshrubs, shrubs, or small trees. Their fruits are either an achene or an aggregate of achenes.
