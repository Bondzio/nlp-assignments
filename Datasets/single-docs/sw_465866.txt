21st Century Fox

21st Century Fox (Twenty-First Century Fox) is an American multinational mass media corporation. 

It is one of two companies made from the 2013 split of News Corporation (founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979). 21st Century Fox has the broadcasting and film assets and serves as the legal successor to News Corporation. The publishing assets were spun off to form News Corp at the same time. The split was so both companies operate under more "focused" management, which Murdoch claimed would "unlock" their true value.

Among the holdings of 21st Century Fox are Fox Entertainment Group. This owns the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network. There are other assets, such as the pan-Asian pay channel operator STAR TV.
