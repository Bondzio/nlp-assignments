Tappan Zee Bridge

The Tappan Zee Bridge is a bridge in lower New York. It is three miles long. It goes across the Hudson River. It connects Westchester and Rockland Counties. The bridge opened in 1955. It took traffic from other bridges and ferries in the area. The bridge is about 25 miles north of New York City. The city can be seen from the bridge on a clear day. The bridge carries seven lanes of the New York State Thruway.

The bridge is named for a Native American tribe from the area called the "Tappan". "Zee" is the Dutch word for "sea", as the bridge crosses water.

Because the bridge is old and now gets a lot of traffic, it needs to be replaced with something safer and larger. People in the region have been arguing to build the new bridge for many years.

In 2013, the New York State Thruway Authority began building the New Tappan Zee Bridge. It will be a double-span bridge (four lanes per span in opposite directions) with designated bus lanes. The new bridge is planned to be ready to open in 2018.

An October 14, 2012, "Newsday" article reports the Tappan Zee Bridge has been referred to as the Golden Gate Bridge of the East because of many suicide jumpers. The article says "The new Tappan Zee, which is in the works, will include fencing designed to thwart jumpers."
