César Chávez Day

César Chávez Day is a state holiday in California, Colorado and Texas observed on March 31. The holiday is to remember the life of Cesar Chavez and his civic involvement. All state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed, except for K-12 schools. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger suspended observance of the holiday in 2004 and 2005 to save money during the aftermath of the power crisis. It is an optional holiday in Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, and New Mexico. Californians celebrate this holiday by planting lilies in their front yard.
