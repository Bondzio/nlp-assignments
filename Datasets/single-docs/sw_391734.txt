Demarchy

Demarchy is a political system based on many decision-making groups that deal with specific functions in a given area (transport, parks, land use, etc.) The members that make up each group are chosen randomly every year.

This system is advantageous due to the lack of susceptibility to pressure groups, media and others. In demarchy "political machines" or special preparation of candidates is not important because nobody can predict who will be in government next.
