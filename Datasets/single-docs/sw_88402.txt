Intellectual

An intellectual is one who tries to use his or her intellect to work, study, reflect, speculate, or ask and answer questions about a wide variety of different ideas. Often, intellectuals are authors, artists, people who write columns for newspapers and magazines, and college professors.

There are some people who do not like intellectuals because they are not traditional or practical. This is called "anti-intellectualism".
