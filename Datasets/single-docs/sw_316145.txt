Rosetta (spacecraft)

Rosetta is an ESA space probe. It is on a mission to study the comet 67P/Churyumovâ€“Gerasimenko. The Rosetta mission is made up of two parts: the Rosetta space probe and the Philae lander. The spacecraft was launched on 2 March 2004 by an Ariane 5 rocket. In 12 November 2014 Philae landed but soon lost electrical power and radio contact. Rosetta continued to examine the comet from orbit.
