Chivalric romance

Chivalric romances are stories, poems or songs. They were written about marvel-filled adventures. Knights having heroic qualities went on quests. It is the emphasis on love and courtly manners which distinguishes it from other kinds of epic. Other types of epic are about masculine military heroism.

Romances were written in European languages of the Middle Ages.

The best known romance was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" is another example.
