Mikawa Province

Mikawa had borders with Owari, Mino, Shinano, and Tōtōmi Provinces.

In the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road was the main route between the Imperial capital at Kyoto and the main city of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The road passed through Mikawa.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Mikawa Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Toga jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Mikawa.
