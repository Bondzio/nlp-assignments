Gödel's incompleteness theorems

Gödel's incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems, proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931. They are theorems in mathematical logic.

In a formal system, there are axioms. All axioms are assumed to be true, at any rate for the purpose of the logic. A theorem then comes up with "other true statements from the axioms", using certain rules. A sequence of such statements is called a "proof" of a statement, because it shows that the statement is true, given the axioms. 

Ideally, it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner. A system that has this property is called "complete"; one that does not is called "incomplete". Another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions. This means that it is not possible to prove that a statement is true and false at the same time. A system that does not include theories that allow this is called "consistent".

Gödel said that "every non-trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent": 

Most people think this shows that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible. This would give a negative answer to Hilbert's second problem.
