New Netherland

New Netherland (Dutch: "Nieuw-Nederland", Latin: "Nova Belgica" or "Novum Belgium") was a colony of the Dutch Empire from 1614 through 1664 and from 1673 through 1674. It was a base for the fur trade. The capital was New Amsterdam, modern-day New York City. The other important trading post in New Netherland was Fort Orange, now called Albany, New York. Most settlers lived in these towns or between them, along the Hudson River but some lived in distant parts of the colony. 

During the Anglo-Dutch Wars England conquered New Netherland and divided it to make the English colonies of New York and New Jersey. The English also gave parts of it to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.
