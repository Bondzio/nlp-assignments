Great Flood of 1993

The Great Flood of 1993 was a major natural disaster. It affected nine states, mostly between April and September 1993. It involved the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.

Storms with heavy rain began hitting the same locations over and over again. This pattern began repeating in late April and early May. It lasted until September in some areas. Eastern Iowa, Missouri and Illinois were especially hard-hit. 

The flood was the costliest in the history of the United States. Damage totaled $15 billion, although some estimates go as high as $20 billion.

There were thirty-two deaths because of the flood. Some estimates put the death toll at 50.
