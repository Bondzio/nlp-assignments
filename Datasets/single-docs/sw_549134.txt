Llullaico

Llullaillaco is a potentially active volcano at the border of Argentina (Salta Province) and Chile. It is the seventh highest mountain of the Andes.

It lies in the Puna de Atacama, a region of very high volcanic peaks on a high plateau within the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world.

It id known that Incas climbed Llullaillaco in the pre-Columbian period. The first recorded ascent was on 1 December 1952, by Bión González and Juan Harseim, from Chile.

During 1983–1985, American archaeologist Johan Reinhard directed three surveys of archaeological sites on the summit and slopes of the mountain.

In 1999 on Llullaillaco's summit, an Argentine-Peruvian expedition co-directed by Johan Reinhard and Argentine archaeologist Constanza Ceruti found the preserved bodies of three Inca children approximately 500 years earlier.

The volcano is in the Chile-Argentina boder and is part, on the Chilean part, of the Llullaillaco National Park ().

The Llullaillaco is a stratovolcano. There were eruptions in 1854, 1866 and 1877. Since then, no volcanic activity has been recorded. It is the world´s second highest active volcano, second to "Ojos del Salado".

It is an ultra-prominent peak, or Ultra for short, because it has as a summit with a topographic prominence of or more.
