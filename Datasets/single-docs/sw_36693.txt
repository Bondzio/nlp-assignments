Bovid

Bovids are a family of even-toed ungulate mammals. Even-toed ungulates are said to have "cloven hooves": that just means their hooves are formed from two toes.

There almost 140 species in this family. They include cattle, goats, sheep and antelopes. The family is widespread, living in continents except South America, Australia and Antarctica.

They are all ruminants, with the double stomach system of digesting vegetation, which is most efficient. The family originated in the Miocene, and is now very successful. Their success, and that of the three domestic animals (cow, sheep and goat) is probably helped by their digestive system.
