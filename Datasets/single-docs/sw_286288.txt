Aristide Briand

Aristide Briand (; 28 March 1862 â€“ 7 March 1932) became the Prime Minister of France in 1909. He participated in the movement for labour-union formation and also in drafting the law of separation of church and state. Briand was criticised for trying to make peace with Germany. However, it was Briand who played a leading role in formulating the Locarno Pact, a treaty intended to establish peace in western Europe and ease relations with Germany.
