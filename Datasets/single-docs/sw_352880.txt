UEFA Euro 1972

The 1972 UEFA European Football Championship final tournament was held in Belgium. This was the fourth European Football Championship. The championship is held every four years and endorsed by UEFA. The final tournament took place between 14 and 18 June 1972. 

At the time, only four countries could play the final tournament. So there were only the semi-finals, the final and the third place match.

The hosts were only announced after the qualifying round. This meant that they had to qualify for the final stage.

There were 10 goals scored in 4 matches.
