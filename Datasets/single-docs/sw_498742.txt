Greater prairie chicken

The greater prairie chicken ("Tympanuchus cupido"), also known as a boomer, is a large bird in the grouse family. They come from North America. There used to be many of them. Because of habitat destruction, there are few left in some parts of its range. In other parts, there are none at all. People are trying to save the ones that are left.

Adults of both sexes are medium to large birds. They are similar to chickens. They have round wings and short tails.
