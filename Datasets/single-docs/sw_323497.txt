Moorabbin Airport

Moorabbin (Harry Hawker) Airport is an airport for light aircraft located in Mentone, Victoria, Australia. The airport is a suburb, with its own postcode "3194". The airport opened in December 1949. It was going to be called "Mentone" but this was too similar to the then French airport Menton. The name Cheltenham was too similar to the UK airport Gloucester/Cheltenham. The name comes from the nearby suburb of Moorabbin, Victoria. Moorabbin Airport is the third busiest airport in Australia by aircraft movements.

Moorabbin Airport has five intersecting runways, an air museum, helicopter terminals, a control tower and several flight training facilities. Moorabbin Airport serves the general aviation needs for the south-eastern of Melbourne and King Island.
