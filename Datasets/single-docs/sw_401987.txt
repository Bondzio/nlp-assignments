Elkanah Settle

Elkanah Settle (1648-1724) was an English poet and playwright. He was born at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England, the son of Josias Settle. In 1666, he went to Trinity College, Oxford, but did not take a degree. 

His first tragedy was "Cambyses, King of Persia" (1667). It was the first English play to have its climax reached in a musical scene with an original score. It is believed to be the first play printed in England with illustrations. 

Settle was briefly involved in politics when the succession of Catholic James II to the throne was being debated. He served briefly in James's army. He then abandoned politics. 

In 1691, he was named City Poet of London. His last days were spent as a poor brother in the Carthusian Order. He may have performed in street fairs as a dragon in a green leather suit. He died in 1724.
