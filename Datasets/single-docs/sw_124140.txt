WarioWare: Twisted!

WarioWare: Twisted! is a 2004 Game Boy Advance video game. It was made by Nintendo and is art of the WarioWare series.

"Twisted!" comes with a gyro sensor. The cartridge is a lot larger than in most Game Boy Advance games. Players tap the A button and twist the game around in order to play. 

Like the other games, "Twisted!" has many microgames. These last for only a few seconds and involve a simple thing the player must do. The player starts with four lives. After about 12-15 microgames, he or she plays the boss level. If they win, they earn another life. If they lose, they lose a life. The game ends when they have run out of lives.

Wario has gotten seven of his friends to help make games for him. Each one has a different theme, or way to play.
