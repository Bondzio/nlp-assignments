Desmond Tutu

Archbishop Desmond Tutu (born 7 October 1932) is a South African social rights activist. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his work fighting apartheid in South Africa. He was the first Anglican bishop in Cape Town.

Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, Transvaal. When Tutu was twelve he moved with his family to Johannesburg. Tutu wanted to become a doctor. His family could not afford to send him to medical school, so Tutu studied at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College to become a teacher. He taught at Johannesburg Bantu High School and at Munsienville High School in Mogale City.

Tutu married Nomalizo Lea Shenxane on 2 July 1955. In 1975 he moved into what is now known as Tutu House in Soweto.
