Scots Wikipedia

The Scots Wikipedia () is the Scots-language edition of Wikipedia. This edition was started in June 2005. As of December 2013, it has over 18,000 articles.

The Scots is a dialect of English, not a separate language. Scottish Gaelic, spoken on some of the Scottish islands, is a distinctly different language.
