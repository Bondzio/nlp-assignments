Sanitation

Sanitation means having ways to safely deal with human waste (feces and urine). It also includes ways to maintain hygiene by disposing of garbage, treating wastewater and managing hazardous waste. Sanitation is important because it helps prevent the spread of germs and diseases.

In poor countries, people have poor sanitation because they do not have good toilets. They also do not have good sewage systems. In developed countries, people have good sanitation because they have a sewage system to filter all the toxins from the water. The use of toilets protects the health of a community by keeping germs out of the environment.
