LGBT rights in the United States

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights in the United States have changed over time, and different states have different rules about them. Sexual acts between adults (depending on the age of consent in each state. This varies from age 16 to 21), and adolescents of an age close to an adult, of the same sex have been legal in the U.S. since 2003. 

Family, marriage, and anti-discrimination laws are different in every state. Six states plus Washington, D.C. currently allow same-sex marriage. Maryland does not allow same-sex marriage but does allow people of the same sex who were married in other places to stay married.

Twenty-one states plus Washington, D.C. have made discrimination because of sexual orientation illegal. Sixteen states plus Washington, D.C. have made discrimination because of gender identity or expression illegal. Hate crimes because ofsexual orientation or gender identity can also be punished under Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. 

Human Rights Campaign is the biggest LGBT-rights group in the U.S.
