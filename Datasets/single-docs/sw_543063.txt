Flag of Chile

The national flag of Chile was adopted in 1817.

The flag shows two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center.

Protocol dictates that it can hang horizontally or vertically, but the star must always be located in the top-left corner.

Note: the Chilean flag is similar to the flag of the state of Texas.
