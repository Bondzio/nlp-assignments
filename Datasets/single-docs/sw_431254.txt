Peppered corydoras

The Peppered corydoras ("Corydoras paleatus") is a freshwater catfish. 

The Peppered corydoras live at the bottom of the fish tank. They are peaceful community fish. They like to live in a temperature of around 25–28°C. They should be kept in groups of other corydoras. They grow to about 7 centimetres.

The Peppered corydoras are scavengers. They eat the fish food after it sinks to the bottom of the tank.
