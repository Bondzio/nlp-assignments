Kichijōji

Kichijōji also has some famous landmarks. Inokashira Park, for example, is in the south part of the district, and is a favorite place for springtime "hanami", or to see cherry-blossoms. The Kanda River (神田川) begins to flow from this park. The Seikei University (成蹊大学), one of Tokyo's biggest private universities, is in the northwestern area of the neighborhood.
