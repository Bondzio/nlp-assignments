Leonid Plyushch (Ukrainian: Плющ Леонід Іванович; 26 April 1938 – 4 June 2015) was a Ukrainian mathematician and Soviet dissident. Plyushch became a dissident by taking a public stance on political hot topics of the time. He was arrested in January 1972 on charges of anti-Soviet activity, and was jailed for a year before his trial began.

Plyushch was born into a Ukrainian working-class family in 1938 in Naryn, Kirghizia. He died on 4 June 2015 in France, aged 77.
