Russian Air Force

The Russian Air Force is the air wing of the Russian Military. It is the world's second largest air force after the United States Air Force. It is also the only air force other than the United States Air Force who use modern strategic bombers.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Air Force (and Air Defense Force) were as big as the United States Air Force. However, after the collapse of Soviet Union, the Russian Air Force was made much smaller because Russia did not have enough money to keep everything. However, spending on the Russian Air Force increased in the early 21st century.
