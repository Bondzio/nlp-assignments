Doedicurus

Doedicurus was an ancient armadillo are belonging to the family Glyptodontidae. Fossils have been found in Patagonia, in South America. These herbivores (plant-eaters) may have been preyed upon by saber-toothed cats and borhyaenids (extinct dog-like meat-eaters). "Doedicurus" lived during the Ice Ages, during the Pleistocene between 2 million and 15,000 years ago.
