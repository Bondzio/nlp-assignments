Houston Texans

The Houston Texans are a professional American National Football League team in Houston, Texas. They are part of the American Football Conference (AFC). The Texans joined the NFL in 2002 as an expansion team. 

The team is, of course, named for their home state. There was another "Texans" team in the early 1960s, the Dallas Texas. That team move and became the Kansas City Chiefs. The first NFL team in Houston was the "Oilers". The Oilers moved to Tennessee and were renamed the "Titans". The Texans were created in order to replace the Oilers in Houston.
