Branle

The branle is an old French dance of the 16th century. Though French in origin, it spread to most of western Europe. Spelling varies greatly: "bransle", "brangle", "brawl", "brawle", "brall"(e), "braul"(e), or (Scot.) "brantle". 

There are few descriptions of the dance steps. It is a sequence dance performed with partners in lines or circles. In John Marston's "The Malcontent" (1604), act 4, scene 2, the character Guerrino describes the steps of a dance called "Beanchaes brawl" (Bianca's branle): t'is but two singles on the left, two on the right, three doubles forward, a trauerse of six round: do this twice, three singles side, galliard tricke of twentie, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken downe, come vp, meete two doubles, fall backe, and then honour. 

A more detailed and more accessible account is given of the Scots branle by the dance historian Melusine Wood.

The music for the dance was written in 4/4 time. An example, "Music for the Scots' Branle", is given by both Arbeau and Wood.
