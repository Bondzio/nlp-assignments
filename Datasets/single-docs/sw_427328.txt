Pope Saint Leo IV (790 â€“ 17 July 855) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 10 April 847 until he died in 855. 

He was born in Rome. He died in Rome on 17 July 855 and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. There was a medieval tradition that had claimed that a woman, Pope Joan, had succeeded him by disguising herself as a man but she is believed to be fictitious.
