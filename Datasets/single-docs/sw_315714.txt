Xiangsheng

Crosstalk, also known by its Chinese name xiangsheng (Simplified Chinese: 相声, Traditional Chinese: 相聲, pinyin: "xiàngsheng", literally, "looking at each other and speaking"), is a traditional Chinese comedy form. Crosstalk is a special kind of dialogue and a special kind of performance.

The comic language has many puns and allusions. The words are spoken in a fast, rushed manner. The comedy is a kind of banter. 

According to Canadian crosstalk comedian Dashan (Mark Rowswell), the closest equivalent in English would be Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" sketch.

Modern crosstalk is made up of four skills–speaking (Simplified Chinese: 说, Traditional Chinese: 說, pinyin: "shuō"), imitating (Simplified Chinese: 学, Traditional Chinese: 學, pinyin: "xué"), teasing (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 逗, pinyin: "dòu"), and singing (Simplified and Traditional chinese: 唱, pinyin: "chàng").

Crosstalk was popular during the Qing Dynasty. It is also a standard feature of CCTV's annual New Year's Gala.
