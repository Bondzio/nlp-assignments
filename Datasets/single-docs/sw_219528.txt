Survivor: All-Stars

Survivor: All-Stars was the eighth season of the American reality show "Survivor". It was filmed in 2003 and started to be shown on TV on February 1, 2004 after Super Bowl XXXVIII. It was set on the Pearl Islands of Panama, the same place where the last season, "" had just finished. The winner of this season was Amber Brkich, who won against Rob "Boston Rob" Mariano, fellow player and future husband in a 4-3 vote. At the end of the season a twist called "" was shown live on May 13, 2004. It involved the public voting for whom they wanted to win a second million-dollar prize. Rupert Boneham won the million dollars.

Rob Mariano, Rupert Boneham, Jerri Manthey and Colby Donaldson returned in "", each on "Survivor" for a third time. Their places are unknown because the season has not been shown on TV yet.

This season became available on DVD on September 14, 2004.

Producer Mark Burnett has said that two people said no when they were asked to return in the "All-Stars" season of "Survivor" â€” Elisabeth Filarski Hasselbeck from "", who had just taken a job as a co-host of "The View", and Colleen Haskell of the show's , who "had moved on with her life and just genuinely didn't want to go through that again." There was a rumor that Brian Heidik, from "" was asked to return, but he would only return if he would be paid a certain amount of money for returning, no matter how far he got into the game. "" winner Sandra Diaz-Twine also says that she said no, saying that she was still from parasites that she got at Pearl Islands. Jon Dalton has says that he said no. Jenna Morasca, winner "" said that her fellow tribemate, Heidi Strobel, had also said no.

Burnett jokingly said that "the casting was really, really scientific. I got a yellow legal pad and wrote down 24 names, and [then] cut down to 18. It was that quick."

Eighteen players returned this season from earlier seasons. In the beginning, they were divided into three tribes: Chapera, Mogo Mogo, and Saboga. Each tribe was named after an island of the Pearl Islands. During the fifth episode Reward Challenge, the Saboga tribe lost the award, and its members divided between the other two tribes (called "dissolving"). During this period, an alliance between Rob M, Amber (who already had their own alliance early in the game), Rupert and Jenna L. would become dominate for Chapera. Also, during this time, two players chose to leave the game. Jenna Morasca, who was worried about her mother's health, chose to leave the game. Her mother died eight days later from cancer. Susan "Sue" Hawk left angry in episode six, one day after a problem during an immunity challenge where a naked Richard Hatch had quick but inappropriate bodily contact with her.

When ten players were left, the tribes were switched. The players grabbed a random new buff out of a bag. By chance, each player drew a buff of the opposite tribe color except Amber. When Chapera lost the next immunity challenge, Rob M. whispered a deal to Lex to save Amber, promising that he will make it up to him later in the game. Lex convinced the rest of Chapera to vote out Jerri instead of Amber. The next day, the players that were left merged (combined) into one tribe, which they named "Chaboga Mogo" (a combination of the old tribe names), and Rob M. decided to vote off Lex, even though he was breaking his promise. 

Rob's four-player alliance continued to dominate the rest of the game. When there were five players left, Rob M., Amber, Rupert, Jenna L., and Big Tom, Rob M. started an argument between Rupert and Big Tom, leading to Big Tom being voted off at the next Tribal Council, and Rupert at the next one. Rob M. won the last immunity challenge and took Amber into the final two with him. The members of the jury had different opinions, some saying that Rob M. played a strong game to get this far, while others, such as Lex, didn't like him because of his strategies. At the live show, before the reading of the votes, Rob M. proposed to Amber for her hand in marriage, and she said yes. Amber won the last vote, 4-3. As winner, Amber was given the chance to give a car to another player, and she chose Shii Ann, At the reunion, "" player Jerri Manthey tried to put herself into the controversial discussion between Tom Buchanan and Mariano. The 5000 person audience booed, so she left the reunion show angry during a commercial break.

A week later, Rupert won the "America Votes" contest, getting 85% of the 38 million votes cast, winning a million dollars himself.
