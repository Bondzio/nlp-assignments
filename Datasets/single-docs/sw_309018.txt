Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan

The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was the name the Taliban used for Afghanistan when they controlled it. This was from 1996 until 2001, when the United States took over from the Taliban. The Taliban never controlled all of Afghanistan. The United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (the Northern Alliance) controlled a small part of the country in the north.
