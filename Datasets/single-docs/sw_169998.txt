Camp Nou

Camp Nou (also known as the Nou Camp) is a football stadium used by FC Barcelona that was opened on 1957. It can hold 99,354 people, making it the largest stadium in Europe and second largest football stadium in the world. 

The stadium was used to host the 1982 FIFA World Cup and the 1992 Summer Olympics. It also hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich. 

Renovations are to be made for the stadium that would increase the capacity by 13,000 people (which would be about 112,000 capacity). If the renovations will be made, the stadium would be the second largest stadium in the world.
