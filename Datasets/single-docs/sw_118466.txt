Interception (football)

An interception or intercept is a move in football that happens when a player on one team catches a ball from the quarterback instead of the intented receiver. When this is done, the player's team who had caught the ball, would get possession of it. Many leagues use interceptions, some are Canadian and American football football, as well as rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules football and Gaelic football. The most common players to get interceptions are defensive backs.
