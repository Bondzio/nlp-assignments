Werra

The Werra is a river in the central part of Germany. The Werra has its source near "Fehrenbach" in Thuringia. After 293 km, the Werra joins the Fulda River in Hann. Münden, making the Weser. The Werra valley ("Werratal") makes a natural border between the Rhön hills and the Thuringian Forest.
