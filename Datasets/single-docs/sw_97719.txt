Sonic the Hedgehog (video game)

Sonic the Hedgehog, sometimes called Sonic, is the first video game in the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series. It was made by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. It has many sequels and spin-offs. The beta/prototype (proto) version got made in 1987.

To try and steal six chaos emeralds located in South Island, Dr. Ivo Robotnik (the villain) has trapped the animals living on South Island in robots. The player is controlling Sonic, who's goal is to free the animals and obtaining the emeralds himself.

If you have collected all the emeralds, you will be rewarded with a good ending. If you do not collect all of the emeralds, the ending will show Robotnik juggling the emeralds that you have not collected.
