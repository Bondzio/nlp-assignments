Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text (filler text) in publishing and graphic design. It is used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document, such as font, typography, and layout. 

The lorem ipsum text is usually a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed to make it nonsensical. Lorem ipsum text is used in mock-ups of visual design projects before the actual words are put into the finished product. This is often called greeking. The text is derived from Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum" ("On the Ends of Goods and Evils", sometimes the title is translated as "[About] The Purposes of Good and Evil" ). 

The text was frequently used in desktop publishing templates. To experiment with the text, it can be copy-pasted into the desktop publishing software, and the typeface and its setting can be tried out. The distribution of letters in lorem ipsum is close to that in English language. This way, you can see what your own text would look like in that graphic format.
