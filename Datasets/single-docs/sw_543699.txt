The Delta IV is a rocket made to launch satellites. It has many different types including Medium, Medium+, and Heavy for many different types of satellites orbiting at many different altitudes above the Earth. The Delta IV launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

The Delta IV has launched 32 times. The first flight was on November 20, 2002, and it launched the "Eutelsat W5" communications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

The Delta IV rocket comes in many different types meant to launch different sizes and kinds of satellites.
The least powerful kind of the Delta IV rocket is the Medium type. It has 1 main Common Booster Core (CBC) as the first stage of the rocket, using the RS-68 engine, and the second stage is like from the Delta III rocket, but it has been changed. It uses a 4-meter payload fairing to cover the satellite during the launch of the rocket. This kind has launched 3 times.
The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) is like the Medium type, but it has two GEM-60 solid rocket boosters strapped onto the CBC. This kind has launched 13 times, and is the kind of Delta IV rocket that has launched the most times.

The Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) is like the (4,2), but the second stage and fairing has a larger diameter. This kind has launched 2 times.

The Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) is like the (5,2), but it has two more GEM-60 solid rocket boosters. This kind has launched 5 times.

The Delta IV Heavy is the biggest kind of Delta IV rockets. It has two CBC strapped onto it like solid rocket boosters. This kind has launched 9 times, and is the most powerful rocket currently doing launches (the most powerful rocket ever is the Saturn V).
