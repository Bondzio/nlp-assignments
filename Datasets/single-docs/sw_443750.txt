Henry Moseley

Moseley worked on many theories about the atomic number. This soon became known as Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law helped prove many ideas in chemistry by organizing the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a quite logical order based on their physics. 

Moseley was shot and killed during the Battle of Gallipoli on 10 August 1915, at the age of 27. Some people say that he could have won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1916 if he was never killed.
