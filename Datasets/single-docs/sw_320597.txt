Roger Bannister

Sir Roger Gilbert Bannister, CBE (born 23 March 1929) is an English athlete, physician and educator. He is best known for being the first person to run the mile in less than four minutes. Many people thought this was impossible, a natural limit of the human body, until he did it in 1954. 

Bannister was born in Harrow, Middlesex. He was the first recipient of the "Sports Illustrated" "Sportsman of the Year" award in January 1955. He was a neurologist and Master of Pembroke College, Oxford. He retired in 2001. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011.
