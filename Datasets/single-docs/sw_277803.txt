Mountain (band)

Mountain are an American hard rock band. The band was formed when Leslie West, formerly from the Long Island R&B band The Vagrants had recorded a solo album entitled "Mountain" (which was a reference to West's one-time physical bulk) and had former Cream collaborator and bassist Felix Pappalardi producing it and former Remains drummer N.D. Smart. The current members of the band are Leslie West (lead vocals, guitar), Corky Laing (Drums, percussion), Rev Jones (bass). They are probably best known for their song, "Mississippi Queen" which was also featured in the video games, and Rock Band.
