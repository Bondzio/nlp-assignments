William G. Morgan

William George Morgan (23 January 1870 â€“ 27 December 1942) was an American educator and businessman. He was the inventor of volleyball, originally called "Mintonette". He was born in Lockport, New York. 

He met James Naismith, inventor of basketball, while Morgan was studying at Springfield College, Massachusetts in 1892. Like Naismith, Morgan went for a career in Physical Education at the YMCA. He was inspired by Naismith and basketball, in 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Morgan invented "Mintonette" a less harder team sport than basketball which was more suitable for older members of the YMCA but one that still needed athletic skill.

Morgan died in Lockport, New York from pneumonia on 27 December 1942, aged 72.
