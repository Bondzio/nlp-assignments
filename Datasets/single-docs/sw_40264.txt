Speaker of the United States House of Representatives

The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the leader of the United States House of Representatives. He is elected by the current members of the House and the person with the most votes becomes Speaker. The current Speaker of the House is Republican Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

The Speaker has always been a member of the majority party (the party with the most members) but does not have to be an elected member of the House (this has not happened yet). The job of the Speaker is to keep the House in order and to assign committee memberships and chairmanships. It is an important and powerful position in government.

Sam Rayburn is the only person to have served as Speaker of the House for more than ten years.

Theodore M. Pomeroy served as Speaker of the House for one day after Speaker Schuyler Colfax resigned to become Vice President of the United States; Pomeroy's term as a Member of Congress ended the next day.

Sam Rayburn, Henry Clay, Thomas Brackett Reed, Joseph William Martin, Jr., Frederick Muhlenberg, and John W. Taylor are the only Speakers of the House to have ever served in non-consecutive Congresses (i.e. another Speaker served in between each tenure).

The Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency of the United States. If the President of the United States dies or steps down, the Vice President of the United States becomes President. If there is no vice president, the Speaker of the House automatically becomes acting president. This has never happened.

It includes the congressional district and political affiliation of each speaker as well as the number of their Congress and time they spent in the position. 

Since the retirement of John Boehner on October 29, 2015 there are four former living speakers.
