Volcanic belt

A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active place. Volcanic belts are found above zones of very high temperature (700-1400Â°C) where magma is made by melting of rock in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually appear along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10-50 km.
