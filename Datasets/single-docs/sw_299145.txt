Mauritius at the Olympics

Mauritius was first at the Olympic Games in 1984. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then. The nation has never been in the Winter Olympic Games. Mauritius also supported the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics.

The National Olympic Committee for Mauritius was formed in 1971 by Ram Ruhee, who remained its Secretary General until 2008. It was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1972.
