Fidget spinner

A fidget spinner is a toy that some people believe helps children who can become distracted. Gadget World has published a blog to explain the alleged benefits. However, other people such as teachers believe that fidget spinners are a distraction. 

Catherine Hettinger, a chemical engineer, was first credited by some news stories to have been the inventor of the fidget spinner, including by media outlets such as "The Guardian", "The New York Times" and the "New York Post". Hettinger filed a patent application for a "spinning toy" in 1993.
