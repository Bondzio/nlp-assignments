Aït Benhaddou

Aït Benhaddou is a fortified city along the caravan route between the Sahara and Marrakech, in Morocco. Today, very few people live in the city. Most have moved to more modern cities. It has been an ideal place for movies to be filmed due to its scenery and lack of people. Many famous movies were shot there, including "Marco Polo", "The Mummy", and "Prince of Persia".
