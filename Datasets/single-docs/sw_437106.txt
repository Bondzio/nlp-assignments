Chicago Stadium

The Chicago Stadium was an indoor sports arena and theater in Chicago, Illinois. It opened in 1929, and closed in 1994. It was demolished in 1995 because the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls moved to the United Center.

The Stadium hosted the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL from 1929–1994 and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 1967–1994.

The arena was the site of the first NFL playoff game in 1932; the 1932, 1940, and 1944 Democratic National Conventions; and the 1932 and 1944 Republican National Conventions.
