Baure language

Bauré is an Arawakan language native to Bolivia. The language is nearly extinct. It is spoken by only 40 of the thousand Baure people. These people live in the Beni Department northwest of Magdalena, Bolivia. Some parts of the Bible have been translated into Baure. Most Baure people now speak Spanish.

Baure has an active–stative syntax.
