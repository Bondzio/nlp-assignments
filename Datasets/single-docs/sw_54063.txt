Banská Bystrica

Banská Bystrica (German: "Neusohl", Hungarian: "Besztercebánya", Latin: "Villa Nova"), is a large town in central Slovakia, on the Hron river.

It was first mentioned in 1255 as a royal free mining town. The town had rich ore deposits, mainly copper, and to a lesser extent silver, gold and iron. As the deposits were depleted, the town has reoriented to the industry. During the World War II, the Slovak National Uprising broke out in the town.
