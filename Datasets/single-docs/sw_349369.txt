Mount Kosciuszko

Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain in Australia. The mountain is above sea level. The mountain is in the south east corner of New South Wales, where it is part of the Great Dividing Range. The Indigenous Australians called the whole mountain Tar-gan-gil. The first European to discover the mountain was the Polish explorer, Count Paul Strzelecki in 1840. He named it Kosciuszko after the Polish patriot, Thaddeus Kosciuszko (1746 - 1817).

Mount Kosciuszko is now part of the large Koscuiszko National Park.
