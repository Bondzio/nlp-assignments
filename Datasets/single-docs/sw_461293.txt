Current affairs

Current affairs is a type of broadcast journalism that analyzes and discusses recent News stories. This can include news that is still happening. Most of the discussion is on why, where and how a story has happened. This is different from normal news programmes that report news stories as quickly as they can. They usually do not have as much analysis as current affairs programmes. It is also different from the magazine show format, where events are discussed immediately. The Current affairs shows are becoming less popular. The audience for these shows is usually over age 50.
