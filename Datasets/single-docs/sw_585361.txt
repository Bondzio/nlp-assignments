Anna Halprin

Anna Dorothy Halprin (born Anna Schuman; 13 July 1920) is an American dancer. She helped pioneer the experimental art form known as postmodern dance and referred to herself as the breaker of modern dance. 

Halprin, along with her contemporaries such as Trisha Brown, Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, John Cage, and Robert Morris, collaborated and built a community based around the ideas of post-modern dance. In the 1950s, she established the San Francisco Dancersâ€™ Workshop to give artists like her a place to practice their art.
