Pokémon Red and Blue

The games are set in the fantasy world of Kanto and follow the adventure of the main character, Red, in his quest to learn Pokémon battling. Both games have almost the same plot, but the player must trade among the two in order to complete the games' Pokédex. The Kanto Saga of the Pokémon anime is based on the games' plots.

"Pokémon Red" and "Blue" are turn-based role-playing games.

"Pokémon Yellow", a special version, was released one year later in each region. "Pokémon Red" and "Blue" have later been remade for the Game Boy Advance as "Pokémon FireRed" and "LeafGreen", released in 2004.

"Pokémon Red" and "Blue" got good reviews, and their releases started the beginning of what would become a multi-billion dollar company, both selling millions of copies around the world.
