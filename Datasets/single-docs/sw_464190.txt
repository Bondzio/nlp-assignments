Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded

Conker: Live and Reloaded (originally known as Conker: Live and Uncut, but it was actually more censored) is a platform game on the original Xbox. The game is a remake of the N64 game "Conker's Bad Fur Day". 

The game has much better graphics, thanks to the Xbox's superior hardware. It has new enemies. It has a few changes in design. It has an improved multiplayer mode which supports System Link as well as Local Play and Solo with bots. It also supported Xbox Live before the original Xbox lost support for Xbox Live. 

The game does not have some profanity that was in the original game.
