Jumanji

Jumanji is a 1995 movie starring Robin Williams, which was based loosely on a 1982 children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg. It is about a boy who gets trapped in a game for 30 years, and must finish playing the game when he gets out. Other stars include Kirsten Dunst. In the "Flying Hunter Van Pelt" scene, Roland D-50's PN-D50-02 patch "Fast Forward" was heard.

The game in the movie (titled Jumanji) has been made into a real game.
