Reggie Bush

Reginald Alfred "Reggie" Bush II (born March 2, 1985) is an American football player for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He plays the position of running back. 

Bush played football at Helix High School in La Mesa, California, then played football at the University of Southern California. Bush won the 2005 Heisman Trophy, which is for the best player in college football, but in 2010, he gave the award back because of claims that he took gifts while in college that would have made him a professional athlete while still in college.

The New Orleans Saints chose Bush with the second pick in the 2006 NFL Draft. In 2010, Bush won a Super Bowl with the Saints over the Indianapolis Colts.
