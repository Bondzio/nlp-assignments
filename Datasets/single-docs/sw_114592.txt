Bay Area Rapid Transit

The Bay Area Rapid Transit is a heavy rail public rapid transit system that serves the San Francisco Bay Area in northern California. Construction began in 1964 and the first trains began running in 1972. The system has a segment where it runs under the water in a subway under the San Francisco Bay. As of July 28, 2012, there are five lines.

People buy paper magnetic stripe cards inside the station. They insert this ticket into the gate, walk through the gate, and take the ticket out. After they have boarded and exited the train, they do the same thing to exit the station. Printed numbers on the card show how much money is left on the ticket. A passenger who enters and exits the same station will be charged an "excursion fare". As of July 28, 2012, that fare was $5.25.

In the 2000s, BART was expanded to reach San Francisco Airport. Projects are also going on to expand the line into Oakland Airport as well. Projects are also happening to expand the system past the Dublin/Pleasanton station and Pittsburg/Bay Point station. An extension to San Jose, California is expected to be completed by 2018.
