Kyoto Prefecture

In the Meiji period, Kyoto Prefecture was made from the area of the former Yamashiro Province.

From the 7th century through the late-19th century, the city of Kyoto was the Imperial capital of Japan.

Kyoto Prefecture is almost in the center of Honshū and of Japan. To the north, it faces the Sea of Japan and Fukui Prefecture. To the south, it faces Osaka and Nara Prefectures. To the east, it faces Mie and Shiga Prefectures. To the west, it faces Hyōgo Prefecture.

There are fifteen cities in Kyoto Prefecture.

These are the towns and villages in each district:

National Parks are established in about 6% of the total land area of the prefecture.

The Kamo Shrines ("Kamigamo jinja" and "Shimogamo jinja") are the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") in the prefecture.
