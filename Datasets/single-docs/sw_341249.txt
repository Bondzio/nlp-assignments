Fortune cookie

A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and oil with a short message or "fortune" inside. The cookie was made popular by Makoto Hagiwara who was a Japanese immigrant who ran the Japanese Tea Garden At San Franciscoâ€™s Golden Gate Park in the 1890s.

The "fortune" is a piece of paper with words of wisdom or prophecy. The message may also include a Chinese phrase with translation or a list of lucky numbers.
