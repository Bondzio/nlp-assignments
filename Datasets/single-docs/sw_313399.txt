Belgian Congo

Belgian Congo was a Belgian colony in central Africa. It was formed in 1908. The government of Belgium took over the previously separate kingdom of Belgium's monarch Léopold II; the Congo Free State. Today it is called the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It existed between Léopold II's formal transfer of his personal control to Belgium on 15 November 1908, and Congolese independence on 30 June 1960.
