Assassin bug

Assassin bugs are the Reduviidae. They are a large cosmopolitan family of "true bugs" or Hemiptera. 

They are almost all terrestrial ambush predators. Most members of the family are easy to recognise: they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build and formidable curved proboscis. Large specimens should be handled with care, if at all, because they may defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.
