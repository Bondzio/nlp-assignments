Economic liberalization

Economic liberalization is a theory about applying the ideas of classical liberalism to the government of a state: In very broad terms, it is about removing as much state control as possible from the economy. The state that follows this path often delegates some of the tasks it usually perfomed to privately held companies. Liberalization is also about offering interesting taxes to companies.
