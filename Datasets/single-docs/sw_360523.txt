1st Academy Awards

The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It was to honor the best movies of 1927 and 1928. It took place on May 16, 1929 in Los Angeles, California. AMPAS president Douglas Fairbanks hosted the show. 

Tickets cost five dollars, 270 people attended the event and the ceremony lasted fifteen minutes. Awards were made by Louis B. Mayer. It is the only Academy Awards ceremony not to be broadcast either on radio or television.

During the ceremony, the AMPAS gave Academy Awards (now commonly called Oscars) in twelve categories. Winners were announced three months before the live event. Some nominations were announced without reference to a specific movie. Examples were Ralph Hammeras and Nugent Slaughter, who received nominations in the now defunct category of Engineering Effects. Unlike later ceremonies, an actor or director could be awarded for multiple works in a year. Emil Jannings, for example, was given the Best Actor award for his work in both "The Way of All Flesh" and "The Last Command". Moreover, Charlie Chaplin and Warner Brothers each received an Honorary Award.
