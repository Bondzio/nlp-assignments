Srbosjek

Srbosjek (literally "Serb cutter" in Croatian, often referred to as "cutthroat") is the colloquial Croatian term for a type of knife used for killing prisoners in Croatian concentration camps in World War II.

The knife gained notoriety in the former Yugoslavian countries because it was used by the Croatian Ustaše during World War II for the killing of prisoners in the concentration camps of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, most notably the Jasenovac concentration camp. The victims were Serbs, Muslims, Jews, Croats and Roma, imprisoned on 'ethnic' grounds, imprisoned on the grounds that they were Yugoslav Partisans resistance members, or on the suspicion of taking part in anti-fascist activities.

The upper part of the knife was made of leather, as a sort of a glove, designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole, so that only the blade protruded from the hand. It was a curved, 12 cm long knife with the edge on its concave side. The knife was fastened to a bowed oval copper plate, while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle. The knife was fixed on the glove plate in order to prevent injuries and to prevent taking care of a separate knife in order to improve the work speed.

Such a type of wheat sheaf knife was manufactured prior to and during World War II by German factory Gebrüder Gräfrath from Solingen under the trademark "Gräwiso". 
Gebrüder Gräfrath was taken over in 1961 by Hubertus Solingen.

In the Jasenovac concentration camp competitions in speedy slaughter were organized by the Ustaše. The winner of one such competition, Petar Brzica slit the throats of 1,300 (or 1360 ) prisoners.
