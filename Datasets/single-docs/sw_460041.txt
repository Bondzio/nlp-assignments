A music video was made for each of these songs. Also, a promotional video was filmed for the song "Rain".

When the album was released, it got very good reviews. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic had this to say about the album "Ascendancy aligns real-deal thrash with powerful modern influences. But at all times it's a platform for Trivium's own crazed talent." It also got 7/10 stars from PopMatters.
