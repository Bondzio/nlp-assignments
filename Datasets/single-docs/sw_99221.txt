Seer Gharbi

Seer Gharbi is one of the 51 Union Councils of Abbottabad District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of the country of Pakistan. It is in the southeastern part of the province, bordering the Rawalpindi District of Punjab province.

Seer Gharbi means "Western Seer". This is because there are two towns called "Seer" and are very near to each other. The other Seer is known as "Seer Sharqi", which means "Eastern Seer".

On October 8, 2005, Seer Gharbi, like much of Abbottabad District, was affected by an earthquake. However the number of people killed or injured was low, the damage was largely to buildings and damage to water supplies.

The Union Council of Seer Gharbi is subdivided into three areas: Basbher, Malmola and Seer Gharbi.
