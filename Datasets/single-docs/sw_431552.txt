Wilko Johnson (born John Peter Wilkinson; 12 July 1947) is an English singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is best known for his time with the pub rock band Dr. Feelgood. He is said to be one of the founding influences of the English punk movement.

Johnson was featured in the first and second seasons of the HBO series "Game of Thrones". He played a mute executioner named Ilyn Payne.

In January 2013, he was diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer. He chose not to receive any chemotherapy. He said in an interview with John Wilson on the BBC Radio 4 programme "Front Row" that the doctors told him he only had nine or ten months to live. He also said during the interview that he was going to do a "farewell tour" of the UK set for March. When he finished his tour, he announced that he was going to spend his final days recording a farewell album with Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who.

In October 2014, Johnson announced he was cancer free.
