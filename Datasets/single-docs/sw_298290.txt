Wellington Monument, Dublin

The Wellington Monument is an obelisk in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland. It is also called "Wellington Testimonial" because it was built while Wellington was still alive.

The monument is in the southeast of the Park. It is near Kilmainham and the River Liffey. The obelisk is tall. It is the largest obelisk in Europe.

The monument was built to celebrate the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. He was born in Dublin.

It was designed by the architect Sir Robert Smirke. Building was started in 1817. In 1820 they ran out of money. It was not finished until 1861 when it was opened to the public. There were also plans for a statue of Wellesley on a horse in front of it. This was never built.

There are four bronze plaques on the bottom part of the monument. Three have pictures about Wellington's career, the fourth has text. The pictures are 'Civil and Religious Liberty' by John Hogan, 'Waterloo' by Thomas Farrell and the 'Indian Wars' by Joseph Robinson Kirk. The text reads:
