Safety lamp

A safety lamp is a miner's lamp with a covered flame that used to be used in coal mines.

The first safety lamp was invented by William Reid Clanny, which used bellows and water to separate gases. Later, two newer designs were invented: one was the Geordie lamp, made by George Stephenson, and the other was the Davy lamp, made by Sir Humphry Davy. In 1815, Davy discovered that if a flame was in a lamp, it would not ignite the flammable gases in mines. 

Coal mines are dangerous because of flammable gases like methane that can accumulate (gather together). A lamp with a naked (exposed) flame might ignite these flammable gases, causing an explosion, which might kill people. The safety lamp prevents the hot flame of the lamp touching the flammable gasses, reducing the chance of an explosion.
