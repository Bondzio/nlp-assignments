Outlook Express

Microsoft Outlook Express is an email program made by Microsoft. It is a free version of Outlook, also made by Microsoft. Microsoft's Outlook Express was discontinued in 2006 with the release of its new operating system, Windows Vista, which has Windows Mail instead.

Outlook Express needs a database to work, sometimes this database gets damaged when there are too many emails or when the database gets compacted. Compaction is needed when its size gets too large to handle well. Also, sometimes emails or attachments were infected with viruses.
