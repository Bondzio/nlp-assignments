Polymyalgia rheumatica

Polymyalgia rheumatica ("PMR", sometimes called just polymyalgia) is a disease that causes pain in the muscles. Most people with PMR have pain during the morning. Sometimes the pain is in the late afternoon or evening. About 15% of people having PMR may also have temporal arteritis.

PMR usually affects women. Men can have it also.

PMR usually happens in people age fifty and older. People under age 50 can be affected, although only rarely.

Recent research now seems to point to both polymyalgia and celiac disease having a common cause: an intolerance to gluten found in wheat, barley and rye. Celiac disease has been known since the 1940s, but recent research has shown that although the cause is the same, symptoms are different. Celiac disease causes painful gastrointestinal symptoms, but polymyalgia causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the shoulders, neck, upper arms, and hips.
