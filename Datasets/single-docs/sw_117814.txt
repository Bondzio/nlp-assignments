Suina

The suborder Suina (also known Suiformes) contains perhaps the earliest and most archaic even-toed ungulates.
This suborden Suina includes family Suidae (pigs, hogs) and the family Tayassuidae (peccaries). Older morphogical studies also identified family Hippopotamidae (hippos) among the Suina.
