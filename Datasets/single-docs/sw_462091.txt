Ala-ud-din Khalji

Ala-ud-din Khalji (died 1316) was the most powerful ruler of the Khalji Dynasty. He ruled from 1296 to 1316. He was the nephew (and son-in-law) of Jalal-ud-din Khalji. His son was Khusrau Malik. 

Ala-ud-din Khalji first conquered Gujarat and Malwa. In 1301 he conquered Ranthambore. In 1303 he captured Chittor. Then he sent a large army headed by his general Malik Kafur to South India. Malik Kafur defeated the Yadavas, Kakatiyas, Hoysalas and the Pandyas. He also took away a lot of wealth. Around the end of his reign, his empire was as large as that of Ashoka the Great (274 BCâ€“232 BC).

Khalji needed money to keep a large army. The main sources were taxes. The land tax was fixed according to the fertility of the land. The land tax in the fertile Ganga-Yamuna doab was one-half of the produce. He kept a strict check on the nobles. A group of officers were kept to discourage corruption. He introduced a system of auditing accounts.

He introduced a market control policy in which he reduced the price of day to day items such as sugar, oil, cloth etc. Shop owners had to pay the amount fixed by Ala-ud-din Khalji. Officials were appointed to check the shop owners. Whoever was caught cheating, was punished. This allowed Khalji to pay a low salary to the soldiers.

With money available to him he maintained a large army. He paid his soldiers in cash. He even started branding horses ( Dagh). This was to prevent the substitution of good horses with low quality horses. He even kept a description of all soldiers in his army (Chehra). He posted spies throughout the empire to prevent rebellions.
