Johnny Rebel (singer)

Clifford Joseph Trahan (born September 25, 1938 in Moss Bluff, Louisiana; died September 3, 2016 in Rayne, Louisiana), better known as Johnny Rebel or Pee Wee Trahan, is an American country music singer-songwriter who is known for writing and performing racist songs under the name, Johnny Rebel. His songs usually use the racial epithet nigger and sometimes he voices sympathy for Jim Crow-era segregation and the Ku Klux Klan. He went on hiatus for about three decades and then came back in 2001 after the September 11, 2001 attacks and issued his CD single "Infidel Anthem".
