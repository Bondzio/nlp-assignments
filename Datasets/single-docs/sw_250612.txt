Chūbu region

The regions of Japan are a fusion of historical divisions and modern administrative needs". The significance of the region in Japan is geographical, cultural and administrative.

In the late 7th century, the "Hokuridō" was identified as one of the eight largest administrative areas of the Imperial system ("ritsuryo seido").

"Gokishichidō" is an ancient system of names for parts of the country, including "Hokuridō". Chūbu covers a central part of the island of Honshū in roughly the same area as the traditional "Hokuriku", "Kōshin'etsu" and "Tōkai".

In the Meiji period, the modern regional system was made by Imperial decree. Japan was divided into regions ("chihō"), including the Hokuriku and Tokai or Chūbu region. A regional council ("chihō gyōsei kyōgisai") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping. The council also included regional chiefs of central government ministries.

Over time, Chūbu has developed its own regional dialects, customs and unique traditional culture.

The Chūbu region is a large area of Honshū. Chūbu has traditional subddivisions, including Hokuriku, Kōshin'etsu, Shin'etsu, and Tōkai.
