Pantera

Pantera was a band from Arlington, Texas, in the USA. They formed in 1981, but they did not have success until the 1990 release of their fifth studio album "Cowboys from Hell". From 1987 to 2003 the band had these members: Phil Anselmo (vocals), "Dimebag Darrell" Abbott (guitar), Vinnie Paul Abbott (drums), Rex Brown (bass). In 2003, the band broke up, and in the following year, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed by a fan during a concert of his new band Damageplan in Columbus, Ohio.
