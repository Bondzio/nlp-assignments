Banjo Paterson

Andrew Barton "Banjo" Paterson (1864 â€“ 1941) was a famous Australian bush poet, journalist and author. He wrote many ballads and poems about Australian life. He wrote about life in the country and outback areas of Australia. Much of his work was about the area around Binalong, New South Wales where he spent much of his childhood. Paterson's famous poems include "Waltzing Matilda", "The Man from Snowy River" and "Clancy of the Overflow". Three movies have been made about The Man from Snowy River: The Man from Snowy River (1982), Return to Snowy River (1988), and The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular (2003).
Banjo Paterson has inspired many Australians and continues to do so.
