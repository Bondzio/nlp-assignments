Sněžka

Sněžka (, ) is the highest mountain in the Czech Republic. Its top is above sea level. The mountain is in the Giant Mountains ("Krkonoše"), in the nordeastern part of Bohemia. It is about 150 kilometres from Prague, the country's capital. Buses from Prague go to the town of Pec pod Sněžkou, from there the tourists must walk, because the cable-way is now closed.

There is the Czech-Polish border on the top of Sněžka. Both Czechs and Poles have their buildings on the top. The wooden chappel of St Lawrence and a new post office are in Bohemia; a big modern hotel is in Silesia (Poland). The whole area is a protected natural area. There are no trees on Sněžka because it is too high for them. Instead, there are rocks that can be dangerous to the walkers. They are recommended to wear good shoes and avoid the mountain in winter or if it is raining.
