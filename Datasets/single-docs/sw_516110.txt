150 North Riverside Chicago

150 North Riverside Plaza is building currently under construction. The building is planned to be 54 stories tall when completed. The building will occupy a two-acre site on the west bank of the Chicago River. The building will feature 1.2 million square feet of leasable office space, but due to its unique superstructure design, will only encompass 25 percent of the lot.
