Teak

Teak is the common name for the tropical hardwood tree species TectonaÂ grandis and its wood products. "Tectona grandis" is native to south and southeast Asia, mainly India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Burma, but grows in many countries, including those in Africa and the Caribbean. Burma produces nearly one third of the world's total teak.

The word teak comes from the Malayalam (in the Malabar Coast region) word "theka" or "tekka". This tree is mentioned in the seventh-century literature of Tamil popularly known as the Tevaram.

"Tectona grandis" is a large, deciduous tree that is dominant in mixed hardwood forests. It has small, fragrant white flowers and papery leaves that are often hairy on the lower surface.
