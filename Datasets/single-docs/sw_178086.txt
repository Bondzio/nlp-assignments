Following this, he went to Ludgrove School, and, after passing the entrance exams, he went to Eton College, where he learnt geography, biology, and art history at A-Level. At Eton, he took part in many sports including Football, basket ball, and water polo. He then took a year away from education (a 'gap year') before going to the University of St.Andrews. He graduated in 2004, with a degree in geography.

William graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006; the graduation parade was attended by the Queen and the Prince of Wales, along with other members of the Royal Family, and William officially received his commission as a lieutenant. With his rank obtained, the Prince, using the name of William Wales, followed his younger brother into the Blues and Royals as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit, after which he spent four months in training for the post at Bovington Camp, Dorset.
