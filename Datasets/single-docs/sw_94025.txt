Guitar Hero: On Tour

Guitar Hero: On Tour is a music video game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by RedOctane and Activision. It's the first "Guitar Hero" game made for a handheld game system. To play, players use Slot 2 (the bottom loading slot of the DS) to attach a device with red, green, blue, and yellow buttons on it. The player uses those four keys to play the game.

The gameplay of "Guitar Hero: On Tour" is like the other "Guitar Hero" games where the player strums and hits the fret buttons when the notes appear on the screen.

"Guitar Hero: On Tour" has two track lists. One's for North America, the UK, and Australia, and the other's for non-English speaking countries in Europe. Both have five songs that the other does not have. They both have 26 songs including one bonus track.

"Guitar Hero: On Tour" got mostly good reviews with 81% at Game Rankings and 76/100 at Meta Critic. It was praised for being a challenging and fun game. Some reviewers complained about hand cramps from playing.

"On Tour" was the second best-selling games of June 2008, having sold 422,000 copies. It's Activision's fastest-selling DS game.
