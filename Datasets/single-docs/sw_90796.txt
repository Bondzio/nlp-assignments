Speed of sound

The speed of sound is per hour or per second in dry air in room temperature. Sound moves faster through liquids and solids than air, since liquids and solids can be pushed together more. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum, which is a space without any air or matter. The speed of sound is affected by temperature. It travels slower at low temperatures, for example in the stratosphere.

You can calculate the speed of sound like this:

formula_1

Where:
formula_2 is the ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air)
R is the gas constant (formula_3 for air)
T is temperature (in Kelvins)

The speed of sound is also known as Mach 1. Things that go faster are supersonic.
