Common year starting on Friday

This is the calendar for any common year starting on Friday, January 1 (dominical letter C). The most recent year of this type was 2010 and the next one will be 2021 in the Gregorian calendar,
or 2011 and 2022 in the Julian calendar. The exceptional common year, 2100 will also be a common year starting on Friday in the Gregorian calendar (see bottom tables).

A common year is a year with 365 days, i.e., not a leap year.

This is the only year type where the "n"th "Doomsday" (this year Sunday) is not in ISO week "n"; it is in ISO week "n"-1.
