Nitrate

Nitrate (NO) is a polyatomic ion. It is made up of one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms. It is part of many important molecules. Potassium nitrate is a common nitrate, used in fertilizers because plants need both potassium and nitrates to live and grow. Sodium nitrate is also used for fertilizer and other purposes. 

Some nitrates are explosive. People make large amounts of nitrates from ammonia. Nitrates are similar to nitrites. Many metal nitrates with thermal decomposition makes oxygen and metal nitrate.

Nitric acid has the formula HNO and has no overall charge, because the hydrogen ion is positive.
