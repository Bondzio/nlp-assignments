National Archives of Japan

The , also known by the acronym NAJ, is a Japanese public institution which preserves government documents and historical records.

The National Archives Law No. 79 (1999) established NAJ's core function of preserving government documents and records. 
Before the creation of the National Archives, there is almost no tradition of preserving "grey-area" records, such as records which show the process which led to the formation of a specific policy.

The National Archives became an Independent Administrative Institution on April 1, 2001.

Since 2005, the NAJ website has offered high-resolution images of some of its holdings, including those named as Important Cultural Properties of Japan.
