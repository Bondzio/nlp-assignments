New England town

Towns in New England are called New England towns. They have a basic local government in each of the six New England states. New England towns are similar to civil townships. New England towns are often governed by town meetings. There is little to no county government. Connecticut and Rhode Island counties have no government authority. Massachusetts has removed eight of fourteen county governments so far.
