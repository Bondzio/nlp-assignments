Example

918785
77 is divisible by 7, so the original number 918785 is also divisible by 7.

Proof:
Pretend formula_1 is the root number and formula_2 is the last digit. Then formula_3 is the whole number.
If the whole number (formula_3) is divisible by 7, formula_5 is also a multiple of 7. And formula_6 also divide 7. That proves formula_7 is divisible seven, since 3 and 6 are both multiples of 3. So formula_8 is also divisible by 7.
