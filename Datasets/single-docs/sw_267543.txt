Pete Carroll

Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951, in San Francisco, California) is the head coach and of the Seattle Seahawks, a National Football League team. He used to coach for the New York Jets, New England Patriots and the University of Southern California football team.

In his time at USC, the Trojans went to two BCS Bowl games, winning the National Championship in 2004 and winning the Pacific-10 Conference football title seven years in a row from 2002 to 2008. The 2004 BCS title was taken away from the team in 2010, but USC kept its 2003 and 2004 AP National Championships.

Carroll went to Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. Carroll played in three sports: football (playing quarterback, wide receiver and defensive back), basketball and baseball. Carroll won the school's Athlete of the Year award in 1969.

After high school, Carroll went to junior college (a two-year college) at College of Marin, where he played football for two years before changing schools to the University of the Pacific. At Pacific, Carroll played the free safety position for two years.

After graduation, Carroll tried out for the Honolulu Hawaiians of the World Football League, but did not make the team because of shoulder problems. To make money, he found a job selling roofing materials in the Bay Area, but he found he was not good at it and soon moved on; it would be his only non-football-related job.
