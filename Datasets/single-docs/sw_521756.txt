Individual retirement account

An individual retirement account or IRA is a form of "individual retirement plan". It is simply a savings account with large tax advantages. An IRA is not itself an investment. It is where an investor keeps assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. A 401(k) is set up by an employer. But an IRA may be started by an individual. Other IRAs may be opened by small business owners and those who are self-employed.

There are different types of IRAs: Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs. They vary as to tax filing status. Also they have different rules and s. 

A participant-directed account (also called a self-directed IRA) is an IRA which is provided by some financial institutions in the United States. It allows alternative investments for retirement savings. Some examples of such alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property. There is a risk of fraud when investing in Self-Directed retirement accounts.
