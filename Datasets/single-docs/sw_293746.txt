List of capital cities by altitude

This is a list of national capitals ranked by altitude. The altitude of the cities affects the people and buildings of the place. In many cases, the cold climate in winter means a particular style of house with heating and a different lifestyle is needed to fit to the weather.

The first country in this list, Bolivia, is a country with many capitals - Sucre (constitutional capital) and La Paz (seat of government). If we consider La Paz as the national capital, then Bolivia will be ranked as number 1 in the List, but if you consider Sucre, then the capital of Ecuador - Quito - will be the highest national capital.
