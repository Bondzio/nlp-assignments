Heathers

Heathers is a 1989 American black comedy teen movie starring Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, and Shannen Doherty. The movie is about a group of four girls in a high school in Sherwood, Ohio. The girls, three of whom are named Heather, rule the school as they are the prettiest and most popular girls in town. 

"Heathers" won awards for its director Michael Lehmann and producer Denise Di Novi the 1990 Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Daniel Waters also won an award for his screenplay, which won a 1990 Edgar Award. The movie was a U.S. box office failure, but has since become a cult classic, as is shown by its high sales and rentals on DVD and VHS. In 2006, it was ranked #5 on "Entertainment Weekly's" list of the "50 Best High School Movies".
