Servants' hall

The servants' hall is traditionally a common room for domestic workers in a great house. The term usually refers to the domestic workers' dining room.

If there is no separate sitting room, the Servants' Hall doubles as the place servants may spend their leisure hours and serves as both sitting room and dining room.
