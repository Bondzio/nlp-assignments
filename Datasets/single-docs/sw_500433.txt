Nintendomagasinet

Nintendomagasinet (NM) was a Swedish video game magazine. It was published between the years of 1990 and 1994. The magazine contained news, reports and comics based on video games. It also had a subscriber-only "Power Player" supplement which consisted of game reviews. The comics were translations of the Nintendo Comics System comics. Later it changed to the Nintendo Power comics "Super Mario Adventures" and "The Legend of Zelda".

The first issue can be seen in the Swedish 1992 film "JÃ¶nssonligan & den svarta diamanten".
