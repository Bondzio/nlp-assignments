Islam in Niger

More than 90% of the people in Niger (or 9 out of every 10 people) are Muslims. Most of the rest of Niger's people are Animists.

However, these numbers are not exact. In Niger, many of the people who practice traditional religions have mixed some beliefs from Islam into their religions. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly how many people practice each religion.

Islam in Niger began to spread around a thousand years ago. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Islam became more common than Niger's traditional religions. Since then, Sufi brotherhoods have become the most common and powerful Muslim organisations, like in many West African countries. Because of this, there are many different interpretations (or ways of understanding and practicing) Islam in Niger. These different interpretations exist alongside each other, and alongside less common religions, usually peacefully.

The government of Niger is secular, or separate from any religion. At the same time, the government recognizes that Islam is the most popular religion in the country.
