Caucasian race

Caucasian race is a term used for a person belonging to a racial group that includes people from Europe, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Western Asia (the Middle East), parts of Central Asia and South Asia. German anthropologists in the late 18th century applied this name because they thought people from the Caucasus Mountains were the best examples of the race.
