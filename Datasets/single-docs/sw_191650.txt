Juniper berry

The juniper berry is the female seed cone made by the different kinds of junipers. It is not a true berry, but its unusual roundness and merged scales make it look like a berry. Some of the cones are used as spices. Juniper berries are also used to flavour gin. According to a FAO document, juniper berries are the only spice that comes from conifers. However, tar and bark from pine trees are sometimes thought of as spices, too.
