Golf course

A golf course is where the game of golf is usually played. It is made up of a series of 'holes', each consisting of certain key areas. A teeing ground us used to start playing the hole. A Fairway is the area between the tee and the green, where the grass is kept short for ball play. The green (or putting green is a closely mowed area of grass surrounding the hole. It has a flagstick so the golfer can see the hole at longer distances. The hole itself has a diameter of 4Â¼ inches (108mm). Other areas of a golf course are called hazards. These include sand hazards and water hazards. Hazards are designed to make the game more challenging.

A standard round of golf consists of playing eighteen holes. Many golf courses are designed with eighteen holes. Some, however, only have nine holes, and the course is played twice per round.
