Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)

Memorial Stadium was a stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The stadium was home to the National Football League (NFL) team, the Baltimore Ravens from 1996 to 1997 and was also home to the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball from 1954 to 1991, as well as the Baltimore Colts from 1954 to 1983, and the Baltimore Stallions from 1986 to 1987. The stadium was demolished in 2001. In 2010 a new baseball field was built on the same site of the Memorial stadium and Cal Ripken was at the ribbon-cutting. It was nicknamed "The Old Grey Lady of 33rd Street" and "The World's Largest Outdoor Insane Asylum", for the infamous fan noise. The stadium eventually lost teams because it could not compete with other newer stadiums. There was a plack on the stadium honoring allied soldiers in World War II. A replica now sits outside Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the new home of the Orioles. The Ravens now play in M&T Bank Stadium.
