Tigger

Tigger is a fictional tiger. He has orange fur with black stripes. He was first written about in A. A. Milne's book "The House at Pooh Corner." He is easily recognized by his beady eyes, long chin, springy tail, and bouncy personality. As he says himself, "Bouncing is what Tiggers do best." Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed animals.
