Hydrazone

A hydrazone is the functional group with structure RRC=NNH. They are like aldehydes or ketones, with an NNH group instead of the oxygen atom.

They are made by reacting hydrazines with ketones or aldehydes:

Hydrazones are very useful molecules to do some reactions. For example, a ketone can be reduced down completely if made into a hydrazine and then treated with sodium ethoxide (Wolffâ€“Kishner reduction). Hydrazones are very important intermediates in many reactions, such as the Fischer indole synthesis. This makes indoles, groups which are found in many drugs.
