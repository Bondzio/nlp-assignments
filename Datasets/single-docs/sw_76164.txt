Shell (projectile)

A shell is a type of projectile used in weapons. It is filled with explosive or other substances. It is similar to a bomb but is made to be shot out of a gun. Shells are usually large caliber projectiles fired by artillery, armored fighting vehicles (including tanks), and warships.

Shells usually have the shape of a cylinder but taper towards the front end to form a point. However, special shells may use other shapes.
