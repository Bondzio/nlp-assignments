Robben Island

Robben Island is an island near Cape Town in South Africa. It was a high-security prison where Nelson Mandela was held captive for 18 years. He and the other political prisoners were forced to work at the limestone quarries on the island. They were not allowed to talk or do anything but work.

Robben Island is both a South African National Heritage Site as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
