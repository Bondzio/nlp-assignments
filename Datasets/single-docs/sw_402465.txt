Teacup

A teacup is a porcelain cup that is used to hold liquid for drinking. It is usually used for drinking tea. It is also used for drinking coffee or some other hot drink. A teacup has a handle on the side that stays cool when the rest of the cup is too hot to hold. It also has its own small plate to sit on, called a "saucer".

Teacups are often decorated with patterns or pictures. Those painted by hand can be expensive. A few people collect such cups, and do not use them.
