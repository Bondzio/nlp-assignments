But I'm a Cheerleader

But I'm a Cheerleader is a 1999 American LGBT-based romantic teen comedy-drama movie. The movie stars Natasha Lyonne as a high school cheerleader who thinks she's straight, but then comes to discover that she's really a lesbian. The MPAA initially gave the movie an NC-17 rating. However, the movie was edited to get the much more marketable R rating. In 2006, the director of this movie criticized the MPAA for being prejudiced toward movies containing gay or lesbian material. But I'm a Cheerleader received mostly substandard reviews from critics who did not like the movie.
