Kittur Chennamma

Kitturu Rani Chennamma (; born 23 October 1778 in Kittur, Karnataka – died 21 February 1829) was the Queen of the princely state of Kittur, in what is now India. She was best known for leading an armed rebellion against the British East India Company in 1824. This was 33 years before the 1857 war of independence. The British were going to take control of Kittur under the doctrine of lapse, because there was no male heir. The resistance ended with her martyrdom and she is remembered today as one of the earliest Indian rulers to have fought for independence. Along with Abbakka Rani, Keladi Chennamma and Onake Obavva she is much venerated in Karnataka as an icon of bravery and women’s pride.
