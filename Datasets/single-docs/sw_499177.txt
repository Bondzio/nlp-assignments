House of Noailles

The House or family of Noailles was a French noble family. Their name comes from the castle of Noailles in Ayen. The first member of this family to become famous was Antoine Noailles (1504 – 1562). He was Admiral of France and ambassador to England. His son Henri was made Count of Ayen by Henry IV of France. The grandson of Henri, Anne (died 1768) played an important role during the early reign of Louis XIV. He became Captain general of Roussillon. He then became Duke of Ayen.

Members of the family held several titles. One of these titles, Duke of Noailles was created in 1663. Other younger males were often given the title of Count of Ayen. This was a countship in the area of France where they came from (Auvergne). Following 1711, members of the family had the right to use the additional title Grandee of Spain. The title of "Prince of Poix" was usually used by the heir to the Mouchy dukedom. Heirs to the Noailles dukedom were given the courtesy title of Duke of Ayen. The family produced four cardinals. Several were Marshals of France. A cadet branch (younger branch) of the Duke of Mouchy were also descended from the family.


Members of this family owned a large townhouse in Paris called the "Hôtel de Noailles". This is where the future Madame de La Fayette was born. She married her husband Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette in the chapel of the Hôtel de Noailles on April 11, 1774. The couple lived there for the first few years of their marriage.
