Liberian Girl

"Liberian Girl" is a song by Michael Jackson. It was the ninth single from "Bad". It was only released in Europe and Australia. It starts with the South African female singer Letta Mbulu saying "Nakupenda pia- nakutaka pia-mpenziwex", Swahili for "Love you too. I want you too, my love." Swahili is not actually spoken in Liberia. It reached number 1 in Ireland. The music video has lots of Jackson's celebrity friends in it. In 2009 the song came back into the charts in the UK, France, and Switzerland after Michael Jackson died.
