Sweden at the Olympics

Sweden was first at the Olympic Games at the inaugural 1896 Games. They have been in every Games since then with one exception for the 1904 Summer Olympics. Sweden has earned medals at all Olympic games except for two, the 1896 Games and the 1904 Games. 

Sweden hosted the Games on one occasion, the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. The equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne were held in Stockholm, due to quarantine reasons.

Swedish athletes have a total of 475 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 118 at the Winter Olympic Games.

The International Olympic Committee had Swedish officer and sports instructor Viktor Balck as one of its original members. The Swedish Olympic Committee was formed and recognized in 1913.

2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 Winter Games bids were declared non-finished applications by the Swedish Olympic Committee, due lack of political support from the Swedish government. The reason has been that the bidding is financially insecure for the Swedish society as a nation. 2018 Winter Olympic Games bids were promised support by the former government, but when the new government was elected, the bid was withdrawn. Östersund and Åre were the only applicant cities.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Total medal counts include six medals – three gold, two silver, and one bronze – awarded in the 1908 and 1920 figure skating events. These medals are included in the summer games medal totals and the winter sport medal totals. This is why the totals for summer and winter games do not match the totals for summer and winter sports.
