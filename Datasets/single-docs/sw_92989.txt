Müritz Rural District

Müritz is a former district in the southern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. It is named after the lake Müritz. Lake Müritz is the largest Lake in Germany. Lake Constance is larger, but part of it is in Switzerland and another part in Austria.

The district was created on June 12, 1994 by joining the old districts of Röbel and Waren, and a few municipalities from the districts Malchin and Neustrelitz.
