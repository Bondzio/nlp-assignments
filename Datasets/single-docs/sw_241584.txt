Satyagraha

Satyagraha ( "satyƒÅgraha") is the idea of nonviolent resistance (fighting with peace) started by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (also known as "Mahatma" Gandhi). Gandhi used "satyagraha" in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggle in South Africa. "Satyagraha" helped shape Nelson Mandela's struggle in South Africa under apartheid, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s campaigns during the civil rights movement in the United States, and many other similar movements. Someone who does "satyagraha" is a satyagrahi.

The word "Satyagraha" is from the Sanskrit words "satya" (meaning "truth") and "Agraha" ("insistence", or "holding firmly to"). For Gandhi, "Satyagraha" went far beyond just "passive resistance" (resisting without taking action). His non-violence also became his strength. He said that he chose the name because Truth means Love, and Insistence means Force, and the Sanskrit name showed it was a force born from Truth and Love (non-violence).

He also wrote that he liked the term "Civil Resistance" better than "Civil disobedience". Gandhi also translated it as "love force" or "soul force".

In most conflict, the goal is to defeat the enemy, to stop him from meeting his goal, or to meet a goal that the enemy is trying to stop. But in "Satyagraha", these are not the goals. The goal, Gandhi said, is to change the mind of the wrong-doer, not to force him. Winning means getting along with the enemy to make what is wrong right again, which they might not realize is wrong. For this to happen, the enemy's mind must change to realize that he is stopping a goal that is right.

Gandhi asked those who did satyagraha (called "satyagrahis") to follow these rules:


Another time, Gandhi gave seven important rules: A satyagrahi:
