Monosodium glutamate

Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), also known as sodium glutamate) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. It is a chemical used to make foods taste better. This works because savory flavors are enhanced. That means the savory flavors are stronger. MSG is found in most foods. It is in higher concentrations in high protein foods such as meat, fish and dairy products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classed MSG as a food additive that is "generally recognized as safe". However, the FDA requires that it be listed on the label.
