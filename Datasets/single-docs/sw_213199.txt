Manuel Neuer

Manuel Neuer (born 27 March 1986 in Gelsenkirchen) is a German footballer. He is the goalkeeper for FC Bayern Munich.

Neuer has played for the youth teams of Schalke 04 since he was five years old. On 19 August 2006 he played his first match in the Bundesliga. Because he was very good, he replaced Frank Rost as Schalke's number one. Rost left Schalke in 2007 and plays now for Red Bull New York.

On 1 June 2011 Schalke and Bayern Munich announced that Neuer would move to Bayern Munich in July 2011. There he signed a five-year contract that will last until June 2016. The transfer was worth â‚¬18 million, therefore making him the third most expensive goalkeeper of all time. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup Neuer made some world class saves and only conceded a few goals during the tournament, but in the European qualifiers he conceded 2 major goals in a 2-0 loss to Poland. 

Neuer has also played for all youth teams of the Germany national football team from the Under-18 team on. On 2 June 2009, he played for the first time in the senior team (against the United Arab Emirates). Neuer was selected as Germany's number one for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

He was also the goalkeeper of the German Under-21 team when they won the UEFA Under-21 European Championship in June 2009.
