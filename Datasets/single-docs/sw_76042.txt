City status in the United Kingdom

City status in the United Kingdom is granted by the British monarch to some communities.

Becoming a city is not automatic, but many people think that any town that has a cathedral is a city. This is because Henry VIII built cathedrals in six English towns and also granted made them cities by letters patent.

A city council does not have any more powers than a borough or district council. Some city councils (like Ripon) are only parish councils, so have very little powers at all.

Officially there are 66 cities in the United Kingdom (UK). Sunderland was made a city to mark Elizabeth II's Ruby anniversary (40 years as Queen). Eight others have been created in competitions to celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee.

A city does not automatically have a Lord Mayor or Lord Provost in Scotland. There are 66 cities in the UK but only 30 Lord Mayors.

Of the 66 cities: (including 30 Lord Mayoralties or Lord Provostships) in the UK:

Rochester was a city from 1211 to 1998.

On April 1 1974 the city council was abolished, and new letters patent were issued to the new Medway Borough Council to carry on the city name in the old city area.

In 1979 Medway was renamed Rochester-upon-Medway and new letters patent made the whole of the new area a city.

On April 1, 1998, Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham joined together to became the new unitary authority of Medway. Rochester upon Medway City Council did not appoint appoint Charter Trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty so the city simply ceased to exist, because the council forgot.
