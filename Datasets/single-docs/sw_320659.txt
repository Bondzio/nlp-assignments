Beat (music)

A beat is the basic unit of music . Beats can help measure tempos and are performed in grooves and rhythmic music. They measure the pulse and rhythm of a musical piece. They are usually divided into two kinds: stressed and unstressed beats. Stressed beats are the 'strong' beats and unstressed are the 'weak' beats. Time signatures and tempos are created by moving the beats into particular orders.
