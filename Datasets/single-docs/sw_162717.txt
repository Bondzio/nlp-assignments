Hurricane Nate (2005)

Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It came close to Bermuda, but it stayed at sea. Nate was the 14th named storm and 7th hurricane of the 2005 season. It formed to the southwest of Bermuda on September 5. It then moved very slowly to the northeast, and it passed to the south of Bermuda. The storm then moved into colder waters, and it began to weaken. Nate was later absorbed by a larger weather system.

The storm caused no damage because it stayed at sea. However, one person was killed from rip currents that were caused by the storm. Nate caused light rainfall and gusty winds on Bermuda. Canadian Navy ships that were carrying supplies to help people in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were slowed down because of Nate.
