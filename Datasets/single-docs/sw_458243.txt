ProtonMail

ProtonMail is an email service founded in 2013. ProtonMail can encrypt users' emails, making them impossible to read to anyone without an encryption password. ProtonMail exists partly in response to news about surveillance done by the National Security Agency.
ProtonMail is run in Switzerland, where the United States does not have legal jurisdiction. They have run a successful campaign to raise money from donations.
