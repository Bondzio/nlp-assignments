John the Apostle

Saint John was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus. He is believed to have written the one of the four gospels of the New Testament of the Christian Bible that is named after him. He also wrote the New Testament books of First 2nd and 3rd John and the Book of Revelation. Tradition holds he was the last surviving apostle, and the only apostle to die a natural death rather than by martyrdom. John is the brother of James according to the Bible. He is remembered in many churches on December 27.
