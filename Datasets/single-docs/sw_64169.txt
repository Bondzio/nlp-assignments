Redox

Redox (shorthand for reduction/oxidation) describes all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation number (oxidation state) changed.

The term "redox" comes from the two concepts of reduction and oxidation. It can be explained in simple terms:

Which gains and loses electrons can be easily memorised by the abbreviation OIL RIG, which stands for, "Oxidation Is Loss," or losing electrons, and "Reduction Is Gain," or gaining electrons.

But there are exceptions.

Redox is a chemical process. It can be described within chemical formulas. This example describes the process that occurs in a blast furnace, where iron (Fe) reacts with carbon (C):
