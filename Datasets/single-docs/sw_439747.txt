Adelobasileus

Adelobasileus is an extinct proto-mammal from the Upper Triassic, about 225 million years ago. We only have a partial skull from strata in western Texas.

Skull features, such as the housing of the cochlea, suggest that "Adelobasileus" is a transitional form in the evolution from cynodonts to end-Triassic mammals. For this reason, it may be close to the common ancestor of modern mammals.
