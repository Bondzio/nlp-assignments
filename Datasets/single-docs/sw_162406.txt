Regional Railways

Regional Railways was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail. It was created in 1982. It finished operation in 1996, two years after privatisation. The sector was originally called Provincial.

Before privatisation, the Regional Railways sector was split into several different franchises ready for privatisation.
