New York Provincial Congress

The New York Provincial Congress was an organization that was started by rebels in 1775 during the American Revolution as a replacement for the Province of New York Assembly, and as a replacement for the Committee of One Hundred. There were three provincial congresses until the first Constitutional Convention was founded. The New York Provincial Congress was replaced in 1777.
