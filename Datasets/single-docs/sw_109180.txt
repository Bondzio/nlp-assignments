Octane

Octane is an alkane (a hydrocarbon). It is commonly used in fuel. It is the most important part of gasoline, because it is the part which produces most of the energy that comes from gasoline when it is burned. A "high octane" fuel will be more productive than a "low octane" fuel. The IUPAC Name for Octane is "2,2,4-Trimethylpentane".
