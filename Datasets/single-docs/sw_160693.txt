Gatwick Express

Gatwick Express is the name of a train that runs between Victoria station in London and Gatwick Airport in South East England. It is fast because it does not stop at other stations. The train comes every 30Â minutes.

Before June 2008, Gatwick Express was a train operating company (TOC) and was a franchise owned by Southern, another TOC that has trains on other routes. On 22 June 2008, the Gatwick Express TOC was closed. Now the Gatwick Express is directly operated by Southern, but it is still called Gatwick Express.
