Sanuki Province

The province had borders with Awa and Iyo Provinces. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Sanuki Province were reformed in the 1870s.

Sanuki faced the Seto Inland Sea.

"Tamura jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Sanuki.
