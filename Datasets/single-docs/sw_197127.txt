Flat Earth Society

The Flat Earth Society (or the International Flat Earth Research Society) is an organisation saying that the Earth is flat (most of us think it's round; a sphere). It was started by Samuel Shenton in 1956, and then it was led by Charles K. Johnson, who made his home the organisation's base. It seems that the Flat Earth Society "disbanded" (stopped existing) after Johnsonâ€™s death in 2001, but some websites still use the organisation's name.
Many people say that NASA proved that the Earth is not flat by taking pictures of the planet from space. The Society says they are fake, and that NASA is a part of a conspiracy.
