Radar is a machine that uses radio waves for echolocation to find objects such as aircraft, ships, and rain. 

The basic parts of a radar are:

By doing this, the radar can locate the object. Radar is used in many different ways. It can measure the speed and number of cars on a road, the amount of water in the air, and many other things.
