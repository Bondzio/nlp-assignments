Discordianism

Discordianism is a postmodern religion in which disorder is as important as order, existing within chaos. It was founded circa 1958â€“1959 by Malaclypse the Younger, who published its most important text: the "Principia Discordia".

The Sacred Chao and Five fingered hand of ERIS are the most recognized symbols of Discordianism.
