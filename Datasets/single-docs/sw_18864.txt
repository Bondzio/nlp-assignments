Marcha Real

La Marcha Real (English translation: "The Royal March") is the national anthem (country's song) of Spain. It is one of the few national anthems in the world (our planet Earth) to have only music, and no words.


Let's sing together,

with different voices,

and only one heart.

Long live Spain!

from the green valleys,

to the vast sea,

a hymn of brotherhood.

Love the Motherland,

which embrace

the free peoples

below its blue sky.

Glory to the sons,

who have given to history,

justice and greatness!
