ActiveX

ActiveX is a control in the "DLL" (Dynamic-link library) that can be used as a share data over the applications. ActiveX is a type of library in the file DLL. 

Any of the Microsoft Windows data files having the same file format as that of the Dynamic-link library can be called a resource DLL. Examples of such DLLs include icon libraries, sometimes having the extension ICL, and the font files, having the extensions FON and FOT.
