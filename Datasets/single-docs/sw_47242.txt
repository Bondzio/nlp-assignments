English Wikipedia

The English Wikipedia is the English language edition of the Wikipedia encyclopedia. English was the first language that Wikipedia was in. It was started on 15 January 2001. It is the largest version of Wikipedia, with 5,193,000+ articles as of July 2016. Wikipedias in other languages have imitated some of its technical and organizational features. It has a newsletter called The Signpost, which was started by Michael Snow. There is also an Old English Wikipedia.

As the English Wikipedia is very popular, there can be many people editing the wiki in one minute. This made the almost useless for understanding changes. Instead, editors can select and watch for changes in particular articles, using the "watchlist" feature of MediaWiki. Some also use special software to detect and fix vandalism.

Some people think that the English Language Wikipedia shows bias and unfairness. Editors of reference works such as the "Encyclop√¶dia Britannica" have questioned Wikipedia's utility and status as an encyclopedia. An example of bias is that around 90% of Wikipedia editors are male. Other people think that Wikipedia is more useful than other encyclopedias because it is large and can be updated quickly.
In 2012 the logo of the English Wikipedia was slightly changed. However, some Wikipedias, like the Simple English Wikipedia, still kept the old logo, which is bigger than the new version.

On 18 January 2012, the English Wikipedia shut down for one day in order to protest against SOPA, a law proposed in Congress. SOPA would have stopped Wikipedia from operating online, and would have made it close. Wikipedia began working again the day after.
