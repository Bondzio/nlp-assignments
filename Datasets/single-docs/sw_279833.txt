Gorgosaurus

Gorgosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in western North America during the Upper Cretaceous, between about 76.5 and 75 million years ago. 

Fossil remains have been found in the Canadian province of Alberta and possibly the U.S. state of Montana. It was closely related to "T. rex" and "Albertosaurus". Gorgosaurus, like "T. rex", had huge jaws with large, sharp, cone-shaped teeth, powerful legs, tiny arms and two-fingered hands.
