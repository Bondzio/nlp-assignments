Sweet Female Attitude

Sweet Female Attitude was a UK garage and R&B girl group, consisting of Leanne Brown and Catherine Cassidy, who are considered a one-hit wonder in the United Kingdom. The group's debut single "Flowers" was an instant hit and reached number two on the UK charts. Their follow up single "8 Days a Week" didn't reach the same success as "Flowers" and missed the top 40 and peaked at 43 on the charts. Their album ""In Person"" was only released in Germany.
