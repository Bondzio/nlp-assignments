Napoleonic Code

The Napoleonic Code ‒ or Code Napoléon ‒ is the French civil code established under Napoléon I in 1804. The code did not allow privileges based on birth (such as nobility). It allowed freedom of religion. It also set up a system of Civil service where government jobs would go to the most qualified. 

Due to the Napoleonic Wars the Napoleonic code became an influence on most of Europe. In particular, it influenced countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, Latin American countries, the province of Quebec and the state of Louisiana in the United States. It influenced all other former French colonies which base their civil law systems on the Napoleonic Code.
