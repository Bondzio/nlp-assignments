Odawara, Kanagawa

It has been recognized as a special city since 2000.

In the Edo period, "Odawara-juku" was 9th of the 53 shogunate-maintained waystations ("shuku-eki") along the Tōkaidō road which connected Edo and Kyoto. 

During the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923, most Odawara buildings collapsed immediately; and fires burned anything left standing.

The borders of Odawara are the Hakone Mountains to the north and west, the Sakawa River to the east and Sagami Bay to the south.
