Malakand Division

Malakand Division () was an administrative division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, until the reforms of 2000 abolished the third tier of government.

In 1969, the princely states of Chitral, Dir and Swat were incorporated into West Pakistan as the new division of Malakand with Saidu as its capital.
