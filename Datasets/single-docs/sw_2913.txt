Homonym

A homonym is a word that has more than one meaning. For example, "right" means moral, the opposite of left, and a personal freedom.

Definition: one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings.

The point is that homonyms are both homophones (they sound the same) and homographs (they look the same).
