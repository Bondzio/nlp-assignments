Antennae galaxies

The Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/NGC 4039) are colliding. They are in the constellation Corvus. The process takes hundreds of millions of years. 

The collision, with its clouds of gas, dust and magnetic fields, causes rapid star formation. This is their starburst phase. They were discovered by William Herschel in 1785.

They are in the NGC 4038 group with five other galaxies. These two galaxies are known as the Antennae galaxies because they have two long tails of stars, gas and dust ejected from the galaxies as a result of the collision. The nuclei of the two galaxies are joining to become one giant galaxy.
These interacting galaxies are nearer the Milky Way than previously thoughtâ€”at 45 million light-years instead of 65 million light-years.
