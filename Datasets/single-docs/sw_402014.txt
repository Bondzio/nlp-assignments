Electronic waste

Electronic waste, or E-waste is electronic equipment that is being thrown away. It includes phones, computers, and other electronics that have passed their time and are not used any more.

E-waste is a concern for every country in the 21st century. Because of Moore's law, the rule that states transistor numbers double every two years, people upgrade computers every 3 years on average. People usually throw away their old laptops, cameras, computers, cell phones and televisions. This creates a large amount of practically useless waste. Most countries have methods to combat e waste and find a use for obsolete technology. When you take in to account all the computer users in the world, over 30 million tons of e-waste is created nearly every year, along with a few billions of tons of other waste.
