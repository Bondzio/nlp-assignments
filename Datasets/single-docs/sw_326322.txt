Bridgestone Museum of Art

The museum collects, houses, and preserves a collection of art which include Impressionists, Post-Impressionists and twentieth-century art by Japanese, European and American artists. Ceramic works from Ancient Greece are also featured. 

The Bridgestone Museum is in Kyōbashi, Chūō Ward. It is on the second floor of the headquarters of the Bridgestone Corporation.

The museum was established in 1952 by Ishibashi Shojiro. He was the founder of Bridgestone Tire Company. His personal collection of art formed the core of the museum's holdings. 

In 50 years, the collection has expanded. In 1980, the Museum gained international attention when it purchased Pablo Picasso's "Saltimbanque Seated with Arms Crossed". In 1987, the Museum bought Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "Mlle Georgette Charpentier Seated".

The museum has several works by Shigeru Aoki, including the large painting "" A Good Catch"" (海の幸 Umi no Sachi).
