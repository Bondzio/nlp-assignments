Jérémie

Jérémie (Kréyòl: "Jeremi") is a city in southwest Haiti. It is the capital city of the Grand'Anse "Département".

Jérémie is also called the "City of Poets" because of the many writers, poets, and historians that were born or live there, such as Etzer Vilaire and Émile Roumer. The father of the French writer Alexandre Dumas, père, General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, was born at Madère, near Jérémie.

The town was founded in 1756 when the country was the French colony of "Saint-Domingue". It was built where there was a small fishing town called "Trou-Jérémie".

The city is on the north coast of the Southern Peninsula, on a small bay. It is among low mountains (Bordes, Rochasse and Caracol) and almost isolated from the rest of the country, about 280 km south of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. To the southeast of the city is the River Grande-Anse.

It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has five "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Jérémie, Abricots, Bonbon, Chambellan and Moron.

Jeremie is an important Haitian port; bananas are send to other countries from this port.

There are several interesting places to visit and see in Jérémie and near the city. Some of them are:
