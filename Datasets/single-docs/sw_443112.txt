Officer Candidate School

Officer Candidate School or Officer Cadet School (OCS) are military institutions which train civilians and enlisted personnel to be officers in the armed forces of a country. Different countries and services run their Officer Candidate schools differently. Most schools are for less than one year. An OCS is different from a service academies which include academic instruction leading to a Bachelor degree. Another difference is that an OCS is taught almost exclusively by the military.
