Book of Daniel

The Book of Daniel (דניאל), originally written in Hebrew and Aramaic, is a book in both the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament.

The book says that Daniel is its writer in several places, such as 9:2 and 10:2. Jesus agreed when he spoke about " 'the abomination that causes desolation', spoken of through the prophet Daniel". The book was probably completed around 200 BCE.. This was shortly after Cyrus captured Babylon in 539.
