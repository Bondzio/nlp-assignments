Frank Kameny

Franklin Edward "Frank" Kameny (May 21, 1925 â€“ October 11, 2011) was an important person in the American gay rights movement. 

Kameny was born on May 21, 1925 in New York City, New York. He studied at Richmond Hill High School and at Queens College.

In 1957, Kameny was fired from his position as an astronomer in the U.S. Army's Army Map Service in Washington, D.C. because of his homosexuality. This helped him to begin "a Herculean struggle with the American establishment" that would help a rights movement of the early 1960s for homosexuals.

Kameny protested his firing by the U.S. Civil Service Commission due to his homosexuality, and argued this case to the United States Supreme Court in 1961. Although the court denied his petition, it is notable as the first civil rights claim based on sexual orientation. 

Kameny died on October 11, 2011 in Washington, D.C. from heart disease. He was 86 years old.

Following Kameny's death, the giant rainbow flag on the tall flagpole at the corner of Market Street and Castro Street in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco was flown at half-staff for 24 hours beginning on the afternoon of October 12, 2011 at the request of the creator of the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker.

On November 2, 2011, Kameny's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On July 3 2012, Minor Planet (40463) "Frankkameny" was named in Kameny's honor by the International Astronomical Union and the Minor Planet Center.
