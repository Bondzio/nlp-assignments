Heckler &amp; Koch G11

G11 is a German assault rifle. It has been invented by Heckler & Koch in the years between 1968 and 1990. It is able to shoot single fire, 3-Shot-Burst and full automatic. The magazin holds 45 or 50 of the 4,73mm caseless rounds. The German army (Bundeswehr) and the US Army tested the weapon but they didnÂ´t want it because it was too expensive after the Cold War. So it stayed to be a prototype and never got into mass production.
