Hurricane Kenneth (2005)

Hurricane Kenneth was the strongest hurricane in the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. After the hurricane died out, what was left of Kenneth came near another weather system, and it caused rain on the Hawaiian Islands. Because of the heavy rain, there was flooding. At Nu‘uanu Pali on Oahu, the rain reached 10.25 inches (260.4 mm). The rain was so heavy that 4.11 inches (104 mm) fell in one hour. The rain reached 12 inches (305 mm) in other areas. This made Kenneth tied for the 9th rainiest tropical storm in Hawaii. One example of the flooding was 1 foot (300 mm) of water on Hawaii Route 61. This flooded a few houses. There was flooding on some rivers.
