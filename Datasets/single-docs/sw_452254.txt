Sæhrímnir

In Norse mythology, Sæhrímnir is the name of the pig killed and cooked every night at Valhalla. He is the never-ending food source for the einherjar (warriors who died in battle and were brought to Valhalla). According to Snorri Sturluson, in the Gylfaginning, Sæhrímnir is cooked every day but he is whole again by evening.
