Line of succession to the Belgian throne

The line of succession to the Belgian throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of Belgium.

The death of King Baudouin in 1993 caused a short period of uncertainty about the succession. Prince Philippe was the expected to be the next king; but Baudouin's brother Albert became the new monarch.

Since 2009, Belgian law identifies the eldest child of a Belgian monarch the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.

In 2013, Albert abdicated for health reasons and his son, Philippe became the King.

In 2014, the current order of succession is clear.
