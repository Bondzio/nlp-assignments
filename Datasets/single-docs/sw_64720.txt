Wembley Stadium (1923)

Wembley Stadium was a sports arena in London, England. It was built in 1923 and was first known as the Empire Stadium, but because the area it was in is named "Wembley," it was renamed "Wembley Stadium." It featured twin towers by the entrance.

As well as being a sports arena, it had also been the site for several concerts. The most famous one is the Live Aid concert held there in July of 1985.

In 2000, Wembley Stadium was closed. In 2003, it was demolished, and a brand-new stadium with the same name was put up in its place.
