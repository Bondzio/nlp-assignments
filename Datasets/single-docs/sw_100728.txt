Perth, Scotland

Perth () is a city and the main part of the Perth and Kinross council area in Scotland, with around 43,450 people living there. The town was a large burgh before 1975.

Perth is named by some people as "The Fair City", though the city status in the United Kingdom said that Perth was no longer a city, until 2012 when, along with Chelmsford (in Essex, England) and St. Asaph (in north Wales), it was given city status to mark Queen Elizabeth II's 60 years on the throne.
Scotland's other six cities are Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling and Inverness.

Perth also has its own football team, St. Johnstone F.C., which plays in the Scottish Premiership, as the Scottish Premier League had its name changed in 2013.
