World Wrestling Entertainment roster

WWE is an American professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut. WWE personnel consists of professional wrestlers, managers, play-by-play and color commentators, ring announcers, interviewers, referees, trainers, producers, road agents, creative writers, and various other positions. Executives and board members are also listed.

WWE contracts typically range from developmental contracts to multi-year deals. WWE describes most personnel as independent contractors. Personnel on the main roster appear on specific brands such as Raw and SmackDown Live while they can also appear on WWE's primary weekly television programming such as Main Event, Superstars, Total Divas as well as pay-per-views, and at live events.

Personnel from the NXT division appear on the television series of the same name, which airs online in the U.S. and on TV in select countries, and at live events. Personnel on the main roster may wrestle in NXT and vice versa.

Personnel are organized below by their role in WWE. Their ring name is on the left and their real name is on the right. If someone is inactive for any reason, due to injury, suspension, not appearing in more than 30 days, or otherwise, that information is noted. WWE refers to its performers as superstars.

The following section pertains to announcers who cover WWE and NXT broadcasts. This group includes presenter hosts, ringside commentators, ring announcers, interviewers, and pre-show hosts and analysts.

Select former or retired WWE wrestlers not currently on the main roster, billed publicly as WWE Legends, have contracts to make periodic appearances-either on WWE TV or for promotional events-serving as ambassadors, public representatives/spokespeople, for the company.
