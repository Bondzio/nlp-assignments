Water purification

Water purification is the process of removing contaminants from water. One reason is to make it safe for humans to consume. Another is industrial use such as cleaning and cooling microchips during manufacturing. According to a 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) report, 1.1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water.
