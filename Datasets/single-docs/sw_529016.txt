Samira Khalil

Samira Khalil () is an activist from the Homs region of Syria. She was in prison for four years, from 1987–1991, because she opposed the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria. She disappeared in the city of Douma on December 9, 2013, with activists Razan Zeitouneh, Wael Hamada, and Nazem Hammadi. They are called the "Douma 4".

After prison, Khalil operated a publishing house. Then she worked with families of detainees. She wrote about detention in Syria. Before her kidnapping, she worked to help women in Douma to start small projects to make money. She stayed in Douma to start two centers for women.

Khalil and her husband Yassin al-Haj Saleh were in a documentary film called Baladna Alraheeb (Our Terrible Country). The film was about the period in their lives before Khalil's kidnapping in 2013.

Khalil received the Petra Kelly Prize from the Heinrich Böll Foundation in 2014. This was for her work at the Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria.
