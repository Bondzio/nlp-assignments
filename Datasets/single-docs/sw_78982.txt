Internet meme

"You might be mistaken for the normal usage for Meme"

An internet meme is something famous on the internet such as an image, a video, or even a person. Internet memes are usually created when someone published something and that thing was spread widely over the Internet. They usually consist of an image with top and bottom text. While spreading over the internet, most internet memes 'evolve' over time. With the original image/video being modified in one way or another by people other than the creator. Every internet meme evolves and has many variants. See: Memes
