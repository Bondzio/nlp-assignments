Cape May Bird Observatory

The Cape May Bird Observatory was founded in 1975 in Cape May, New Jersey, United States. The purpose of the Cape May Bird Observatory is to do research, encourage conservation, and create educational and recreational birding activities. It has two separate centers: the Center for Research and Education in Cape May Court House in the central part of Cape May County, and the Northwood Center in Cape May Point. The current director is Pete Dunne, a well-known birding author. 

Cape May is a great place for bird migration. Every spring and fall, thousands of migrating birds pass through the area. Birders from all over the world have come to Cape May to see the migrations. 

The Cape May area is home to many birding authors, including Dunne, Kerlinger, Pat and Clay Sutton, Michael O'Brien, Richard Crossley and Kevin Karlson.

The most notable former Cape May birder is author David Allen Sibley. Sibley wrote the field guide "The Sibley Guide to Birds". He wrote it while he was living and birding in Cape May Point.
