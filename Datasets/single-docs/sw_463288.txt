American imperialism

American imperialism is the economic, military, and cultural influence of the United States on other countries. At one time this influence included expansion into foreign territories. Expansionism was a primary objective of most empires, an example being the British Empire. Modern imperialism started in the 15th century when European countries discovered, and fought to claim, the New World. American imperialism began in the 1890s. In 1896 the US annexed the Hawaiian Islands. After the Spanish-American War the US annexed Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1914 the US completed the Panama Canal. The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine increased US influence in Latin America. It was the basis for Roosevelt's Big Stick policy. The US evolved from expansionism towards being an influence on world affairs.
