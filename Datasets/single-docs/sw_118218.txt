Chaldean Christians

Chaldean Christians (, "Keldayee"; ) are adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Chaldeans are the largest Christian community in Iraq, estimated at between 400,000â€“600,000. Chaldeans have generally been well integrated into Iraqi society. They have not actively sought establishment of a separate state. Many of their members are businessmen and technocrats, and a few have held high government positions. Chaldeans have always been an important part of Iraqi society. In addition to Iraq, migrant Chaldean communities are found in the United States, Turkey, Syria, Iran, and Lebanon.
