Monterey Pop Festival

The Monterey International Pop Music Festival took place from June 16 to June 18, 1967. Over 200,000 people went, and it is often seen as the beginning of the "rock era", replacing the earlier term "rock and roll". The festival was a cultural inspiration for future events. Many of the performers (like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin) became major celebrities through their appearances, while older acts (like The Beach Boys, who were scheduled to appear but cancelled) were seen as obsolete.
