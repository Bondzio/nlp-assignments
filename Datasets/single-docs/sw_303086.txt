The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be the 21st FIFA World Cup, which is a men's football tournament that takes place every four years and is organized by FIFA. The tournament will take place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights on 2 December 2010. This is the first World Cup taking place in Eastern Europe. 

The winners will qualify for the 2021 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Russia is the host country, so the Russian team automatically qualified.
