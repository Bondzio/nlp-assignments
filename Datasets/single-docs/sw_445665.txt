Cryovolcano

A cyrovolcano (also called an "ice volcano") is a type of volcano. It erupts volatiles such as water, ammonia, or methane, instead of molten rock. Cryovolcanoes are found on icy moons and might be on other places with low temperatures, like Kuiper belt objects.

Cryovolcanoes have been found on the moons Triton and Enceladus.
