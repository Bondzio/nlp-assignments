Division of Mayo

The Division of Mayo is an Australian electoral division in the hills east of Adelaide, South Australia. It includes the Adelaide Hills, Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, including the towns of Bridgewater, Crafers, Echunga, Gumeracha, Hahndorf, Langhorne Creek, Lobethal, Macclesfield, Mount Barker, Myponga, Oakbank, Stirling, Strathalbyn, Victor Harbor, Woodside, Yankalilla, and part of Birdwood.

It was set up in 1984 and is named after Helen Mayo, the first woman elected to an Australian University Council. 

Alexander Downer's father and grandfather were federal politicians. Downer was Leader of the Opposition, and became Foreign Minister in the Howard Government. His resignation from parliament caused a by-election for Mayo in 2008.
