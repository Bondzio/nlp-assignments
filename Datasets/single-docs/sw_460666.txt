Northeastern Ontario

Northeastern Ontario is a region in the Canadian province of Ontario. It includes the districts of Algoma, Sudbury, Cochrane, Timiskaming, Nipissing, and Manitoulin. Parry Sound District and District Municipality of Muskoka are sometimes included in Northeastern Ontario, although they are usually included in Central Ontario.

Northeastern Ontario is sometimes included with Northwestern Ontario as Northern Ontario. One differance between the two parts is that Northeastern Ontario has a large Franco-Ontarian population. Almost 25 percent of Northeastern Ontario's population speaks French as a first language.
