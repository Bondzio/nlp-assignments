List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin by genre

Most of Frédéric Chopin's compositions were for solo piano. He also composed piano concertos (his concertos No. 1 and No. 2 are two of the romantic piano concerto repertoire's most often-performed pieces) as well as some other music for ensembles. 

This listing uses the traditional opus numbers where they apply; other works are listed by number from the catalogues of Maurice J. E. Brown (B), Krystyna Kobylańska (KK), and Józef Michał Chomiński (A, C, D, E, P, S).


Fanciful nicknames have been given to most of Chopin's Études from time to time, although Chopin himself never used nicknames for these pieces, and none are authentic. Only about three such nicknames are widely used: Op. 10, No. 5 "Black Keys"; Op. 10, No. 12 "Revolutionary"; and Op. 25, No. 11 "Winter Wind". A number of occasionally suggested nicknames are shown below.
