Chocolate bar

A chocolate bar is a confectionery made of cocoa beans, cocoa butter, sugar, and milk. There are many types of chocolate, including milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, and many more. 

Chocolate contains a lot of calories, so it can give a person energy. However, most chocolate also contains a lot of fat.

Chocolate comes from the cacao tree. Cocoa pods grow on these trees. They get about as big as a melon. Once they are ripe, they turn from green to orange. Then workers can split them open and take out cocoa beans. Factories use machines to break down the cocoa beans into cocoa butter and chocolate. Then they add sugar and milk to make the chocolate taste better.

Cocoa farmers are some of the poorest people in the world. Many of them earn very little money.
