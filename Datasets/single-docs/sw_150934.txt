At right is displayed the color cerise. The "cerise" name comes from the French word meaning cherry. The word "cherry" itself comes from the Norman "cherise".

According to Maerz and Paul in their "Dictionary of Color", the first recorded use of "cerise" as a color name in English was in 1858. However, it was used at least as early as 1846 in a book of crochet patterns.

In the 1950s, a popular brand of colored pencils, Venus Paradise, had a colored pencil called "Hollywood cerise" . Before being renamed "Hollywood cerise" in the 1940s, the color had before that, since 1922, been known simply as "Hollywood".
