Chili pepper

Chile pepper (also spelled Chili pepper, Chilli pepper; often shortened to chile, which is not to be confused with the country called Chile) is the fruit of a series of plants called Capsicum (nightshade family). Those plants are now grown all over the world, but originally, they came from Jamaica. They are used as spices or as vegetables, and also have some use in medicine.

Chile peppers are completely unrelated to the "Piperaceae" genus, which Black pepper is from.
