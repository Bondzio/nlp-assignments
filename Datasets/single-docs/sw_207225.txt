Orbital plane (astronomy)

Orbital plane is a path traced and area enclosed by this path in 2-dimension by any celestial body while orbiting around another celestial body. For example, suppose a Planet is orbiting around a Star in perfect circular orbit, then the Circumference is orbital path of the planet and area of circle is 'orbital plane' of that Planet.
