African fish eagle

The African fish eagle ("Haliaeetus vocifer") or the African sea eagle is a large species of eagle.

It is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa where there are large bodies of open water with plenty of fish. It is the national bird of Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Sudan. As a result of its large range, it is known in many languages.

This species looks a bit like the bald eagle. They are related, but live on different continents. The bald eagle lives in North America.
