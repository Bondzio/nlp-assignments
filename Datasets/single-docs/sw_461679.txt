Prince Devitt

Fergal Devitt (born 25 July 1981) is an Irish professional wrestler. He is better known by his former ring name Prince Devitt. He is currently signed to the WWE and competes on RAW under the ring name Finn Bálor.

Devitt is previously known for his work in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). During his time there, he was a three-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and six-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion, holding the title with Minoru twice and with Ryusuke Taguchi four times. Devitt was also the winner of the Best of the Super Juniors tournament twice in 2010 and 2013. With New Japan's working promotion with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), he made appearances for them and won the NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion once. Devitt was the leader of the Bullet Club stable.

On 28 July 2014, WWE officially confirmed that they had signed Devitt to a contract and that he would report to NXT that same day.

On September 24, 2014, it was announced that his new ring name would be Finn Bálor, which is derived from Irish mythological figures Fionn mac Cumhaill and Balor, the latter also being Gaelic for "Demon King".

Bálor made his debut on the November 6 episode of "NXT" as the partner of Hideo Itami in his feud with The Ascension. He made his in-ring debut on the November 13 episode where he teamed with Itami to defeat Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd. After feuding with the Ascension for weeks, Bálor and Itami were able to defeat them at the event on December 11, where Bálor debuted his signature body paint during his entrance.
