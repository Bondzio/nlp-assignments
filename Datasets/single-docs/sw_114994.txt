Bose-Einstein statistics

In statistical mechanics, Bose-Einstein statistics means the statistics of a system where you can not tell the difference between any of the particles, and the particles are bosons. Bosons are fundamental particles like the photon.

The Bose-Einstein distribution tells you how many particles have a certain energy. The formula is

with formula_2 and where:

If formula_3, then the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann statistics is a good approximation.
