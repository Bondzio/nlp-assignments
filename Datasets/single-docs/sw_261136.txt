Unfinished building

An unfinished building is a building that was being built, but was either abandoned or is on hold. There are many different reasons why buildings have not been completed. The National Monument in Scotland was planned to be a War Memorial for soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars. Building started in 1826, but the money ran out in 1829. The Sagrada Fam√≠lia, a church in Barcelona, Spain, was started in 1882 and is still not finished. It is not finished because when the architect, Antoni Gaudi, died in 1926, and he did not leave many plans for the building. What was left was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. The war also meant that there was not enough money to complete the project.
