Dominique Venner

Dominique Venner (April 16, 1935 – May 21, 2013) was a French historian, journalist and essayist. He later became a European nationalist before withdrawing from politics to focus on a career as a historian. He specialized in military and political history. 

Venner was born on April 16, 1935 in Paris, France. He was raised in Paris, France. Venner was influenced by the writings of Ernst Jünger. He never married and had no children.

On May 21, 2013, about 4 p.m., Venner committed suicide by firearm in the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, which led to the evacuation of about 1,500 people from the cathedral. 

He had been an opponent of Muslim immigration to France and Europe, as well as what he believed to be the Americanization of European values and — most recently — the legalization of same-sex marriage in France.
