Petah Tikva

Petah Tikva, Hebrew: פתח תקווה , Arab: بتاح تكفا , meaning "door of hope", other spellings: "Petah Tiqwa" (official) and "Petach Tikvah" (unofficial), is a city in the Central District of Israel. It is 11 km east from Tel Aviv and belongs to the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. About 231,000 people were living there in 2015 and by that it is the fifth-largest city of the country. About 70,000 of them are Orthodox Jews.

European Orthodox Jews established the settlement in 1878 and named it Petah Tikva after a prophecy of Hosea. Because of this, it is the oldest agricultural settlement erected by Zionist Jews in the 19th century and therefore nicknamed "Em HaMoshavot", meaning "mother of the moshavot". It obtained city status in 1937.

The city is low-lying. The Yarkon River flows north of Petah Tikva.

Petah Tikva comes second in industrial activities. Many (Israeli divisions of) high-tech and communications companies are headquartered here. The city used to be surrounded by a lot of citrus plantations but due to urban expansion this is no longer the case.

The city hosts about 300 synagogues, the same amount of educational institutions, and six hospitals, among them the Rabin Medical Center.

Several highways are close by, like Highway 4 in the west, Trans-Samaria Highway in the north, and Trans-Israel Highway in the east.

Yarkon Cemetery is situated in Petah Tikva and is the most important cemetery of the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area.
