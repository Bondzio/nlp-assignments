National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe

National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe (in Italian: "Giorno del Ricordo") is Italian celebration in memory of ethnic cleansing's victims in massacres of Foibe and exiles from Dalmatia, Istria and "Venezia Giulia". 

Italian president Giorgio Napolitano took an official speech in which he stated:
Step for this celebration was allowed by the end of communist totalitarian regimes in Balkan nations because culpability of these crimes is of old politicians. Celebration was instituted in 2004 and first Memorial Day was held in 2005.
