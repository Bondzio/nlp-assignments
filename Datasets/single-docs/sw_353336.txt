My Way (song)

"My Way" is a song by American singer Usher. It was released from the album of the name name in 1998. It features Jermaine Dupri as backing vocalist. The song reached number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. The song did not reach number one because of Brandy Norwood and Monica's single "The Boy Is Mine". It spent 13 weeks at number two. Because "Nice & Slow" was not successful in the UK, "My Way" was not released as a single there.
