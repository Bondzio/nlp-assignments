Survivor Series (2014)

Survivor Series (2014) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by WWE. It was held on November 23, 2014 at Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the twenty-eighth Survivor Series event held by the WWE. The PPV was offered for free to new subscribers of the WWE Network.

The main event saw Team Cena (John Cena, Dolph Ziggler, Big Show, Erick Rowan and Ryback) defeat Team Authority (Seth Rollins, Kane, Mark Henry, Rusev and Luke Harper) in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag team match. A stipulation was added to the match that if Team Authority lost, they would be removed from power. If Team Cena lost, every member of Team Cena except for Cena would have been fired.

The PPV was also notable for the first appearance of former WCW and TNA wrestler Sting on WWE, who was a long hold out on signing with the company.
