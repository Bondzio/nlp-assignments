Zombieland

Zombieland is a 2009 American adventure comedy horror movie that was produced by Gavin Polone and was the directorial debut for director Ruben Fleischer.

The writers are currently planning a sequel to "Zombieland". The sequel will star the original cast and will be shot in 3-D.

A cowardly shut-in named Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is forced to join up with a seasoned zombie slayer named Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) in order to survive the zombie apocalypse. As Tallahassee sets out on a mission to find the last Twinkie on Earth, the duo meets up with Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), two young girls who have resorted to some rather unorthodox methods to survive amidst the chaos. Reluctant partners in the battle against the undead, all four soon begin to wonder if it might be better to simply take their chances alone.


The character names for Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock come from the places they are traveling in the movie.

"Zombieland" received mostly positive reviews of reviewers:


"Zombieland" debuted at #1 at the box office in North America, with ticket sales of $24,733,155 on the opening weekend and is the top-grossing zombie movie in history.
