Burgundian Netherlands

In the history of the Low Countries, the Burgundian Netherlands means a number of Imperial and French fiefs. These were ruled in personal union by the House of Valois-Burgundy and their Habsburg heirs in the period from 1384 to 1482. The area was large parts of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as Luxembourg and parts of northern France.

The Burgundian dukes who ruled the Netherlandish territories were:

House of Valois, territorial Dukes of Burgundy

House of Valois, titular Duchess of Burgundy

House of Habsburg, titular Dukes of Burgundy (see Habsburg Netherlands)
