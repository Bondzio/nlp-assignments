1977 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1977 Atlantic hurricane season started on June 1, 1977 and ended on November 30, 1977. Sometimes storms form outside these dates but that did not happen in 1977. The first storm formed on August 29, a very late start. This season was inactive, with only six storm forming. The only memorable storm is Hurricane Anita, because of its strength.


The names below were used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the 1977 Atlantic hurricane season. In this season the names Anita, Babe, Clara and Evelyn for the first time. Names that did not get used are marked in .

The name Anita was retired in spring of 1980. Because the list changed in 1979 due to adding male names, Anita wasn't replaced with a particular name.
