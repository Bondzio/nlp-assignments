Duke of York

The Duke of York (sometimes shortened to DOY) is a title of nobility and royalty in the United Kingdom. Dukedom is the highest ranking of royalty before monarch. The wife of the Duke of York is the Duchess of York. The current Duke is Prince Andrew, Duke of York. The first one was Edmund of Langley, who founded the House of York and served as the duke from 1385 until his death in 1402. During colonial times and the Act of Union, the title was changed to Duke of York and Albany, who would serve as the Duke of York and the duke of then British-occupied Albany. Since the 15th century, the title has usually been given to the second son of the reigning monarch. Since the second creation, not one of the holders of the title has ever passed it on: they either died without male heirs or became King themselves.
