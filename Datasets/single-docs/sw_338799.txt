Badghis Province

Bādghīs (Persian/Pashto: بادغیس) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan. It is in northwestern Afghanistan, between the Murghab and Hari rivers. It goes as far northward as the edge of the desert of Sarakhs. 

The province was one of the last captured by the Taliban in their military offensive before the American invasion in 2001. TheTajik people of the province never welcomed the Pashtun Taliban. The province was quickly retaken by Northern Alliance forces.

Badghis Province is in the isolated hills of northwestern Afghanistan. Its borders are Herat, Ghor, and Faryab provinces as well as Turkmenistan. 

The current Governor of the province is Delbar Jan Arman.

Agriculture is the main source of people's income. The Murghab and Hari rivers makes the land suitable for farming. The province had a bad drought in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This has gotten better. Badghis is the biggest in pistachio production in Afghanistan. It is also one of the carpet-making capitals of the country.

Badghis Province has little transportation. Qala i Naw Airport (QAQN) is the only airport.
