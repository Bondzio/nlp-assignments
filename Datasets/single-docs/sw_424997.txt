The Road Warriors

The Road Warriors were a professional wrestling tag team that competed in many different professional wrestling promotions. They were known for competing in American Wrestling Association, the National Wrestling Alliance, World Championship Wrestling, and World Wrestling Federation. The team's originally member were Road Warrior Hawk and Road Warrior Animal. 

They were joined by their manager "Precious" Paul Ellering. Droz joined the team after an angle happened that was based off of Road Warrior Hawkâ€™s real life alcohol and drug issues. The angle even went so far as to fake a suicide jump off the top of the TitanTron. The angle bombed and both members said that they disliked it and left the WWF in 1999. Their last TV appearance as a team was on the May 12, 2003 Raw episode when they faced the then-WWE World Tag Team Champions, Rob Van Dam and Kane. Road Warrior Hawk died on October 19, 2003 from heart attack.

Animal returned to the WWE in 2005 and teamed with Heidenreich. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship after defeating MNM at The Great American Bash on July 24, 2005. Heidenreich became an official member of the LOD on August 18, 2005. They were also manged by Christy Hemme during that time. They lost the tag team titles on the October 28, 2005 edition of SmackDown! to MNM in a Fatal Four-Way tag match that also featured Paul Burchill and William Regal and The Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis).

Heidenreich was released from WWE on January 17, 2006 and Animal was released a few months later.

On April 2, 2011, The Road Warriors along with Paul Ellering were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Dusty Rhodes.
