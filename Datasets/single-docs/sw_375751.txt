Kamakura shogunate

The Kamakura shogunate (Japanese: 鎌倉幕府, "Kamakura bakufu") was a feudal Japanese feudal military government. The heads of government were the shoguns. The first three were members of the Minamoto clan. The next two were members of the Fujiwara clan. The last six were minor Imperial princes.

These years are known as the Kamakura period. The period takes its name from the city where the Minamoto shoguns lived.

After 1203, the Hōjō clan held the office of "Shikken". In effect, the "shikken" governed in the name of the shoguns. 

In 1192, Minamoto no Yoritomo and the Minamoto clan established a military government in Kamakura. The shogunate functioned within the framework of the Heian system of Imperial rule.

The Mongols under Kublai Khan attempted to invade Japan. On 19 November 1274 ("Bun'ei 11, 20th day of the 10th month"), Kublai Khan's army landed near Fukuoka in Kyūshū. The invaders retreated to Korea. This was called Bun'ei War ("Bunei no eki"). There was a second invasion attempt by Mongol forces in 1281 ("Kōan 4"). This was called the Kōan War ("Kōan no eki").
The shogunate prepared to defend against a third invasion, but it did not come. The costs of defense a weakened the shogunate.

In the in 1333 ("Genkō 3"), forces led by Nitta Yoshisada destroyed the Kamakura shogunate
