Morning

Morning is the time of day from midnight to noon. Morning is usually cooler than afternoon. Many people say it is not morning until they wake up.

Many people use the morning as a time to get ready for the day. This includes things like taking a shower, eating a meal (called breakfast, because you break the fast of the night) and getting dressed. Then many people go to work or school. 

Many people buy a morning newspaper to read about what is going on in the world.
