Lesbian feminism

Lesbian feminism is a movement and point of view that asks questions about the position of lesbians and women in society. Lesbian feminism started in the early 1970s. It started because some people were unhappy with the feminism and gay liberation movements of that time.

As far back as the 1890s, lesbianism was tied to feminism. This was most common from the 1970s to early 1980s (mostly in North America and Western Europe).
