Active Worlds

Active Worlds (AW) is a 3D virtual reality platform. The "Active Worlds Browser" runs on Windows. Users assign themselves a user name, log into the Active Worlds virtual world universe, and explore 3D virtual worlds and environments that other users have created. Users can chat with one another or build structures and areas from a selection of objects. AW allows users to own worlds and universes, and develop 3D content.
