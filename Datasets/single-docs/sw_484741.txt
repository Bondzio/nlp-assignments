Pam Muñoz Ryan

Pam Muñoz Ryan is an American children's writer. She was born on December 25, 1951, in Bakersfield, California. She is the daughter of Don Bell and Esperanza Muñoz. She is the eldest of three sisters and twenty-three cousins. She took much of her inspiration for her books from her family and human rights in history.  For example, the idea for "Esperanza Rising" came from her grandmother's experiences immigrating to America. "When Marian Sang" shows the discrimination against African Americans in the theater.  She has written two novels, three books in the "Doug" series, and 13 picture books.

As a child, Ryan spent many summers biking to the local library. "The library became my favorite hangout because my family didn't have a swimming pool and the library was air-conditioned. That's how I got hooked on reading and books," she said in an interview. However, she did not realize until later that she wanted to be a writer. 

When a rich young girl named Esperanza's father dies, she and her mother are forced to move from Mexico to America. Esperanza and her mother find work with their family as farm workers. Esperanza and her mother are in fear of being deported. Although the conditions they live are bad, they could imagine how much worse their life would be in Mexico. On this journey Esperanza learns more about herself and the world around her.
