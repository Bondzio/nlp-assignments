Haitian Revolution

The Haitian Revolution (1791â€“1804) was a conflict in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, leading to the end of slavery and Haiti as the first modern republic ruled by Africans. The main leaders were former slaves Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The Haitian Revolution led to the second nation in the Americas (after the United States) formed from a European colony. It was because of Toussaint Louverture that slavery was abolished in Haiti by:

1) He assembled 20,000 fighting men, provided training, ammunition and discipline.

2) Trade with the USA; which allowed to him to export commodities and ammunition.

3) Military Alliances; he made alliances with France, Spain and Coloreds to obtain trading and ammunition.

4) Tactics; Toussaint burnt towns, threw corpses into wells and engaged opponents in the wet season.

5) Ideology; he inspired black people to pursue liberty at all costs.
