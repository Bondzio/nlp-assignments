Luxembourg City

The city of Luxembourg (, , ), also known as Luxembourg City (, , ), is a commune with city status, and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The city is at the confluence of the Alzette and Pétrusse rivers in southern Luxembourg. In the city is found the Luxembourg Castle, built by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.

During the Roman period, two main roads crossed the territory of the present city of Luxembourg; these two roads met at the place "Marché-aux-Poissons" (now a street and a neighborhood) dominated by a fortified tower. A castle was built here and it was called "Lucilinburhuc" ("small castle"). In 963, this place became a property of Siegfried I, a close relative of the Emperors of Germany and Kings of France. Siegfried built a castle, not far from the "Lucilinburhuc" castle, on a rocky cliff called the "Bock" (). This place is now considered the birthplace of the city, the country and the nation.

In 1994 UNESCO named the Old Quarters and Fortifications a World Heritage Site.
