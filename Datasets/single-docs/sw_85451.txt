Electric fish

An electric fish is a fish that can make electric fields. Fishes that can generate such fields are said to be "electrogenic", those that can detect them are called "electroreceptive". Most electrogenic fish are also electroreceptive. Many fish, for example sharks, rays, and catfishes are electroreceptive. They cannot generate electric fields though, and are therefore not classified as electric fish. Most bony fish are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive. 

Electrogenic fish have a special organ that can generate electricity. This organ is usually called an electric organ. It is usually near the tail of the fish. It is made from specialised muscle or nerve cells. When the organ produces electricity that is released this is called "electric organ discharge" (or "EOD" for short).

Based on the strength of the EOD, the electrogenic fish can be classified into two types:


In total, there are 348 known species of electric fish, in about 56 genera. The only known species that lives in salt water are the electric rays, with 23 species.
