The Fame Monster

The Fame Monster is an extra long EP (or extended play) recording created by American artist Lady Gaga in 2009. "The Fame Monster" reached the top of the charts in Australia, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland and the United Kingdom, while reaching the top ten in other major markets. Lady Gaga did a tour called the Monster Ball that lasted from late 2009 until mid-2011.

Gaga has said that the album represents the darker side of fame, and each song shows a certain fear.

The singles on "The Fame Monster" are "Bad Romance", "Telephone" (featuring R&B singer Beyonc√©), and "Alejandro". The album and "Bad Romance" received three Grammy Awards altogether. All three singles have reached the top five worldwide. In the UK, the first two singles topped the chart.

The main music genres which make up the album are pop, dance-pop, and electropop.
