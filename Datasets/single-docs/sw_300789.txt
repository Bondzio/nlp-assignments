Google+

Google+ is a social networking website run by Google. Google+ was opened to people with an invitation on June 28, 2011 for testing. The next day, people with accounts were allowed to invite friends to the service. This was stopped within a day after there was "insane demand" for accounts.

Google+ is made to work with different Google social services, such as Google Profiles and Google Buzz. It also has features including Circles, Hangouts, Sparks and Huddles. It has been said that this is Google's biggest attempt to rival the social network Facebook. 

On 14 July 2011, Google said that Google+ had 10 million users two weeks after it was opened to people with invitations. After three weeks, Google+ had 20 million users. The Google+ iPhone app was the most popular free application in the Apple App Store less than a day after it was added to the store.
