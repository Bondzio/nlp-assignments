Central line

The Central Line is a line of the London Underground. Its colour is red on the tube map. It runs east-west through London. The line was the longest line until the line between Epping and Ongar was closed. Outside the rush hours trains run every 3-4 minutes in Central London and every 6-7 minutes on the branches.
