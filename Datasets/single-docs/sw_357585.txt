Virgo Cluster

The Virgo Cluster is a cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 ± 0.3 light years (16.5 ± 0.1 million parsecs) away in the constellation Virgo. The cluster forms the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which our Local Group is an outlying member. 

The Virgo Cluster has about 1300 (and perhaps up to 2000) member galaxies. Its mass is about 1.2 solar masses out to 8 degrees of the cluster's center or a radius of about 2.2 million parsecs.

Many of the brighter galaxies in this cluster, including the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, were discovered in the late 1770s and early 1780s. They were included in Charles Messier's catalogue of non-cometary fuzzy objects. Described by Messier as nebulae without stars, their true nature was not recognized until the 1920s. Many of the member galaxies of the cluster are visible with a small telescope. Its brightest member is the elliptical galaxy Messier 49.
