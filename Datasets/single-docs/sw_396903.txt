Resolved White

Resolved White (16151687) was a passenger on the "Mayflower". Resolved was the oldest child and given his name as the family "resolved" or "determined" to make a new life for themselves. They were Separatists and did not believe in the teachings of the Church of England.

Resolved left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30â€“40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.

William White, died in 1621. Resolved's mother married Edward Winslow, another "Mayflower" passenger. The family grew and he had five step-brothers and sisters. One of his step-brothers became Plymouth Colony Governor Josiah Winslow.

When Resolved became a young man he was given 100 acres of land and later he was granted more land. In 1658 he was made a Freeman of Plymouth Colony. This gave him many rights such as the right to vote.

In 1676, Resolved was a soldier in King Philip's War of 1676 and in 1680.

White married Judith Vassall in 1640. They had seven children: William, John, ResolvedSamuel, Anna, Josiah, Susanna, 

White died in 1687 at Winslow Cemetery and was bured by his first wife Judith. The burial place of his second wife Abigail is unknown. There is also a monument in the Winslow Cemetery to "The Settlers of Green Harbor Marshfield" with Resolved White, his wife Judith, and his brother Peregrine White are mentioned.
