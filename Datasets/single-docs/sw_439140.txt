Name tag

A name tag is a badge or sticker worn on the outermost clothing as a means of displaying the wearer's name for others to view.

"Hello my name is" stickers, first introduced by C-Line Products in 1959, became hugely popular.

Many graffiti artists have been known to use these stickers as tags.
