Coral Sea Islands

The Coral Sea Islands (or Coral Sea Islands Territory) is a group of islands on the Great Barrier Reef, in the country of Australia. Some islands have automatic weather stations or lighthouses on them. Willis Island is the only island where people live; four people there run a weather station. They are in the Coral Sea, northeast of Queensland.
