Empress Jingū

, also known as was a legendary empress of Japan. Although her name was once included in the traditional order of succession, she is now considered as a regent.

Historians consider details about the life of Empress Jingū to be mythical; and the name Jingū"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.

No certain dates can be assigned to this empress's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

Jingū is almost certainly a legend; but the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" record her name.

Jingū was the principle wife of Emperor Chūai Her son would become known as Emperor Ōjin. The "Gukanshō" mentions her, but she is not included on the list of persons born within the line of Imperial descent.

The limited information about Jingū does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.

After the death of Chūai, Jingū also served as regent until her son was old enough to be emperor. 
This empress' official name after his death (her posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jingū.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the empress's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Jingū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.

In the centuries before the Meiji period, Jingū was known as the 15th Japanese imperial ruler, according to the traditional order of succession. However, Jingū's name is now removed from the official list of emperors of Japan. Jingū's son, Emperor Ōjin, is today considered to have been the 15th emperor in the order of succession.
