Time in Pakistan

Pakistan has experimented with Daylight Saving Time (DST) a number of times since 2002, shifting local time from to during various summer periods, having the effect of making Pakistan counter-intuitively half an hour ahead of India during those times, even though India is generally to its east.


Daylight saving time is no longer observed in Pakistan.
