UEFA Euro 2020

The 2020 UEFA European Football Championship (also known as the UEFA Euro 2020) will be the 16th UEFA European Football Championship. It will be in thirteen cities in thirteen different countries. This is being done because 2020 is the 60th "birthday" of the UEFA European Football Championship.
