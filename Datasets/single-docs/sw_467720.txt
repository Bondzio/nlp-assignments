Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 in 2010. It was released on Microsoft Windows in 2011. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third game in the Assassin's Creed series. 
Development for the game started some time after the release of Assassin's Creed II. An "Assassin's Creed game with multiplayer" was announced in 2009. But they did not reveal the name of the game. Someone who worked at GameSpot leaked a beta version of the game on Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft later said that these were not fake.

The game starts when Ezio Auditore returns to Monteriggioni with his uncle, Mario Auditore. He is greeted back, and settles there. He is woken up by a siege on their village by the Borgias.
