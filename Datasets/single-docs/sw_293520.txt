Fishbone

Fishbone is an American alternative rock band formed in 1979 in Los Angeles, which plays a fusion of ska, punk rock, funk, and other musical styles. Critics considered Fishbone to be one of the most distinctive and varied bands of the late '80s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious diversity, goofy sense of humor, and sharp social commentary, the group gained a large cult following during the late '80s, yet they never became mainstream.
