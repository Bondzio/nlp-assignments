George Foreman

George Edward Foreman (January 5, 1949) is an American two-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion and entrepreneur. He was born in Marshall, Texas and grew up in Fifth Ward, Houston.

He became the oldest man ever to win a major heavyweight title when, at 45, he knocked out 26-year-old Michael Moorer in the 10th round. He is still the oldest person to do that and has been named one of the 25 greatest fighters of all time by "Ring Magazine". Nicknamed "Big George", he is now a successful businessman and an ordained Christian minister.

Foreman has ten children, and each of his five sons is named George: George Jr., George III, George IV, George V, and George VI. They are also known by the nicknames "Monk", "Red", "Joe" "Big Wheel" and "Little George". His five daughters are Michi, Georgetta, Freda George, Natalie, and Leola. He also has two adopted daughters. 

Late in the 20th century he has become famous for a line of electric grill products that have his name. The grill products cook the food and allow the fat to drain off into a bowl, making the food less fatty.
