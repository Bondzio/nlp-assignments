Pop Chronicles

The Pop Chronicles were two radio documentaries. They told the story of music that was popular in America in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. John Gilliland made both documentaries.

Los Angeles Radio station KRLA 1110 broadcast the first Pop Chronicles documentary in 1969. John Gilliland, Dick LaPalm, Lew Irwin, Harry Shearer, Mike Masterson, and Richard Perry interviewed famous musicians. Len Chandler wrote and sang the theme song “The Chronicles of Pop” . The engineer and associate producer was Chester Coleman.

Other radio stations also broadcast the Pop Chronicles, including American Forces Network.

San Francisco radio station KSFO broadcast the "Pop Chronicles of the 1940s" in 1972 and 1976. The American Forces Network also broadcast this show. In 1994, Gilliland released a shorter version on audio cassette. The title of this audiobook was "Pop Chronicles the 40s: The Lively Story of Pop Music in the 40s". The audiobook was also called "The Big Band Chronicles". 

After his death, Gilliand's sister donated the "Pop Chronicles" tapes to the University of North Texas Music Library. They form The John Gilliland Collection.
