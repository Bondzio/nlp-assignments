Operation Uphold Democracy

Operation Uphold Democracy was a military operation in Haiti. It was led by the United States, with help from Argentina and Poland. It lasted from September 19, 1994, to March 31, 1995. 

In 1991, the Haitian army overthrew Haiti's legally elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and created a new military government. The goal of Operation Uphold Democracy was to remove this military government and bring President Aristide back to power. The operation was protected and supported by the United Nations through Security Council Resolution 940, passed on July 31, 1994.

Operation Uphold Democracy was successful, bringing President Aristide back into control of the Haitian government.
