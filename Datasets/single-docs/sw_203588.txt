French lavender

The topped lavender, also known as French lavender, is a perennial shrub, that usually grows up to 30-100 centimetres. The leafs are 1-4 centimetres long, in a greyish tomentose tone. The flowers are pinkish, produced on spikes 2-3 centimetres long; each flower is subtended by a bract that is 4-8 milimetres long. At the top of the spike there are many other white or lavender bracts. Many subspecies exist in Spain and other countries nearby.
