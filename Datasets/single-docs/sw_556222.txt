Arrondissement of Nice

The arrondissement of Nice is an arrondissement of France, in the Alpes-Maritimes department, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. Its capital is the city of Nice.

When the Alpes-Maritimes department was created on 1793, Nice was part of that original department.

The "arrondissement" of Nice is the most northern of the Alpes-Maritimes department. It is bordered to the northeast and east by the Piedmont region (Italy), to the southeast by the Liguria region (Italy), to the south by the Mediterranean Sea, to the southwest by the Grasse "arrondissement" and to the west by the Var department. 

The "arrondissement" of Nice is the largest in area of the two "arrondissements" of the department, , but the one with fewer people living in it (523,267 inhabitants).

After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the "arrondissements" so they could have "communes" that belong to different "arrondissements".

In the "arrondissement" of Nice, there are only two cantons where not all their "communes" are in the "arrondissement": Nice-3 and Vence. The following table shows the distribution of the "communes" in the cantons and "arrondissements":
