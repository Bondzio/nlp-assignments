Parks Australia

Parks Australia is an agency that manages national parks and conservation areas in Australia. The parks are governed by the Director of National Parks, which is a division of the federal government's Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Populations and Communities. Parks Australia looks after parks in the federal territories; those in the six states are managed by their own state-government agencies. Parks Australia provides some support to each state in managing their parklands. It also supports indigenous landholders to establish Indigenous Protected Areas.

Parks Australia manages six national parks and two botanical gardens:
Booderee, Kakadu and Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa are managed jointly with their traditional owners.
