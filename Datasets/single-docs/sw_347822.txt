List of World Heritage Sites in Ukraine

The List of World Heritage Sites in Ukraine is a group of places chosen by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO was created for the "conservation and protection of the worldâ€™s inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science". The constitution of UNESCO was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries.

Ukraine agreed to take part in the World Heritage Convention in 1988.

The World Heritage Site (WHS) list has developed over time. It is part of a process; and the list continues to grow.

There are five WHS places in Ukraine.

This UNESCO World Heritage Site includes two biosphere reserves: Carpathian Biosphere Sanctuary and the southern half of East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve (Poloniny National Park and Uzhok National Park) as well some protected Presov areas in the eastern Slovakia.

The Tentative List consists of sites which have been nominated. The evaluation process is not yet completed.
