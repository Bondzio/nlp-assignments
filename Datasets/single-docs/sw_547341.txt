World Population Day

World Population day is an annual event. It is observed on July 11 every year. This event was made to increase awareness of the problems faced by global population. It was made by the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme in 1989. It was inspired by the public interest in Five Billion Day on July 11, 1987 (approximately the date on which the world's population reached five billion people).

The world population as of December 31, 2014 is approximately 7.21 billion.
