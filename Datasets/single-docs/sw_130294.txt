Nintendo 64DD

The Nintendo 64DD (DD meaning Disk Drive) was a magnetic disk add-on for the Nintendo 64. It was considered too late in the fifth generation and flopped on its release in Japan in 1999. When it came out, the Dreamcast had already been released and soon for Nintendo fans the GameCube was developed with a built-in CD drive. For these reasons, it flopped, and few games were ever released for it. Super Mario 64 2 (sequel to Nintendo 64's 1996 Super Mario 64 was planned, but cancelled due to the commercial failure of the Nintendo 64DD. In 2004, a Ninetndo DS remake called Super Mario 64 DS and was released the same day as the original DS.
