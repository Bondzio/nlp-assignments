Burning of Jaffna library

The burning of the Jaffna library () was an attack at the central library in the city of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. It was one of the events that led up to the Sri Lankan Civil War. The first attack on the library building was on 31 May 1981. A group of Sinhalese burned the library that was one of the important libraries in Sri Lanka and one of the biggest in Asia.
