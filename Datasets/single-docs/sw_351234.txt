Northern white rhinoceros

The Northern white rhinoceros, or the Northern square-lipped rhinoceros ("Ceratotherium simum cottoni"), is one of the two subspecies of the white rhinoceros. These animals are extinct in the wild, but there are currently seven left in captivity. These seven lived in the Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic. Four of the seven rhinoceroses were transported to Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, Africa, where scientists hope they will successfully breed and save this subspecies from extinction. One of three remaining in the Czech Republic died in late May 2011. The two other rhinoceroses now live at the San Diego Zoo's Safari Park in California. 

The northern white rhinoceros eats mainly grass, and other low lying vegetation. They can live for around 40 to 65 years.
