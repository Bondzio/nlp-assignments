This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About

This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About is the first full-length album by indie rock band Modest Mouse. The album was released on Up Records on April 16, 1996. It was released in both compact disc and vinyl formats. The vinyl release contains two extra tracks, "Edit the Sad Parts" and "A Manic Depressive Named Laughing Boy". "Edit the Sad Parts" was later included on "Interstate 8" and the Up Records compilation, "US". "A Manic Depressive Named Laughing Boy" is available only on the vinyl editions released by Up in 1996 and Glacial Pace in 2014. Many of the tracks are about traveling by automobile, and the loneliness and isolation associated with rural life. "Sad Sappy Sucker" was supposed to be released before "This Is A Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About"; however, it was delayed and shelved.
