Tōhoku region

The is one of Japan's traditional regions. The Japanese conventions of geography and history divide the nation into eight regions, including the Tōhoku region. These have been used since 1905 as basic units for description and comparison and as cultural markers.

The regions of Japan are a fusion of historical divisions and modern administrative needs. The significance of the region in Japan is geographical, cultural and administrative.

"Gokishichidō" is an ancient system of names for parts of the country, including "Tōsandō". "Tōhoku" covers the northern area of the island of Honshū in roughly the same area as the traditional "Tōsandō".

In the Meiji period, the modern regional system was made by Imperial decree. Japan was divided into regions ("chihō"), including the Tōhoku region. A regional council ("chihō gyōsei kyōgisai") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping.
