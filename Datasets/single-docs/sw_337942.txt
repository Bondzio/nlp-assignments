Bar-headed Goose

The bar-headed goose ("Anser indicus") is a type of goose that lives in wetland areas of Central Asia. It has a light grey body, broad wings, and a white face and neck. Its name comes from the two stripes (or "bars") of dark feathers that wrap around the back of its head. Like other geese, its feet are webbed. They can get up to 2.5 feet long and weigh 6,5 pounds. They eat mainly grass, wheat, barley and rice.
