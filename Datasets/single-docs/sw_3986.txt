Jungle

The jungle is a place in a rain forest where the forest floor is crowded with plants. Scientists think that more types of animals and plants live in the jungles than everywhere else. When people talk about jungles, they sometimes mean the whole rainforest. They have lots of rivers or streams.

The jungle is very crammed and there is very little room to walk.
