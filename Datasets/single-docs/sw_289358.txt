Psalms 152â€“155

Pslams 152-155 are psalms of the Bible that only exist in the Syriac language translation of the Bible, which is commonly known as Peshitta. Psalms 154 and 155 also exist in a Hebrew version in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Together with Psalm 151, which only exists in some versions of the Septuagint, these psalms are sometimes called the 'Five Apocryphal Psalms of David'.
