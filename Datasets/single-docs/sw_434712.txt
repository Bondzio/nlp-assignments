Sabbath

A sabbath is a day reserved for rest or prayer, usually each week. The word "Sabbath" comes from the Hebrew word "Shabbat" (). This word is built from the Hebrew root "Sh-B-T," meaning rest. 

In the Hebrew Bible, or "Tanakh," the root "Sh-B-T" is used to describe God resting on the seventh day. This is the day after He finished creating the universe. In the Bible, the idea of "Shabbat," or "Sabbath," as a holy day of rest starts there.

Remembering and keeping Sabbath is also one of the Ten Commandments. From that, the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) all have a tradition of a holy day of rest or prayer set aside every week: Friday (Muslim), Saturday (Jewish), and Sunday (Christian). These three days are now very different from each other. The days of rest and prayer include:
