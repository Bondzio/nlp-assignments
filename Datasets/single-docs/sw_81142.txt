Theodosius I

Flavius Theodosius (January 11, 347 – January 17, 395), also called Theodosius I and Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from 379-395. He reunited the Eastern and Western Roman Empire, but was the last emperor of both parts of the empire. After his death, the two parts split permanently. He is also known for making Christianity the official state religion of the Roman Empire. 

Where Theodosius was born is disputed. According to Hydatius and Zosimus, Theodosius was born in what is now Coca, Spain. However, Marcellinus Comes writes that he was from Italica, Hispania (now is Spain). His father was was a military officer.

Theodosius died in Milan on January 17, 395.

Theodosius made the Nicene Creed the official belief system of the Roman Empire. Prior to that, many different creeds were believed. The Nicene Creed states that that Jesus, the Son, is equal to God the Father. Other people, such as Arius, said that Jesus was inferior to the Father. Theodosius affirmed the faith that the Council of Nicea agreed on.
