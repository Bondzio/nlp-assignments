Beta ferrite

Beta ferrite is ferrite that is paramagnetic instead of ferromagnetic, heated to a temperature of above 771°C.

β-Fe may refer to an unproven to exist fifth allotrope of Iron, only produced once in Uppsala University. Iron was compressed to 35-40 GPa then heated to 1500°K and scanned. The result was never reproduced.
