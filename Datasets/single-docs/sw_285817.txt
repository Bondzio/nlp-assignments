Saturn Relay

The Saturn Relay is a minivan that was built by General Motor's Saturn brand. The Relay was made by the Saturn Corporation from 2005 to 2007. The Relay was the first and only minivan made by the Saturn company. The Relay is also the only Saturn vehicle that was a badge engineered vehicle. Due to poor sales the Relay was replaced by the Saturn Outlook in 2006.
