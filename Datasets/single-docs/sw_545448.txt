Omar Mateen

Omar Mir Seddique Mateen (November 16, 1986 â€“ June 12, 2016) was an American mass shooter/mass murderer. He killed at least 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida. He was killed in a gunfight with the police. It was both the largest and deadliest shooting by a single shooter and the deadliest act of violence targeting LGBT people in United States history.
Mateen was born in New York to Afghan parents. He moved to Port St. Lucie, Florida in 1991.

Before the shooting, he had been investigated by the FBI in 2013 and 2014. Mateen reportedly pledged his allegiance to the Sunni militant jihadist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) before the shooting.
