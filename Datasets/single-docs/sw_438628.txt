Wentworth Miller

Wentworth Earl Miller III (born June 2, 1972) is an English-born American actor, model, screenwriter and producer. He is best known for his role as Michael Scofield in the Fox television program "Prison Break".

Wentworth Earl Miller III was born on June 2, 1972 in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England. He moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn at age one. His parents are Americans. His father has African-American, Jamaican, English, German, Jewish, and Cherokee background, and his mother is of Russian, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.

In 2007, Miller denied to "InStyle" that he was gay. He publicly came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website declining an invitation to attend the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival. The reason was because he felt "deeply troubled" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens. This was referring to anti-LGBT legislation enacted the previous June banning "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations".
