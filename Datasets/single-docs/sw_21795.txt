Soy milk

Soy milk (also called soymilk, soya milk, soybean milk, soy bean milk, soy drink, or soy beverage) is a milk-like product made from soybeans.

Soy milk originated in East Asia, China, a region where the soybean was native. It was used as food long before the existence of written records. Later on, the soybean and soybean foods came to Japan.
