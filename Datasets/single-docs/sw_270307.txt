Nigel Farage

Nigel Paul Farage (born 3 April 1964) is a British politician. He is the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP is a political party that wants Britain to leave the European Union. He is a Member of the European Parliament for the South East England region and is the co-chair of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament.

Nigel Farage left the Conservative Party in 1992 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed by John Major's Conservative government. He was first elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 1999 and was re-elected in 2004 and 2009. In September 2006, he was elected to become the UKIP leader and was party leader during the 2009 European Parliament election where UKIP received the second highest number of votes after the Conservative Party.

In November 2009, Farage resigned as UKIP leader because he wanted to concentrate on being elected to the House of Commons at the 2010 General Election. At the general election, Farage failed to be elected and became the UKIP leader again in November 2010.

Farage stood for election as an MP for South Thanet in 2015. He lost to Craig Mackinlay. He resigned as leader. Four days later, Farage became the leader of the party again. 

In his early twenties, Farage was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He made a full recovery.
