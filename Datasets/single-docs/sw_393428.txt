John Mutton (politician)

John Mutton (born August 5, 1966) is a former Mayor of Clarington, Ontario, Canada. He is the youngest person to become Mayor of Clarington and held office for 6 years.

John Mutton was born and raised in Bowmanville, Ontario. He graduated from Bowmanville High School, Ontario. He received a BSc from the State University of New York, USA, and a Masters Certificate, Municipal Management from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Ontario.

John Mutton was elected Mayor in 2000 at age 34. He is the youngest person to become mayor of Clarington and was one of the youngest Mayors in Canada. Mutton held office for 6 years (2000 – 2006).

He began his political career in 1997 as a Regional and Local Councillor of Clarington.

While in office, Mutton focused on greater accountability in regional government, urban development and nuclear power expansion for Clarington.

He is credited with pioneering a method to finance new construction or major additions of buildings through issue of debentures by municipal government. First employed in 2001 to fund the South Courtice Arena and Recreation Complex, it is viewed as a cost-effective method to undertake large scale publicly funded projects. 
Mutton was part of the failed Canadian bid to become the site of the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in 2003. After the loss of the project, Mutton championed for Darlington Nuclear Generating Station to become the site of a new nuclear facility in Ontario.

Mutton returned to municipal politics in 2010 in an unsuccessful bid for appointment of Regional Chair, Durham Region. He lobbied for and supported the campaign to reform the position from an appointment to one that is elected. A referendum was held in the 2010 election and 80% of voters were in favour of the reform. Durham Region Council passed By-law No. 19-2012 to change the selection method to election by general vote in 2012. Commencing in 2014, voters will elect the position. Durham Region was the second region in the Greater Toronto Area to adopt the reform.
