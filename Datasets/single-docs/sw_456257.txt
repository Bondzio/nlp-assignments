Newsboys

Newsboys is a Christian rock, pop, and worship band that started in Australia in 1985. Since then, the band has released 16 studio albums and received numerous awards. The current lead singer, Michael Tait, was once a part of the hit Christian rock/rap 90's band DC Talk.

The band started with Peter Furler, George Perdikis, John James, Sean Taylor, and Corey Pryor as "The News," which was later changed due to conflicts with a band by a similar name.
