Ice skating

Ice skating is a sport that takes up a lot of time and hard work. People wear special shoes (called skates) to skate on ice. These are preferably called boots by ice skaters themselves. Ice skates have narrow pieces of metal on the bottom of the boots called blades. The figure skaters glide across the ice by sliding on their blades. Some skaters take part in competitions and move on to be professionals.
