It is not part of a rural district, or county ().

In some states, there is another level of government, the Regierungsbezirk or governmental district. Several urban and rural districts are joined together to make a regierungsbezirk, which does some of their jobs, especially things in land-use planning which can affect several districts.

They are the equivalent of an independent city in the United States or unitary authority in the United Kingdom.

¹ "following the "Göttingen Law" of January 1 1964, the town of Göttingen is incorporated into the district ("Landkreis") of Göttingen, but the rules on urban districts still apply, as long as no other rules exist."
² "following the "Law on the region of Hannover", Hannover counts since November 1 2001 as an urban district as long as no other rules apply."

There are no longer any urban districts. The town of Saarbrücken used to be an urban district but became incorporated into the Saarbrücken Town Federation on January 1 1974.

The urban districts of Görlitz, Hoyerswerda, Plauen und Zwickau will lose their status as „kreisfreie Stadt“ probably on 1st July 2008 in a reform of Saxony's districts.
