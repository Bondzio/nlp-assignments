The Graham Children

The Graham Children is an oil painting by William Hogarth. It was painted in 1742. It measures 160.5 × 181 cm (63.2 × 71.3 in). It hangs in the National Gallery, London.

The children are painted life size, surrounded by plush furnishings and fabrics that reflect the family's wealth. A gilded bird cage is suspended from a cord and Thomas sits in an ornate baby cart with a fine silver fruit bowl at his feet. Richard plays a tune on a bird-organ which makes the bird sing.
