Charles Rennie Mackintosh

Charles Rennie Mackintosh (June 7, 1868 – December 10, 1928) was a Scottish designer who worked around the turn of the 19th/20th century. He was based in the city of Glasgow. His style is still much in demand and examples of his work are sought after and command high prices. At an auction recently a single small teaspoon was bought for £180.
