XLR connector

XLR connector is a type of electronic connector that is mostly used with audio technology. Balanced and unbalanced circuits are possible with XLR when using monosignal per one XLR connection. Sound quality improves with a balanced circuit because noise signal reduces, especially with microphones where the signal is often weak.
