2012 (movie)

2012 is a 2009 American science fiction disaster movie directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. It was produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Emmerich's production company, and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is based upon the 2012 phenomenon, which was a number of beliefs that destructive events would occur on or around December 21, 2012. It was released on November 13, 2009. Critics gave it mixed reviews. They liked its special effects, but were critical of its length (158 minutes) and screenwriting. It made $770 million worldwide.

Neutrinos from a very large solar flare from the sun cause the temperature of Earth to increase at a very fast rate, eventually causing a very large geological and meterological disaster. The plot follows Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as he tries to bring his children, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet), and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) to safety from the destructive events that occur. Among these events, a very large earthquake causes California to fall into the Pacific Ocean, the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, and a very large tsunami hits the United States.
