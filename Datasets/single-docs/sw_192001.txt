The story was told on a summer outing to three little girls. One of them was named Alice Liddell. Alice asked Dodgson to write the story down. Dodgson accepted the task. It took two years. 

The story was first called "Alice's Adventures Under Ground". When Dodgson prepared the "Alice" story for publication, he added more events, such as the Mad Hatters's Tea Party, new characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and changed the title to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". 

The story was so popular that Dodgson, (under the pen name Lewis Carroll), wrote a sequel called "Through the Looking-Glass". The Alice stories, often known as "Alice in Wonderland", are popular in music, movies and plays.

The book has been adapted many times to movies and television. These adaptations include:
