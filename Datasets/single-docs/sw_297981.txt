Milan Lucic

Milan Lucic (born June 7, 1988 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is an Canadian professional ice hockey left winger. He currently plays for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Lucic played hockey in the WHL for 3 seasons with the Vancouver Giants. He has a banner in the Giants' Hall of Fame that hangs in the stands. He has been criticized for frequent unsportsmanlike conduct, most recently his "spearings" of Alexei Emelin in May and Danny DeKeyser in April of 2014. Lucic responded to the criticism, "I’ve been in the league for seven years and I think I’ve only done that three times. I don’t know why I did it.”
