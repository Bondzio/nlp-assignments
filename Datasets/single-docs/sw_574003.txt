WWE SmackDown Women's Championship

The WWE SmackDown Women's Championship is a wrestling championship in WWE competed for by women of the "SmackDown Live" brand. It was created after the return of the brand extension. The WWE Women's Championship became exclusive of "Raw". The first champion was Becky Lynch and current is Naomi.

With the return of the WWE Brand Extension in the middle of 2016, a draft took place in July 19. The WWE Women's Champion Charlotte was drafted to "Raw". As a result, "SmackDown Live" was left without a women's title. On the August 23, 2016 episode of "SmackDown Live", Shane McMahon introduced the SmackDown Women's Championship. The first champion was crowned at Backlash on September 11, 2016, where Becky Lynch beat Alexa Bliss, Carmella, Naomi, Natalya and Nikki Bella in a six-pack elimination challenge to win te title.

As of 11, 2017.
