Governor of Massachusetts

Just like the other 49 American states, Massachusetts has its own governor. The current governor is Charlie Baker. He is a member of the Republican Party. The first governor of Massachusetts was John Hancock. 

This is a complete list of governors of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Acting governors, denoted as "A" instead of numbered, are included when the Governor resigned or died. Acting governors show a vacancy in the lieutenant governorship. They remain as Lieutenant Governors and merely "act" as governor. Lieutenant governors in Massachusetts do not ascend to the governorship upon death or resignation of their predecessor.
