Victor Emmanuel III of Italy

Victor Emmanuel III (11 November 1869 â€“ 28 December 1947) was king of Italy from 29 July 1900 to 9 May 1946. He was the son and successor of King Umberto I. He was a member of the House of Savoy.

Vittorio was born in Naples. His mother was Queen Margherita of Savoy. He became king in 1900, at age 31, after his father was killed by Gaetano Bresci.

After World War I, Benito Mussolini started the March on Rome and Vittorio Emanuele supported him. Mussolini became the Prime Minister and dictator. Because people said Vittorio Emanuele had worked together with Mussolini too much, Italy became a republic in 1946.
