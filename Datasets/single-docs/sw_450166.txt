Lycopsis

Lycopsis is an extinct genus of South American metatherian. It lived during the Miocene of what is now Colombia.

"Lycopsis" was more likely an ambush hunter than a pounce-pursuit predator, stalking small-to medium-sized prey. The borhyaenids in general were once arboreal, and later changed their life-style to one of living on the ground. The skeleton of "Lycopsis" has a mosaic of features which show it was not yet a fast runner on the ground.
