Magnificat

The Magnificat is the song that the Virgin Mary sang when she was told by the angel that she was going to give birth to God's son in Christian mythology. This is the story told in the Bible in the book of Luke Chapter 1,verses 46-55. It is also known as the Song of Mary. "Magnificat" is a Latin word meaning "magnifies" (i.e. saying how great (God) is).

The words of the Magnificat have been set to music by many composers. These musical settings were mostly written for church services. In the Anglican Church it is always sung as part of the traditional evening service (Evensong).

Like all other New Testament texts the "Magnificat" was originally written in Koine Greek, but in the Western Church it is most often to be found in Latin or the language of the country.

The Latin text from the Vulgate is as follows:
