Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is a treaty against racism and racial segregation as one of the series of international human rights law. The United Nations adopted this convention on 21 December 1965 in response to the apartheid policy of South Africa at that time.

The Article 4 of the Convention prohibits all inciting of racism including hate speech and discriminations. Article 14 gives a person or group of a country who has suffered any discrimination prohibited by this Convention the right to submit a claim to a committee of the United Nations. But not all countries that ratified the treaty include this Article.

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is a body of human rights experts who monitor the implementation of the Convention. Eighteen independent human rights experts are members. They are elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years. Nations that joined the treaty elect members by secret ballot. Each nation is allowed to nominate someone from its nation to run for election to the Committee.

Nations that have joined the treaty are required to submit regular reports to the Committee telling the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to give effect to the Convention. The first report is due within a year of the Convention entering into effect for that state; thereafter reports are due every two years or whenever the Committee requests. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the nation in the form of "concluding observations".

The Committee typically meets every March and August in Geneva.
