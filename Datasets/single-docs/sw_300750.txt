Carl Goerdeler

Carl Friedrich Goerdeler (31 July 1884 â€“ 2 February 1945) was a monarchist conservative German politician, executive, economist, civil servant, and opponent of the Nazi regime. If a plan to kill Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944 had succeeded, Goerdeler would have served as the Chancellor of the new government.

He was mayor of Leipzig from 1930 to 1937.

Goerdeler was executed by hanging.
