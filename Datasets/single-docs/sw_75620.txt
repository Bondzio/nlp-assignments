Kaaba

The Kaaba is a large cube-shaped building inside the mosque known as al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The mosque has hundreds of windows around it. The mosque was built around the original Kaaba. Muslims believe it is a reflection of a heavenly house primarily built by Adam. It is made of standard blocks, with black and gold cloth around it.

The Kaaba is the holiest place in Islam. Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage (hajj) once in a lifetime to the Kaaba. As it is the most holy place in Islam all Muslims pray towards this when they perform the five fardh (necessary acts mentioned in the Quran) Salaah or prayer. At the end of Hajj season, there is a holiday called Eid al-Adha (English: Festival of Sacrifice). Muslims who can afford to do so or who have made the Hajj must buy an animal, usually a goat, to sacrifice according to Islamic laws and cook as food or give away to the poor, if they have the money for it. Muslims believe that Abraham, one of Allah's earliest messengers, was told by Allah on the day of Eid al-Adha to sacrifice his son in Jerusalem. But the angel Gabriel congratulated Abraham's obedience to Allah and gave him a lamb instead.
