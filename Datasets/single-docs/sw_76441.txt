Port-au-Prince

Port-au-Prince (Pòtoprens in Kréyòl) is the capital city of Haiti. Haiti is also divided into ten "Départements"; Port-au-Prince is the capital of the Ouest "Département."

Port-au-Prince is Haiti's largest city. According to the country's 2015 census, over 2.6 million people lived there.

Port-au-Prince was built in 1749. At that time, Haiti was a French colony called "Saint-Domingue". Before 1770, "Cap-Français" (now Cap-Haïtien) was the capital of Saint-Domingue. In 1770, Port-au-Prince replaced "Cap-Français" as the capital of Saint-Domingue.

In 1804, the people of Haiti won the Haitian Revolution, and Haiti became an independent country. Port-au-Prince became the capital of this new country. During the French and Haitian Revolutions, it was called "Port-Républicain", before Jean-Jacques Dessalines renamed it Port-au-Prince.

Shortly after it won its independence, Haiti's new leaders divided the country between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south. Port-au-Prince remained the capital of the republic.

Port-au-Prince is the cultural centre of Haiti. The State University of Haiti ("L'Université d'État d'Haïti," or UEH, in French); the Université Quisqueya; and the "Université Caraïbe" are all located in the city.

Port-au-Prince is the nation's largest centre of economy and finance. It has the most important port in the country, where coffee and sugar are exported. Port-au-Prince has soap, textile, and cement factories, and others to process foods.

There is also an international airport about north of the city. It is named "Aéroport International Toussaint L'ouverture" after national hero Toussaint L'ouverture.
