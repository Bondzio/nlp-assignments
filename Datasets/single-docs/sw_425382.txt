Determinant

Linear algebra uses matrices. In that context, a determinant is a mathematical function that allows to associate certain matrices with a scalar. Only square matrices have determinants. That is to say that the matrix needs to have the same number of columns as it has rows. 

Originally determinants were associated with Systems of linear equations: These scalars "determined" whether a system had a unique solution.
