Internal pudendal artery

The internal pudendal artery goes in the pelvis and in the perineum (the area between the legs of a person). It is an important blood vessel for the perineum. The artery is different in women and in men. It has a lot of branches. Branches are smaller arteries which start from the "parent" artery. In men, it has branches going to muscles, the penis and the urethra (the tube which urine passes through). In women, it has branches going to the labia and the clitoris.
