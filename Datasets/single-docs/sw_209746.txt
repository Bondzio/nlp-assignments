1970 Bhola cyclone

The 1970 Bhola cyclone was the strongest storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. The Bhola cyclone made landfall in East Pakistan (today known as Bangladesh). Since the Bhola cyclone killed from 300,000 to 500,000 people, the Bhola cyclone holds the world record as the deadliest storm. Most of the people that were killed, were killed in East Pakistan (Bangladesh), because of the storm surge that caused flooding. 

The Bhola cyclone was also one of the deadliest Natural disaster in modern times. It also affected India and left $86.4 million in damage. This cyclone was the sixth cyclonic storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.
