Farid-ud-din Ganj Shakar

Hazrat Sheikh Farīd-ud-dīn Mas'ūd Ganj Shakar (1173–1266), commonly known as Baba Farid "Ganjshakar" (Punjabi, lit: 'Treasury of Sugar/Sweetness'), was a renowned Sufi preacher, mystic poet and saint of the Chishti Order of South Asia.
Fariduddin Ganjshakar is generally recognized as the first major poet of the Punjabi language, and is considered one of the pivotal saints of the Punjab and indeed, one of the "Panj Peers", or five main/great saints of South Asia. Revered equally by Muslims and Hindus, he is also considered one of the fifteen Sikh "bhagats". Selections from his work are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy scripture. 

His world-famous shrine is located in Pakpattan, in present-day Punjab (Pakistan). It was built in 1267. Each year during the Islamic month of "Muharram", special festivities are held there and pilgrims from many countries come to visit.
