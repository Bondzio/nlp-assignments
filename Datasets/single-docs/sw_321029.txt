Paranormal television

Paranormal television is a genre of popular reality television programming. It comprises factual investigations of paranormal phenomena, rather than fictional representations found in such shows as "The Ghosts of Motley Hall" and "Ghostbusters", or cartoon/children's series such as "Scooby Doo" and "Rentaghost".
