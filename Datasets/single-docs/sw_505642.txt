Wilma Mankiller

Wilma Mankiller (November 18, 1945 â€“ April 6, 2010) was the first woman to be the chief of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. She helped the Cherokee with some major problems, including unemployment, health care, and education. Mankiller helped take action on the unemployment issue by supporting new businesses. She also hugely increased the Cherokee nation's membership numbers, which was a great accomplishment. The Cherokee population increased by over 100,000 members. She survived a severe car crash, a kidney transplant, as well as a few illnesses. She died in 2010, at age 65 years from a form of cancer.
