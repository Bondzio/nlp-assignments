1982 Lebanon War

The 1982 Lebanon war was part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Lebanese Civil War. It began on 6 June 1982. Israel called it Operation Peace for Galilee. It was later known as the Lebanon war or First Lebanon war. The war started when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attacked southern Lebanon. On 3 June 1982 the Abu Nidal organization, Fatah, tried to assassinate Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov. They did it in to hurt the PLO's reputation. At the time, however, Israel believed it was the PLO behind the attempt. The shooting of the ambassador was the trigger that caused Israel’s invasion of Lebanon.
