Hida Province

In the late 1580s, Kanamori Nagachika occupied Hida Province. Kanamori's heirs held the province through the Edo Period when it came under direct rule by the Tokugawa shogunate.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Hida Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Hidaichinomiya-Minashi jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Hida.
