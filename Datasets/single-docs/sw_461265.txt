Superman: Escape from Krypton

Superman: Escape from Krypton (used to be known as Superman: The Escape) is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, United States. When it opened in 1997, it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world. It is similar to a roller coaster called Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld in Australia. The ride closed in 2010 so that it could be changed from "Superman: The Escape" to "Superman: Escape from Krypton". The new ride opened in 2011, with new trains that face backwards and with new colors.
