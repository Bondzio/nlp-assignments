Saxony-Anhalt state election, 2016

The Saxony-Anhalt state election was held on 13 March 2016 in the German State of Saxony-Anhalt for the next composition of the Parliament of Saxony-Anhalt. The incumbent Governor is Reiner Haseloff of the CDU, governing with the SPD.


The only realistic possibility would be a coalition government of the CDU, SPD and the Greens. Together, they would have a 2-seat majority . Other combinations (such as the CDU and The Left or CDU and AfD) are highly unlikely. The stark differences among the parties will make it harder for negotiations to create a coalition.
