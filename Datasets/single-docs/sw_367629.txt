We Have Survived

"We Have Survived" is a song by the Australian band No Fixed Address. It was written by Bart Willoughby when he was 18. It first appeared in the movie "Wrong Side of the Road", and was released on its soundtrack in 1980. It was later included on the band's first album "From My Eyes" from 1982.

"We Have Survived" is often sung as a kind of anthem by Indigenous Australians. It is often performed by cover bands in pubs and festivals. In 2008, it was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry.
