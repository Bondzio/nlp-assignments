The Gits

The Gits was a punk rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1986 and disbanded in 1993 after the mysterious murder of their lead singer Mia Zapata. Joan Jett who is a long time fan of The Gits wrote a song entitled "Go Home" which was inspired by the death of Mia Zapata.

The band's original name was ""Snivelling Little Rat Faced Gits"" which was named after a Monty Python skit but they later shortened it to "The Gits".
