Human Rights Campaign

The Human Rights Campaign is an organization that supports the rights of gay, bi-sexual or transgender men and women in the United States. They are the largest such group in the United States, with over 750,000 members and people who support them. The HRC works to ensure that the rights of these individuals are protected and respected throughout the United States. One issue that the HRC works on is to make sure that individuals have the right to marry people of the same sex if they want.
