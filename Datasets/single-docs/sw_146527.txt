101 Dalmatians (1996 movie)

101 Dalmatians is a movie made by The Walt Disney Company in 1996. It is a remake of the 1961 animated film "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" (which was based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel "The Hundred and One Dalmatians"). The movie's main actor is Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil. Unlike in the earlier versions of the story, the dalmatians are played by real dalmatian actors, and none of the dalmatians talk. A sequel, "102 Dalmatians", was made in 2000 and was released in November. This movie is called simply "101" in Japan, like its sequel, which is called "102".


"101 Dalmatians" was released on VHS on April 15, 1997 and as a DVD on December 12, 2000. Because many people bought the DVD, Disney re-released the film on September 16, 2008 in the United States.

The movie made lots of money when it was in movie theatres, earning $136,189,294 in the United States and $184,500,000 in other places, bringing its worldwide total to $320,689,294.
