Úrvalsdeild

The Úrvalsdeild (English: Men's Select Division) is the top Icelandic association football league. It was founded in 1912. Because of the harsh winters in Iceland, it is often played from spring to summer. It is run by the Football Association of Iceland. It has 12 clubs. As of 31 July 2015, the league was the 35th best in Europe. Since 27 April 2009, the league has also been known as the Pepsi-deildin (English: The Pepsi League) after the Football Association of Iceland and Ölgerðin signed a three-year contract together.
