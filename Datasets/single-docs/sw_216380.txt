Sadri language

The Sadri language is spoken by about 166,000 people in Bangladesh (as of 2000). 

It belongs to the Indo-European, Indo-Iranian, and Indo-Aryan language families, and is an Eastern zone Bihari language.

Sadri developed from Oraon. The Oraon people came to Bangladesh from India over 100 years ago. At some point, the Oraon people switched from using Kurux [kru], a Dravidian language, to Sadri, an Indo-Aryan language. 

Some Oraon people still speak Kurux. They are traditionally Hindu, and most are farmers. Some educated people do not use Oraon with their children. Bangladesh Oraon Foundation is working on revitalizating (repopularizing) Oraon.

People speak in these areas:

There are several dialects of Sadri, including Borail Sadri, Nurpur Sadri, Uchai Sadri, and Mokkan Tila Sadri. Speakers of these dialects may not be able to read things that are not written in their dialect. 

Sadri is written in Latin script and in Bengali script, though not many people speak Bengali.
