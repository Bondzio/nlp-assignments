León Cathedral

Santa María de León Cathedral, also called "The House of Light" or the "Pulchra Leonina" is situated in the city of León in north-western Spain. It is the third Roman Catholic cathedral to be built on the site of what was originally a Roman bath. The first cathedral was built by King Ordoño II of León. It was probably built in the Mozarabic style but was damaged in the 990s. The second cathedral was consecrated in 1073. It was built in the Romanesque style of architecture. The present Gothic style cathedral was started in 1255. It was completed about 50 years later. The cathedral has some of the finest examples of stained glass windows in all of Europe.
