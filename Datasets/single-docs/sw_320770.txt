Hōki Province

The province had borders with Inaba, Mimasaka, Bitchū, Bingo, and Izumo Provinces.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Kurayoshi. A major castle town was at Yonago.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Izu Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Shitori jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Hōki.
