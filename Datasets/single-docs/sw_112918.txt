Dutch East Indies

The Dutch East Indies, or Netherlands East Indies, was the Dutch colony that is now modern Indonesia. The main city was Batavia, now called Jakarta.
It was made from the colonies of the Dutch East India Company that came under the control of the Netherlands in 1800. During World War II it was part of the Japanese Empire. In 1945 the Japanese left, and Indonesian leaders made a declaration of independence. They fought a war of independence until the Netherlands gave Indonesia sovereignty in December 1949.
