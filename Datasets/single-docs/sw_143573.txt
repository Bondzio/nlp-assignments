Exempli gratia

Exempli gratia, mostly known in English-speaking countries by its abbreviation e.g., means "for example" in Latin.

The literal translation is "for the sake of example". Gratia means "for the sake of" and is used with the genitive case. Exempli is the genitive singular form of exemplum meaning example.

"Exempli gratia" is sometimes confused with "id est" ("i.e.")." Id est" means "that is (to say)" in the sense of "that means", or "which means", or "in other words", or sometimes "in this case".
