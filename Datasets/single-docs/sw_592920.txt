Keith Campbell (biologist)

Keith Campbell (1954- 2012) was a British biologist, who had a key role in the creation of Dolly, a cloned sheep. Campell had the crucial idea of co-ordinating the stages of the "cell cycle" of the donor somatic cells and the recipient eggs and using diploid quiscent or "G0" arrested somatic cells as nuclear donors. In fact, in 2006 Ian Wilmut admitted that Keith Campbell deserved "66 per cent" of the credit for the work on Dolly the sheep.

Campell committed suicide, aged 58 years old.
