1940 Summer Olympics

The 1940 Summer Olympics, officially known as Games of the XII Olympiad, were not held.

The games were planned for Tokyo in Japan, but the Japanese organizers withdrew in 1938 because of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

In 1938, the International Olympic Committee decided to hold the games at Helsinki in Finland.

The games were cancelled because of World War II.
