Fort Knox

Fort Knox is an U.S. Army post in Kentucky. Named after Henry Knox, the fort is now the site of the U.S. Bullion Reservatory (where the United States keeps its gold). The fort's fortifications were built in 1862 during the American Civil War; however, after the war the camp became abandoned until 1917. 

It is named for Henry Knox, a general in the American Revolutionary War.

The James Bond book and film "Goldfinger" is about somebody trying to blow up Fort Knox
