Ellipsis

An ellipsis is a type of punctuation mark. In writing, it is a row of three points (...). It is just three points; "it is never acceptable to use two or four, even if one intends a shorter or longer pause". Its name comes from the ancient Greek word "ἔλλειψις" (omission/falling short). Notice that the three dots are not spaced as full points: they are a separate special typographic sign.

Depending on context and place in a sentence, ellipses can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, a mysterious or echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. An ellipsis can be used to trail off into silence—for example: "But I thought he was..." 


When text is quoted from a book or a newspaper, it stands for words that have been cut out to save space in a page. For example:

When speaking, it can be referred to as "dot-dot-dot".
