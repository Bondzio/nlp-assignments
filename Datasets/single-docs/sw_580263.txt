J. Geils

John Warren "J." Geils Jr. (February 20, 1946 â€“ April 11, 2017) was an American guitarist. He was a member of the rock group The J. Geils Band.

Geils was born in New York City and grew up in Far Hills, New Jersey. In 1964, he went to Northeastern University and was a trumpeter in the marching band. When he was drawn to folk musicians in Boston, he left Northeastern for Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where he studied mechanical engineering.

The J. Geils Band was influenced by soul music and rhythm and blues, but it moved toward pop and rock by the time the album "Love Stinks" (EMI, 1980) came out. Their next album, "Freeze Frame", produced the song "Centerfold", which sat at number one for six weeks. Tension and conflict arose among band members, and Peter Wolf left to pursue a solo career. The band broke up in 1985.

Geils was found dead at age 71 in his Groton, Massachusetts on April 11, 2017.
