Courage in Journalism Award

The Courage in Journalism Award is a prize by the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF) for women journalists. It recognizes women who write from dangerous areas.

Since 1990, more than 100 women from 54 countries received the award. In 2014, the IWMF started a new award, the Anja Niedringhaus Courage in Photojournalism Award, named for the photojournalist killed in Afghanistan during the elections.

The 2016 award ceremonies were on October 22 in New York, and October 29 in Los Angeles.
