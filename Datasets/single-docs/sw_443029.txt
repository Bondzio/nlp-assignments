Pawleys Island, South Carolina

Pawleys Island is a seaport town in northeastern South Carolina. In 2000, 138 people lived there. This town is near Georgetown.

Many cypress cottages on Pawleys Island were built during the 20th century. That made people call the town "arrogantly shabby". In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck south of Pawleys Island. Some cottages were totally destroyed.
