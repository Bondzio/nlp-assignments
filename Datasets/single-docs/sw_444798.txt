Unit vector

A unit vector is any vector that is one unit in length.

Unit vectors are often notated the same way as normal vectors, but with a mark over the letter (e.g. formula_1 is the unit vector of a.)

To make a vector into a unit vector, divide it by its length: formula_2

Three common unit vectors used in component form are formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5, referring to the unit vectors for the x-, y- and z-axes respectively. They are commonly just notated as i, j and k.

They can be written as the following:
formula_6
