Iyo Province

Iyo had borders with Awa, Sanuki, and Tosa Provinces. 

The ancient capital city of the province was near modern Imabari. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Iyo Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"ÅŒyamazumi jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Iyo.
