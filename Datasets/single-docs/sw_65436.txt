Mary Tyler Moore

Mary Tyler Moore (December 29, 1936 – January 25, 2017) was an Academy Award-nominated American actress, activist and philanthropist.

She is famous for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" (1970–1977), where she played the role of "Mary Richards", a single woman who worked as a news producer at WJM-TV in Minneapolis, and for her role as "Laura Petrie", wife of television comedy writer "Rob Petrie" (played by Dick Van Dyke) on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961–1966).

Moore was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when she was 33. In 2011, she had brain surgery to remove a brain tumor. In 2014 friends reported that she had heart and kidney problems and was nearly blind. In October 2015, Moore's former co-star Dick Van Dyke said on an episode of "Larry King Now" that Moore was in poor health and unable to communicate.

In January 2017, she was hospitalized from a diabetic-related condition. Her condition worsened and was placed on a respirator the previous week. She died on January 25, 2017 in Greenwich, Connecticut from cardiopulmonary arrest caused by diabetic-related pneumonia, aged 80.
