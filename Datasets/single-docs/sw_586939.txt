Northern England

Northern England or the North of England, also known as the North Country or simply the North, is the northern part of England, when considered as a single cultural area. 

The area roughly spans from the River Trent to the Scottish border in the north, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331Â km (14,414 sq mi). 

Northern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanization, including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, South and West Yorkshire.
