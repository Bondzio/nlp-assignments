Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was a French writer and pilot. He wrote many stories that became famous, including "The Little Prince" (original: Le petit prince, 1943), "Night Flight" (original: Vol de nuit, 1931), and Wind, Sand and Stars (original: Terre des hommes,Land of People, 1939). Saint-Exupéry did not return from a reconnaissance flight he did near Marseille, in 1944.

A fisherman found Saint Exupery's silver bracelet near Marseille, in 1988. Two years later, the motor of the plane was found nearby.
