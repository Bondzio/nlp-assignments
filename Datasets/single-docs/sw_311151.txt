Transitivity (grammar)

Transitivity in grammar is about whether a verb has an object or not. A transitive verb has an object; an intransitive verb does not. Examples:

A transitive verb is an action verb. It expresses something doable (something possible to do). The direct object is something or someone who is the receiver of the action (verb). In the first two examples above, the 'trip' and the 'book' are the direct objects. 'Enjoyed' and 'read' are the transitive verbs.
