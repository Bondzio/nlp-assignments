Golden Temple

The Golden temple is the holiest shrines of Sikhs. Its dome was decorated with gold on its surface. The land was bought by Guru Amar Das during the period of Mughal emperor Akbar the Great. More than 500,000 people visit it each year.It was built in 1577.

Sri Harmandir Sahib is the official name of the Golden Temple. It is the holiest Gurdwara of Sikhism. It is in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. 

The fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan, designed the Harmandir Sahib to be built, and put the Adi Granth, the holy scripture of Sikhism, inside.  The Harmandir Sahib is regarded as the abode of God's spiritual attribute, but the Akal Takht is the seat of God's temporal authority.

The construction of Harmandir Sahib was intended to build a place of worship for men and woman from all walks of life and all religions to come and worship God equally. The four entrances (representing the four directions) to get into the Harmandir Sahib also symbolise the openness of the Sikhs towards all people and religions. Over 100,000 people visit the holy shrine daily for worship, and also partake jointly in the free community kitchen and meal ("Langar") regardless of any distinctions, a tradition that is a hallmark of all Sikh Gurudwaras.

The present-day gurdwara was rebuilt in 1764 by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia with the help of other Sikh Misls. In the early nineteenth century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh secured the Punjab region from outside attack and covered the upper floors of the gurdwara with gold, which gives it its distinctive appearance and its English name.

In the 1980s the Temple was the scene of fighting connected with the Khalistan movement.
