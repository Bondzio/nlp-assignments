Sassuntsi-Davit Tank Regiment

The Sassuntsi-Davit Tank Regiment (; previously the 119th Separate Rifle Tank (Mixed) Regiment) was a Soviet separate tank regiment during the Second World War. It had a lot of ethnic Armenians in it. Other ethnic groups that were in the regiment included Azeris, but they were largely relegated to logistics support and other non-combatant roles.
