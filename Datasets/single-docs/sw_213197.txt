Tōkaidō Shinkansen

The Tōkaidō Shinkansen () is a high speed railway line of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) in Japan. It is also the first high speed railway line in the world, and marked the start of Shinkansen technology.

There are totally three types of trains serving this route. When Tōkaidō Shinkansen starts operations in 1972, only "Hikari" and "Kodama" are serving this line. Among the two trains types, "Kodama" trains stop at all stations, while "Hikari" trains skip some of the stations to make the travel shorter. In early 1990s, "Nozomi" was added to the service. "Nozomi" trains skip even more station than "Hikari", which is now the fastest service on this route.
