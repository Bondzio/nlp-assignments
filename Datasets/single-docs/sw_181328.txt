It was upon this research work of national ethnic identification that the State Council could be able to announce there are 56 ethnics in China. This was also a pioneering contribution to Chinese ethnic studies. In the mean time,the world ethnic study circles had noticed this and gave a great high comment. This was the reason that ethnic study circles called professor Huang a founder of modern Chinese ethnic studies.
