Urban history

Urban history is the study of the history of urbanism. It looks into why and how cities developed. Urban history also studies the social, political, cultural and economic aspects of cities. Most urban historians focus on the larger or more important cities. There is much less attention to small cities, towns and suburbs. Urban history involves several other fields of study as they affect cities. These include archaeology, architecture, sociology, and the political and economic aspects of cities over time.
