Dutch Grand Prix

The Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Zandvoort, from 1952 to 1985.

In 1985 the company that ran the circuit (CENAV) went out of business. This marked the end of Circuit Zandvoort. The municipality of Zandvoort took over ownership. Part of the grounds and track were sold in 1987 to Vendorado, a Bungalow park developer.
