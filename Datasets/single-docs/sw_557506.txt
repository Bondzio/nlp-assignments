Sapphic stanza

Sapphic stanza is a strophe that is widely used in European poetry. It is of Greek origin. It is named after the ancient Greek woman poet Sappho. 

The stanza consists of four lines. Three of them are composed of eleven syllables and the last one is made up of five syllables. In Greek verse the quantity of syllables was important. That is, whether the syllables are long or short. In other languages it is no longer significant.
