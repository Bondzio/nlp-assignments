Yuri Lyubimov

Yuri Petrovich Lyubimov (September 30, 1917 â€“ October 5, 2014) is a Soviet and Russian actor and director, founder of the internationally-renowned Taganka Theatre. He is one of the leading names in the Russian theatre world. 

After service in the Soviet Army during the World War II, Lyubimov joined the Vakhtangov Theatre. In 1953, he received the "USSR State Prize". Lyubimov started teaching in 1963 and formed the Taganka Theatre the following year. Under Lyubimov, the theatre became the most popular in Moscow, with Vladimir Vysotsky and Alla Demidova as the leading actors. 

After Vysotsky's death in 1980, all of Lyubimov's productions were banned by the Communist authorities. In 1984, he was stripped of Soviet citizenship. Thereupon Lyubimov worked abroad before returning to the Taganka Theatre in 1989. While in the West he maintained a busy directing career. In the US he directed "Crime and Punishment" at Arena Stage and "Lulu" at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. In 1983 he directed "Crime and Punishment" in London, winning the Evening Standard Award for Best Director.

His staging of "Eugene Onegin" premiered in the Taganka on his 85th birthday to much critical acclaim.

In June, 2011 Lyubimov left the Taganka theatre. 

Lyubimov died at 97 after being admitted to the Botkin Clinic in Moscow with heart failure.
