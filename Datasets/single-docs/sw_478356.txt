Messier 81

Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy. It is in the constellation Ursa Major. It is large. It is about 12 million light-years from Earth. It has an active galactic nucleus (which has a supermassive black hole). For these reasons Messier 81 has been well studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is large and very bright. This makes it a popular object for amateur astronomers to look at.

Messier 81 was first discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1774. The galaxy is sometimes called "Bode's Galaxy". In 1779, Pierre Méchain and Charles Messier reidentified Bode's object. They listed it as Messier 81 in the Messier Catalogue.

Interstellar dust is found in the galaxy's spiral arms. It is connected with star formation areas. The hot blue stars that are found in star formation areas heat the dust. The dust is seen as infrared energy that is sent out from these areas.

Only one supernova has been seen in Messier 81. The supernova is named SN 1993J. It was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova seen in the 20th century.

Messier 81 is the largest galaxy in the M81 Group. The M81 Group is a group of 34 galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major. This Group and the Local Group, containing the Milky Way, are close together in the Virgo Supercluster. 

Messier 81 is about 10° northwest of Alpha Ursae Majoris. Messier 81 and Messier 82 can both be easily seen using binoculars and small telescopes.
