Rolling coal

Rolling coal is an activity in the U.S.A. where people who drive diesel trucks or cars intentionally remove the pollution controls. This is so the vehicle will produce black, sooty exhaust. Participants often "roll coal" on pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers of hybrid vehicles.

Pollution controls such as exhaust filters are removed. Additionally, the vehicle may be modified to deliver more fuel to the engine than usual. The turbocharger may also be disabled.
