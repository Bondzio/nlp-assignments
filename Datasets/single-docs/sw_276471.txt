Sakura Haruno

Sakura Haruno is a character from the Naruto anime and manga series. Sakura is one of Naruto Uzumaki’s fellow ninja-in-training, one-third of the team that also includes Naruto and Sasuke Uchiha. While in some ways, she’s a little stereotypically girly, she can more than hold her own throughout her team’s ninja training.
