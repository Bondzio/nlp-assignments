Marcus Aemilius Lepidus

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (born around 90 BC, died 13 BC) was a Roman politician. He was one of the closest men to Julius Caesar. He was Caesar's deputy in Rome when Caesar was away from Rome defeating Pompey in the battle of Pharsalus in Greece. He served as "Pontifex Maximus" (High Priest) after Caesar's death. 

Together with Octavian and Mark Antony he formed the Second Triumvirate to oppose the conspirators. The Triumvirate was set up to sideline the Consuls and Senate, which means it was the effective end of the Roman Republic.

Lepidus was older than the other two triumvirs. After the Battle of Philippi, he governed Spain and part of North Africa. He was blamed for a revolt in Sicily, giving Octavian the excuse to strip him of all his offices, except for Pontifex Maximus. He died peacefully in exile in Circeii in Italy in the year 13 BC.
