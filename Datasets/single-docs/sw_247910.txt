Bed bug's bites mainly show up in groups or line formations due to the bed bug's nature to feed more than once in the same area. They appear on body parts that are exposed during the sleep, like hands, feet, neck. Those bites cause intense itching for a few days after appearing.

Flea's bites are smaller and more pinkish, the ones caused by spiders are mostly big, isolated single bites revealing pierced skin. Mosquitoes' bites are more pale and the itching gradually disappear after few hours.
