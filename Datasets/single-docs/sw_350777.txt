Walking with Dinosaurs

Walking with Dinosaurs is a 1999 nature documentary series produced by the BBC. It shows how Dinosaurs lived. The first episode, "New Blood", follows a "Coelophysis" trying to survive the dry season. The next, "Time of the Titans", shows a baby "Diplodocus" growing up. The third, "A Cruel Sea", follows a flock of "Rhamphorynchus" trying to avoid deadly storms. The fourth, "King of the Skies", follows a sick male "Ornithocheirus" migrating to Spain. The fifth, "Spirits of the Frozen Forest", follows a baby "Leaellynasaura" avoiding a hungry Koolasuchus (a 4 meter salamander). The last one, "Last of the Dino Dynasty", follows a female "Tyrannosaurus" ready to mate. There is also a 2013 film with the same name, a sequel called "Walking with Beasts" and a prequel called "Walking with Monsters".
