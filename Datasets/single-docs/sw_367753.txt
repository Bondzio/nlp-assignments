Academy Award for Best Film Editing

The Academy Award for Film Editing is one of the yearly awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 

Since 1981, every movie selected as Best Picture has also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar. About two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing. 

This award was first given for movies released in 1934. The name of this award is sometimes changed. In 2008, it was listed as the Academy Award for Achievement in Film Editing.

These listings are based on the Awards Database maintained by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.








The award name was changed to Best Editing in 1999.
