Hitchhiking

Hitchhiking is a way that people can travel from one place to another. Usually, a hitchhiker (a person who hitchhikes) will stand at the side of a road and hold his or her thumb in the air waiting for the car to come and pick her or him up. This is a sign that he or she wants a car to stop and pick him/her up. The distance traveled by hitchhiking can be anywhere from walking distance to across a continent. Hitchhiking is against the law in some areas (for example around a prison in the United States).

It was a very common way of travelling in Europe in the 1970s and is still done by many people all over the world.
