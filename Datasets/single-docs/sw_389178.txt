Hemorrhoidolysis

Hemorrhoidolysis/Galvanic Electrotherapy is a treatment for hemorrhoids that is based on putting pressure with electrode on each hemorrhoid. This causes micro-shock that helps hemorrhoid to get back to norm. More than one hemorrhoid may be treated with each visit - the treatment lasts only a few minutes. The average hemorrhoid case will require only one treatment per hemorrhoid.
