Spring bud

Spring bud is the color that used to be called "spring green" before the X11 web color spring green was formulated in 1987 when the X11 colors were first invented. This color is now called "spring bud" to avoid confusion with the web color.

The color spring bud is also called soft spring green or spring green (traditional).

The first written use of "spring green" as a color name in English (meaning the color that is now called "spring bud") was in 1766.
