Cam'ron

Cameron Giles (born November 15, 1988 in Harlem, New York) is an American rapper better known by his stage name, Cam'ron or Killa Cam. 

Cam'ron was known for popularising the colour pink, which he demonstrated in his music video for "Killa Cam", where he was wearing all pink clothing and drove a pink Range Rover.

Cam'ron started the "Stop Snitchin'" campaign when he was shot outside a nightclub in his Lamborghini, which the gunman was trying to carjack. Cam'ron said in a "60 Minutes" interview that he did not know the gunman, but he did not want to help the police because he did not want to be a snitch and it would hurt his record sales. He also mentioned his Stop Snitchin' campaign in another "60 Minutes" interview when Anderson Cooper asked him, "If there was a serial killer living next to you, you wouldn't tell the police?" He replied, "I would probably move."

Cam'ron has released 7 studio albums:
