Philips CDi

The Philips CD-i was a CD-based 16-bit console released by Philips in 1991 along with the FM Towns Marty and Amiga CDTV. It shares the distinction of being one of the first CD based consoles. It was a bit of a commercial failure but still had a long console life when it was discontinued in 1998. The reason of its failure was most likely due to lack of third party support, mediocre games, and the infamous Link and Mario games.
