Supabarn

Supabarn is a small, cheap supermarket chain which started in Canberra with large shops across the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales in Australia. It was known as Supabarn Emporium in the early 2000s before becoming Supabarn Supermarkets in 2004. It sells traditional, wholefoods, and grocery and fresh food items. It was first opened in the Canberra Centre in 1991 and six more shops have been opened from that time onwards. Supabarn is one of Canberra's largest employers because it has 750 people in seven shops, with two in Sydney.
