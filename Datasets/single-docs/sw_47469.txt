The Incredibles

The Incredibles is a 2004 animated movie. It was written and developed by Brad Bird, who once directed "The Simpsons" and was best known for directing the animated movie "The Iron Giant". The movie was produced by Pixar Animation Studios, and has won an Academy Award. "The Incredibles" was originally developed as a traditionally-animated movie, but after Warner Bros. shut down its animation division, Brad Bird moved to Pixar and took the story with him.
The movie depicts a world where there are super heroes, but after an intense court hearing the government decides that all 'supers' must now go undercover and live normal lives. The main character is Rob Parr (Mr. Incredible). A sequel is scheduled to be released in 2018.
