SHeDAISY

SHeDAISY is an American country music group. They were founded in the late 1980s by sisters Kristyn, Kelsi and Kassidy Osborn. They are from Magna, Utah. The group's name comes from the word "shideezhí", a Navajo term meaning "my little sister".

The trio began their careers as The Osborn Sisters. They were signed to the Nashville division of RCA Records. The group recorded an album that was never released. By 1999 the sisters renamed the group SHeDAISY and signed to Lyric Street Records. Their first album, "The Whole SHeBANG", was released that year. The single "Little Good-Byes" from that album charted number three on the country charts. It was certified platinum in the United States. SHeDAISY has charted 15 times on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs charts. Their hits include "Little Good-Byes," "This Woman Needs", "I Will… But", "Don't Worry 'bout a Thing", and two Christmas singles.
