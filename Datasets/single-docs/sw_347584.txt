Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II

The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was an event to celebrate the reign of Queen Elizabeth II for 60 years since 1952. 

A royal on the Thames was one of several events which marked the special anniversary. The Queen and members of her family were on board the "Spirit of Chartwell" royal barge. The barge was joined by a 1,000-boat parade down the river Thames.
