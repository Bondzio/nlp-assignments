Randy Moss

Randy Moss (born February 13, 1977) is an American football player. He plays as a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers. Moss came out of retirement to play with the 49ers. He played college football at Marshall University. Moss was picked in the 1998 NFL Draft, in the first round with the 21st overall pick by the Minnesota Vikings. Moss played his NFL career with the Tennessee Titans, Oakland Raiders, Minnesota Vikings and New England Patriots, and has also played in 7 Pro Bowls. In 2007 (in which the Patriots went 16-0), Moss caught 23 touchdowns and helped quarterback Tom Brady set a record with 50 touchdown passes that year. However, he has sometimes been criticized for his lack of effort, which was most evident with Oakland and during Moss's second stint with Minnesota in 2010.
