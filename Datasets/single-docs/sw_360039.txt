Masters Home Improvement

Masters Home Improvement is the name of a series of hardware retail outlets in Australia. The chain is operated by both the Australian corporation, Woolworths Limited, and the United States-based hardware chain Lowe's. The first Masters Home Improvement store opened on 31 August 2011 to tradespeople and 1 September 2011 to the general public in Braybrook, a suburb in Melbourne. 

Masters is the main competitor of Bunnings Warehouse, which is another chain of hardware outlets operated by Wesfarmers. Masters Home Improvement stores however have many differences to Bunnings Warehouse stores, including McDonald's and McCafe outlets in some of their stores, push-buttons for customer assistance and whitegoods (refrigerators, dishwashers, washers and dryers) departments.
