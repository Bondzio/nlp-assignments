Antigua and Barbuda at the Olympics

Antigua and Barbuda were first at the Olympic Games in 1976. They have been in each Games since then, missing only the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics. They have never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

The Antigua and Barbuda Olympic Association was formed in 1966 after the end of the West Indies Federation in 1962, and recognized in 1976.
