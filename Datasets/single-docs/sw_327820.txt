Common year starting on Saturday

This is the calendar for any common year starting on Saturday, January 1 (dominical letter B). The most recent year of this type was 2011 and the next one will be 2022 in the Gregorian calendar,
or Julian years 2017 and 2023 (see bottom tables). The question mark for the ISO week before week 1 is due to ambiguity based on whether or not the previous year was a leap year. If it was, then that week is week 53, if it was a common year then it is week 52.
