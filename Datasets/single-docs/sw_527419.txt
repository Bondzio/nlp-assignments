Agathemera

Agathemera (the chinchemolle) is a phasmid insect from Chile and Argentina. It is famous for its intense odor, which is its main defence.

It is notable for its sexual dimorphism. Females are much bigger than males, at 75mm long and 16mm wide in the thorax.

This phasmid is an evolutionary isolate. It is alone in its suborder, and there are few publications about it.
