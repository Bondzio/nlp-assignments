Shirred eggs

Shirred eggs (also known as baked eggs, or in ) are eggs cooked in a manner which results in a firm white but soft or runny yolk. The name comes from the dish in which the eggs are cooked.

The eggs are placed in small dishes called ramekins with a knob of butter on top and baked at 180°C (350°F) until the white is set, but the yolk remains soft, which takes around 15 minutes.

Variations involve replacing the butter with various types of cream. Provence and Normandy have their own versions.
