Ammonium chlorate

Ammonium chlorate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NHClO. It contains ammonium and chlorate ions. 

It is a colorless solid. The chlorate is an oxidizing agent and the ammonium is a reducing agent, making it a little explosive. It explodes when in sunlight for a few minutes. It should never be crystallized as it can explode without any detonation. It can catch flammable things on fire. It decomposes completely to nitrogen, chlorine, and oxygen when heated gently.

It can be made by reacting ammonia or ammonium carbonate with chloric acid. 

It is used to make barium chlorate.
