Mimivirus

Mimivirus is a new extra-large virus. It is either a viral genus with a single species, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV), or it is a group of phylogenetically-related large viruses (MimiN). 

In speech, APMV is usually referred to as "mimivirus". Until October 2011, when an even larger virus "Megavirus chilensis" was described, it had the largest capsid diameter of all known viruses. 

Mimivirus has a large and complex genome compared with most other viruses. Mimivirus, short for "mimicking microbe", is so called to reflect its large size and apparent Gram-staining properties.
