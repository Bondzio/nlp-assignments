Belmopan

Belmopan is the capital city of Belize. There are about 20,000 people living there.

Belmopan is at an altitude of 76 metres (250Â ft) above sea level. Belmopan was built just to the east of the Belize River. It is inland from the former capital, the port of Belize City. Belize City was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in 1961. The government was moved to Belmopan in 1970. Its National Assembly Building is made to look like a Pre-Columbian Maya temple.

The University of Belize has a campus in Belmopan.
