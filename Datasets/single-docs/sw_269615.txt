Boiled egg

A boiled egg is an egg boiled in its shell. This is a common way of cooking eggs. If the shells are broken, it is called a poached egg. There are two different types of boiled eggs: hard boiled eggs and soft-boiled eggs.

Hard-boiled eggs are completely cooked. The egg yolk is solid. They can be eaten warm or cold. Some dishes use them like egg salad. They can be stored for a long time in the refrigerator. Some machines called egg slicers can slice these easily.

Soft-boiled eggs are not completely cooked. They can have salmonella in them if they are not done right. The egg yolks are liquid. They are normally scooped out of the shell and eaten. In Asia, the soft-boiled egg is cracked into a cup with soy sauce and black pepper.
