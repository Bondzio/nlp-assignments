Hysterotomy abortion

A hysterotomy abortion is a form of surgical abortion. In a hyterotomy abortion, the womb is opened, and the fetus is removed. This is similar to a Caesarean section, but requires a smaller cut.

This method has the greatest risk of complications out of all the abortion procedures. It is only used where other methods can or should not be done. It is used between the 12th and 24th week of pregnancy.
