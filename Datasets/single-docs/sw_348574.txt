Hakuchi (era)

In 650 ("Taika 6", The "daimyo" of Nagato Province brought a white pheasant to the court as a gift for the emperor. It was considered to be a good omen, and the emperor caused the "nengō" to be changed to "Hakuchi" (meaning "white pheasant").

In Japan, this was the second nengō, which was developed from the Chinese system of eras ("nianhao"). It became an example of growth in political power.

The system of Japanese era names was not the same as Imperial reign dates.
