Midnight (Warriors)

Midnight is the first book in the 2nd "Warriors" series, "The New Prophecy". The book is, like the others before it, placed in the New Forest in England. There is also some other places, like the sea, towns, and forests.

Brambleclaw starts having dreams, and they tell him to meet at the New Moon at Fourtrees. He does, and finds out that he must go on a journey to the Sun Drown Place; the sea. Meanwhile Firestar starts mysteriously trying to keep Squirrelpaw and Brambleclaw apart. They go on the journey, and find the reason that they were sent on this journey. The forest is currently being destroyed. They are shocked to see that the news comes from Midnight, a badger.

Leafpaw has a special bond with Squirrelpaw, where one feels the pain of the other, and they can know where each other is. Leafpaw uses this to tell Squirrelpaw that borage is best for rat bites. The morning the journeying cats set off, Leafpaw intercepts Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw, giving them traveling herbs. Soon, the forest starts being destroyed.
