Edge and Christian

Edge and Christian (E&C) was a professional wrestling tag team. The team was made up of legit (real life) best friends Edge and Christian. Edge and Christian are best known for competing in World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWE). During their time as a tag team, they were able to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on seven different occasions. They were first portrayed as on-screen brothers during the mid-2000s but that was later fazed out and they were announced as childhood friends in 2010.

The team split up in 2001 and reunited for a short while in 2011 but it ended after Edge had to announce to his retirement due to a neck injury on the April 11 episode of "Monday Night Raw". They were also known for competing in Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches (TLC matches) where they competed in the very first one at SummerSlam and defeated The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von).
