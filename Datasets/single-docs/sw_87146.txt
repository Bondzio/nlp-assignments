Wookieepedia

Wookieepedia (the "Star Wars" Wiki) is an online encyclopedia for information on the "Star Wars" fictional universeâ€”including information of six films, as well as Expanded Universe. It is a more specialized and useful wiki for those who wish to go farther than the basics in the "Star Wars" universe, and is almost entirely in-universe. The name Wookieepedia is a mix of Wookiee and encyclopedia, based on the name of Wikipedia. Wookieepedia is hosted by Wikia.
