Later on in July of 2011 the hit single "Moves Like Jagger" featuring pop singer Christina Aguilera was put on the deluxe edition of Hands All Over for promotional reasons. The song peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The music video premiered on E! News on August 9, 2011.

Maroon 5 began writing the songs that appear on "Hands All Over" after winding down from a world tour in support of their 2007 studio release "It Won't Be Soon Before Long". Several months later, the band received a phone call from Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who had heard that the band were beginning to write a new album, and expressed an interest in producing it. In a press release on their official website, the album is described as "a killer hybrid of rock, pop, funk and R&B".
