Proposed top-level domain

There are several proposed top-level domains that have not yet been submitted to or approved by ICANN, as of 2008.


These proposals are centered on creating an independent internet identity for linguistic and cultural communities. They are mostly inspired by the success of the .cat domain created for websites in the Catalan language or about the Catalan culture.

".kids" is a top-level domain that has been proposed by several entities. So far, none of these proposals (other than the second-level .kids.us domain) have come to fruition.

Applications for a .kids domain have included:

The European Parliament has also proposed .kid for websites designed for children. It would be monitored by an independent authority.
