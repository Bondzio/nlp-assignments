Emme river

The Emme is a river in Switzerland. The Emmental (literally: valley of the Emme) is named after it. The river is about 80Â km long, and verses itself into the Aare near Solothurn. On 13th August 1837 there was the biggest known flood of the river. Jeremias Gotthelf describes this in a story. This story, as well as other flooods led to the river being canalised in the 19th century.
