Cryptobranchoidea

Cryptobranchoidea is a suborder of salamanders. They are found in the eastern United States, China, Taiwan, and Japan. They are known as primitive salamanders. This is in contrast to Salamandroidea, or advanced salamander.

This suborder has only two families. Other families went extinct in the past and are only known as fossils.
