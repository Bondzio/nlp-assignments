The Wikipedia Revolution

The Wikipedia Revolution: How A Bunch of Nobodies Created The World's Greatest Encyclopedia is a 2008 book by Andrew Lih. It is a book about the history of the internet encyclopedia Wikipedia. It covers the period from the start of Wikipedia in early 2000 to early 2008. It has biographies of Jimmy Wales, Larry Sanger, and Ward Cunningham. Wales and Sanger started Wikipedia, while Cunningham started the first online wiki. It also talks about events in Wikipedia's history such as the Essjay controversy.

The book has a foreword (a short piece of writing found at the beginning of a book) by Wales, and an afterword (a short piece of writing found at the end of a book) by volunteers of an online wiki who talk about the problems and opportunities in Wikipedia's future.
