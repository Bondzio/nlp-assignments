Metalloprotein

A metalloprotein is a protein that contains a metal ion cofactor. A large fraction of all proteins are members of this category, so the number is very large.

It is estimated that about half of all proteins contain a metal. In another estimate, about one quarter to one third of all proteins are need metals to carry out their functions. Thus, metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins.
