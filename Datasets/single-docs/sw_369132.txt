2011 Green Bay Packers season

The 2011 Green Bay Packers season was the franchise's 91st season in the National Football League, the 93rd season overall and the sixth under head coach Mike McCarthy.

They were the defending Super Bowl 45 champions after they won against the Steelers 31-25. They not only improved from their 10-6 record but also became the sixth team to win at least 15 games. Like the 2009 Saints, 2005 Colts, and the 1998 Broncos, they won the first 13 games of the season and lost the next game. The 2009 Saints and the 1998 Broncos won their Super Bowls at that time.

Even though they had a 15-1 record, they did not repeat, because they lost to the New York Giants 37-20 in the divisional rounds.

After finishing the 2010 regular season with a 10–6 record, the Packers went 4–0 in the postseason en route to winning Super Bowl XLV. As a result, the Packers received the final selection (32nd) in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft.





The Packers started their 2011 season by taking on the Saints, the Super Bowl 44 champions. Randall Cobb not only caught his first career touchdown pass in the first quarter, but also returned a kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown. Aaron Rodgers has completed 27 of 35 pass attempts for 312 yards, 3 touchdown passes, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 132.1. With the Packers win, they began 1-0.
