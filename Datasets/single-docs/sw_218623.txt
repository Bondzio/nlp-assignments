Mossi

The Mossi are an ethnic group of people who live mostly in Burkina Faso in Africa, and also in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. They make up 40% of all the people in Burkina Faso. They speak a language called Mòoré or More.
The Mossi believe that they came from the marriage of a Dagomba princess called Yennenga (or Nyennega) and a Mandé hunter called Rialé. Yennenga was a warrior princess, daughter of a Dagomba king in Ghana. One day she lost her way and was rescued by Rialé. They got married and had a son called Ouedraogo. Ouedraogo is known as the father of the Mossi people.
