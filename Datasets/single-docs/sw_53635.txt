53 BC

Year 53 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Messalla and Calvinus (or sometimes year 701 "Ab urbe condita"). This year has been called 53 BC since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the most common way of naming years in Europe.
