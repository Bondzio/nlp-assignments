Sauropodomorph

Sauropodomorpha is the suborder of dinosaurs with massive, quadrupedal herbivores with extremely long necks and tails. 

Sauropodomorpha are divided into prosauropods and sauropods. Among the sauropods were the largest land animals ever known: "Seismosaurus", "Diplodocus", "Apatosaurus" (popularly known as "Brontosaurus"), and others.

Only the modern blue whale is larger than these creatures; no land animal comes close. "Argentinosaurus", with a vertebra over 1.59 metres long, is the largest.
