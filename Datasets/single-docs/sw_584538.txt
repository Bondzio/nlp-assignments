Pothole (landform)

Potholes or ponds are common to the rolling prairies. Found on higher ground than a marsh, a pond forms where the passage of glaciers has left holes in the landscape. The water in a pond is collected surface water. Open pond water includes the water from small streams as well as run off rain and snow. A pond will not exceed two meters in depth. As is typical in other forms of wetland, the plant life in a pond features a variety of grasses, reeds, rushes and sedges.
