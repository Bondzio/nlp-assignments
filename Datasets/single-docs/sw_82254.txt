1986 FIFA World Cup

The 1986 FIFA World Cup was a football sporting event that was held in Mexico in 1986. 24 national teams took part. Argentina won the trophy after beating Germany in the final. Diego Maradona was the best player of the tournament.






Starting with the 1994 World Cup, teams were awarded three points for a win rather than two, to encourage more offensive tactics. Had those rules been in place, Hungary would have finished ahead of Bulgaria for the 15th seed, and Uruguay would have been eliminated. The top four teams qualified for the knockout stage.
