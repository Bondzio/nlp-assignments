Law of definite composition

The law of definite proportions (or Proust's law) states that a chemical compound always has exactly the same proportion of elements by mass. 

Amounting to the same thing is the law of constant composition. This states that all samples of a given chemical compound have the same elemental composition by mass. For example, oxygen makes up about / of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining / of the mass. The law of definite proportions is the basis of stoichiometry, together with the law of multiple proportions.
