Equilibrium constant

For a general chemical equilibrium
the equilibrium constant can be defined by
where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A, etc. (activity is a dimensionless quantity). It is conventional to put the activities of the products in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator.

For equilibria in solution, activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient. Most chemists determine equilibrium constants in a solution with a high ionic strength. In high strength solutions, the quotient of activity coefficients changes very little. So, the equilibrium constant is defined as a concentration quotient:
