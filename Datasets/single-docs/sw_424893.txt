Strip club

A strip club is a type of club that has performers who dance while removing their clothes. Most strip clubs are also bars which serve alcohol. Many communities have rules on strip clubs, such as rules on how many strip clubs are allowed to exist in the community, rules on the minimum distance that must be kept between dancers and customers (e.g., the "six-foot" minimum distance in San Diego), or rules on what clothing cannot be taken off (e.g. panties).

Some strip clubs offer lap dancing, which is a type of sex work that typically involves a female dancer pressing her body against a male customer for a fee.

Strip clubs can be a source of debates in a community. Iceland banned strip clubs for feminist reasons while in Britain there is still discussion about whether they are positive for woman.
