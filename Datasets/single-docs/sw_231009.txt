Led Zeppelin III

Led Zeppelin III is the third album from the band Led Zeppelin, released on October 22, 1970. Many of the songs were written while Jimmy Page and Robert Plant visited a cottage in Wales, in a place called Bron-Yr-Aur. The musicians were inspired by the Welsh countryside, and because of this, many songs on the album are written in the style of folk and country. This upset many fans at the time who said that the band should focus on making more rock music, but there were still some rock songs on the album, such as "Immigrant Song" and "Celebration Day".
