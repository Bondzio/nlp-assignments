Digital Millennium Copyright Act

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is a copyright law that protects copyright on the internet in the U.S.A. This Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1998.

It puts into effect two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes production and distribution of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent (get round) measures which control access to copyrighted works. These "measures" are commonly known as digital rights management or DRM.

The WIPO Copyright Treaty is the basis of protecting copyright on the web.
