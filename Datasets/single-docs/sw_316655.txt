Aichi Prefecture

Aichi prefecture was created by merging Owari Province and Mikawa Province. 


Aichi has a strong industry. Cars are made here. Commerce, farming and fishing are also important areas of the economy.

Aichi faces Ise Bay and Mikawa Bay to the south. 

The prefecture borders Shizuoka Prefecture to the east, Nagano Prefecture to the northeast, Gifu Prefecture to the north, and Mie Prefecture to the west.

National Parks are established in about 17% of the total land area of the prefecture.

"Oguni jinja", "Kotonomama Hachiman-gÅ«", "Sengen jinja" and "Mishima jinja" are the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") in the prefecture.
