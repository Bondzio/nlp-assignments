Kingdom of Galicia

The Kingdom of Galicia (; ; ; ) was a political entity (a state) in southwestern Europe.

At its largest it occupied the entire northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It was founded in 409, and its capital was in Braga. 

Galicia was part of the Kingdom of the Spanish Visigoths from 585 to 711. In the 8th century Galicia became a part of the newly founded Christian kingdoms of the northwest of the peninsula, Asturias and Le√≥n. Sometimes it got independence under its own kings. 

Compostela became capital of Galicia in the 11th century. The independence of Portugal (1128) made its southern boundary. The accession of the Castilian King Ferdinand III to the Leonese kingdom in 1230 brought Galicia under the control of the Crown of Castile. The kingdom of Galicia was now a political division in the larger realm.
