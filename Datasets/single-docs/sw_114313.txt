Kirby: Canvas Curse

Kirby: Canvas Curse, known in Japan as and in PAL regions as Kirby: Power Paintbrush is a platform game made by HAL Laboratories and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS game console. It is about a character called Kirby who has to defeat a witch called Drawcia. The game is played using the touch screen only.

Kirby has to go into a painting to defeat an evil witch called Drawcia. He turns into a ball when he goes in, and the player has to use a magical item called the Power Paintbrush to help Kirby beat Drawcia.

The player uses the touch screen for everything. To move Kirby, the player has to touch him, making Kirby roll forward. The player can also draw lines with the stylus that Kirby can ride. Kirby will stick to them until they disappear, and these lines can be used to get Kirby higher or get Kirby across a pit. While "Kirby" games have Kirby eating enemies to get their powers, "Canvas Curse" does not do that. The player touches an enemy to stun it, and then has Kirby run into it. If it has a power, Kirby will gain it. To use the power, the player has to touch Kirby and he will use the power.
