Street theatre

Street theatre is a form of theatre performed outdoors. Actors take their performances to street corners, town squares, and markets. They work in public places putting on plays Generally they perform without a paying audience but depend on money dropped in a hat. Street theatre ranges from individual performances to acting companies. In Guerrilla theatre the actors are usually not professionals. They often take on social and political issues. Street theatre uses a minimum of props, costumes and sets. They often have no microphones. This means the actors have to be loud enough for the audience to hear them. It has different names in different places. In Singapore for example it is called street opera.
