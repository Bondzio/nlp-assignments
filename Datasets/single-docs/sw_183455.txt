Anne, Princess Royal

Anne, Princess Royal (born 15 August 1950) is the second child, and the only daughter, of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. 

She married Captain Mark Philips in 1973, and had two children, Peter Phillips and Zara Phillips. They separated in 1989, later divorced, and the Princess married Commander Timothy Laurence RN in 1993.

Ian Ball tried to kidnap (take) the Princess in 1974, but was stopped by her bodyguard and the public. Ball was not sent to prison, but to a mental hospital. Anne is eleventh in line to the throne of the United Kingdom, after the two younger brothers, six nieces and nephews, and one grand-nephew. She is often called the hardest working member of the British Royal Family.
