Backlash (2002)

Backlash (2002) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on April 29, 2007 at the Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri. It was the fourth Backlash event held by the WWF.

This was the first time a WWF pay-per-view was held at Kemper Arena since WWF Over The Edge 1999 where Owen Hart, competing as the Blue Blazer at the time, lost his life after he fell 78 feet from a harness to the ring during an entrance stunt and landed chest-first on the top rope, approximately a foot from the nearest turnbuckle.
