Akseli Gallen-Kallela

Akseli Gallen-Kallela (26 April 1865 â€“ 7 March 1931) was an artist from Finland. He started his career with realistic pictures of poor people from the countryside, and continued with romantic paintings of the themes of the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic. His work was considered very important for the Finnish national identity. He pioneered major changes in Finnish art. 

In addition to paintings Gallen-Kallela made prints, frescoes and designed textiles and furniture. His house and studio "Kalela" became a work of total art.

When Finland became independent, Gallen-Kallela designed uniforms and medals for its army.
