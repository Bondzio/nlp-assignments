Waterfall

A waterfall is a place where water rushes down a steep ledge. The water flows from higher land , then it falls down a big step of rock to lower land of softer rock where it will continue on its journey. Usually the lower land is in a gorge. Waterfalls are usually made when a river is young, in places where softer rock is underneath harder rock.

Many people choose them as sacred spots. The roar from a big waterfall is very loud. Some people think it is beautiful music and that a waterfall is one of the most beautiful things in nature.

The highest waterfall in the world is "Angel Falls" in Venezuela where the water falls .
