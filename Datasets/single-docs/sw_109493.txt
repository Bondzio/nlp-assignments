Southern Carpathians

The Southern Carpathians (), also called the Transylvanian Alps, are a group of mountain ranges. They divide central and southern Romania, on one side, and Serbia, on the other side. They cover part of the Carpathian Mountains that is between the Prahova River in the east and the TimiÅŸ and Cerna rivers in the west. To the south they are bounded by the Balkan mountain range of Serbia.
