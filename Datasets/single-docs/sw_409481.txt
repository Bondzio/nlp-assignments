Physical geography

Physical geography is one of the two major subfields of geography. Physical geography is related to geology, because it is about the processes and patterns in the natural environment. Some of the things this includes are the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and landforms. Physical geography influences what people do. For example, few live in deserts, and many live in cities near a big river.
