List of counties in South Carolina

The U.S. state of South Carolina is made up of 46 counties. This is the maximum allowable by state law. 

In the colonial period, the land around the coast was divided into parishes. The parishes matched the Church of England. There were also several counties that had judicial and electoral functions. As people settled the backcountry, judicial districts and additional counties were formed. This structure continued and grew after the Revolutionary War. In 1800, all counties were renamed as districts. In 1868, the districts were changed back to counties. The South Carolina Department of Archives and History has maps that show the boundaries of counties, districts, and parishes starting in 1682.
