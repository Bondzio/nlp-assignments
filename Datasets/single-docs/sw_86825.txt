Smog

Smog is a type of air pollutant; the word "smog" is a combination of smoke and fog. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area and is caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide.

It is a big problem today in Beijing, and in many other cities. London is where it first happened, but coal fires are now illegal in London. In cities like Los Angeles it is the exhaust fumes of cars which cause the smog. 

Delhi is supposed to be the most polluted city on Earth. Smogs cause lung diseases and increase the death rate. According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year.
