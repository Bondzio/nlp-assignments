Amarna

Amarna ( "al-‘amārnä") is on the east bank of the Nile in the modern Egyptian province of Minya. It is a big archaeological site with the remains of the capital city built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1353 BC), and abandoned shortly afterwards. 

The name for the city used by the ancient Egyptians is written as "Akhetaten" in English. It translates to "the Horizon of the Aten"-("Akh-t-Aten").
