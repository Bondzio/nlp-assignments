Peter Powell (kite)

Peter Trevor Powell (c. 1932 â€“ 3 January 2016) was an English kite maker. He developed a steerable kite in 1972, using dual lines. Powell's kites had spars made of Gonystylus which were later replaced with aluminium tubing and, later still, by glass fibre spars.

Powell's kites came with a long, hollow polyethylene tail that was inflated by the wind. The tail added stability as well as looking good when performing stunts. He was born in Gloucester, Gloucestershire.

Powell died from a stroke in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire at the age of 83.
