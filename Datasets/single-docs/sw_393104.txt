Public journal

Public journal (official gazette, official journal, or official diary) is the daily record of the work of an official public organization, especially of legislatures of countries and/or its administrative divisions.

Journals of this sort are also often called gazettes (state or government newspapers).

In some countries, the publication in the official journal is a condition for a law to "come into effect" or "come into force" (in which the law becomes a reality), so that people know the law (or treaty) exists, which generally releases it into the public domain. But sometimes a public journal is not always released into the public domain.
