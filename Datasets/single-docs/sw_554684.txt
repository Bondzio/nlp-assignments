Hearing test

A hearing test is a check for a person's sense of hearing to measure what kind of sounds they can hear and if they have any hearing loss. There are many types of hearing tests used to understand different things about a person's hearing. Hearing tests are also different for adults and children as well. It is mainly audiologists that do hearing tests and they will know what kind of hearing test a patient needs.

Since hearing loss does not always only make sound quieter and may make sound less clear too, there are many different hearing tests to use to understand what kind of hearing loss a person has.
