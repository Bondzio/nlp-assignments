Belarusian Wikipedia

There are two Belarusian Wikipedias: one in the orthography of the Belarusian language which is official in modern Belarus ("Narkomovka," prefix "be:"), and another one in the pre-reform of 1933, classical orthography ("Tara≈°kievica", prefix "be-x-old:").

The first Belarusian Wikipedia was started on August 12, 2004. One of its creators and first administrators was Uladzimir Katkouski (user name: rydel). Katkouski/rydel (who died in 2007) created over 1,300 articles in the Belarusian Wikipedia alone.
