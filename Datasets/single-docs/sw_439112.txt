Geocentrism

Geocentrism is the belief that the Earth is fixed at the centre of the Universe. Geocentrists accept that the earth is round. Before the 16th century most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. Geocentrism is connected with the Ancient Greek philosopher, Ptolemy. From the time of Ptolemy round the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD through to the time of Copernicus round the 15th and 16th Centuries AD educated people who knew the earth is round almost always believed the Geocentric theory of Ptolemy.

From the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers, especially Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called heliocentrism.

Geocentrism has been proven to be incorrect. However, there are still geocentrists today. In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that about 25% of Americans believe in geocentrism.
