Funassyi

Funassyi (pronounced "Funasshi") is an unofficial mascot of Funabashi City, Japan. He is a rock-star in a pear costume. Funassyi's main purpose is to promote Funabashi City. He is a singer, dancer, and a talking pear. He was a mascot which a Funabashi resident started. Now Funassyi is a famous yuru-chara (a category of mascot characters) of Japan. However, Funabashi City has not yet approved him as an official mascot.

He talks in high-pitched falsetto voice. He shouts "Nasshi" at the end of his sentences. He often says "Hyahha-" in a strange voice.
