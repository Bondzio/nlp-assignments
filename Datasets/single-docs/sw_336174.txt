Nursery

A nursery is a school for children between the ages of one and five years. It is a pre-school education institution, part of a child's education.

A nursery in England is also called FS1, which is also first year of foundation before they go into primary school.

Nursery "kindergarten" (children's garden), is a name given by Friedrich Fr√∂bel, who created the Nurseru in Germany, in 1837. Other common names are "pre-school", "playschool" and "playgroup". The German word Kindergarten is also used in many non-English-speaking countries to denote a form of pre-school education. However, in the United States, Canada, and some parts of Australia, "kindergarten" is instead the term used to describe the first year of compulsory schooling. The word "kindergarten" is not generally used in the UK.
