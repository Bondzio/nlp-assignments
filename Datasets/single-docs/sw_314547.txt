MC Ren

Lorenzo Jerald Patterson (born June 14, 1969) is an American rapper. He is best known by his stage name MC Ren. MC Ren was a member of the Gangsta rap group N.W.A.

Like all N.W.A members (except Ice Cube) he was born and raised in Compton, California. 

He joined N.W.A after completing his senior year of high school. He was with N.W.A on all their studio and EP releases. Problems over money caused N.W.A to end. MC Ren and all the other members of N.W.A went solo. 

Using Eazy E's record label, Ruthless Records, Ren released his first album "Shock of Tha Hour" in 1993.
