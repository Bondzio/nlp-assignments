Gutland

The Gutland (Luxembourgish: "Guttland") is the middle and the south of Luxembourg. It is about two-thirds of the country. About 90 percent of the people in Luxembourg live here (about 540,000 people).

The Gutland has low hills with an altitude of 200 to 300 meters.

The Gutland used to be Grevenmacher and Luxembourg Districts, and also the very southern parts of the Diekirch District.
