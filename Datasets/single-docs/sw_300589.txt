Afrika Korps

The German Africa Corps (, DAK ), or the Afrika Korps as it was popularly called, was the German army in Libya and Tunisia during the North African Campaign of World War II. The reputation of the "Afrika Korps" is synonymous with that of its first commander Erwin Rommel, who later commanded the Panzer Army Africa which evolved into the German-Italian "Panzer" Army ("Deutsch-Italienische Panzerarmee") and Army Group Africa, all of which "Afrika Korps" was a distinct and principal component. Throughout the North African campaign, the "Afrika Korps" fought against superior Allied forces right to the very end in May 1943 when it surrendered. The main composition of the "Afrika Korps" varied, but it was mostly made of the 15th Panzer Division, the 21st Panzer Division and several Italian armoured and infantry divisions, the composition of the "Afrika Korps" changed during the war.
