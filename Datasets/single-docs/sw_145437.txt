Flag of Libya

The Flag of Libya has three horizontal stripes of red, black, and green, with a white crescent and star in the center of the black stripe. It has been the official flag of Libya since 3 August 2011. The flag is the same as the flag of the earlier Kingdom of Libya, used from 1951 to 1969.

The previous flag of Libya is still used by supporters of Muammar al-Gaddafi. It was just a plain field of green. It was unique for being the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design, emblems, coat of arms, or any other details. It was adopted on 11 November 1977.
