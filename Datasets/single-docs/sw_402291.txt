Libertarian Party (United States)

The Libertarian Party is a political party in the United States, founded in 1971.

It is the third largest political party in the United States in terms of the popular vote in the country's elections and number of candidates run per election, and it is also identified by many as the fastest growing political party in the United States.

The political ideas of the Libertarian Party reflect the ideas of libertarianism: supporting less regulated markets, a less powerful state, strong civil liberties (favoring same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights), the legalization of cannabis, separation of church and state, open immigration, neutrality in diplomatic issues, staying out of other countries' wars, freedom of trade and travel to all foreign countries, and a better democracy. They also support the right to own guns.

The Libertarian Party has also supported the United States' exit from the United Nations and other organizations. Although there is not a "left" or "right" wing label to the party, it is considered by many to be more left-wing than the Republican Party but more right-wing than the Democratic Party. Many members say they are more socially liberal than the Democrats, but more conservative with money than the Republicans.

As of March 2016, there are over 410,000 voters registered as Libertarians. Hundreds of Libertarian candidates have been elected or appointed to public office, and thousands have run for office under the Libertarian banner.

The Libertarian Party has had a number of records, such as being the first party to get an electoral vote for a woman in a United States presidential election. On May 5, 2012, Gary Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In 2016, Johnson once again became the party's nominee with running mate William Weld. They would go on to win the most number of popular votes in the party's history.
