Zakia Soman (Arabic: زكية سومان ) is an activist from India. She is the head of the human rights group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA). In 2014, she received the Outstanding Women Achievers award from the National Commission for Women.

Soman is from Ahmedabad, Gujarat in India. She worked as a university professor.

Soman fights for women to be able to enter religious shrines. She works to reform Islamic divorce customs in India, and to stop the triple talaq practice of divorce in Islam for the 90 million Muslim women in India. The BMMA works for women's rights in Islam and recommended changes in India's family law. 

In 2013, the BMMA did a survey of 5000 women about women's rights in Islamic families. After that, they trained 30 women as judges to help solve family problems. In the survey, 92 percent of women had agreed to ban the one-sided triple divorce. The Shariah court for women was started because they thought that women were not being heard in the male Shariah court. In the survey, 92 percent of the women were also opposed to multiple wives.
