Fell

A fell (from Old Norse "fell", "fjall", "mountain") is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain range or moor-covered hills. The term is most often employed in Scandinavia, the Isle of Man, parts of northern England, and Scotland.

The English word "fell" comes from Old Norse "fell", "fjall" (both forms existed). It is from the same root word as the Icelandic "fjall"/"fell". Also the Swedish "fj√§ll", and Norwegian "fjell". These all refer to mountains rising above the alpine tree line.
