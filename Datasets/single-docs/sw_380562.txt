Dietrich Bonhoeffer

Dietrich Bonhoeffer (4 February 1906 in Breslau – 9 April 1945 in Flossenbürg concentration camp) was an important Lutheran pastor from Germany who was killed by the Nazis during World War II. He is known partly for his belief that killing Adolf Hitler was a moral act. In his early life he believed that all Jews should turn into Christians, but supported them anyway. He disagreed with the general anti-semitism and so created a theological college. He wrote a book called "Discipleship" about following Christianity. Eventually he became part of an attempt to assassinate Hitler, but was arrested and executed, just seven days before Hitler killed himself. He was hanged only days before the liberation of the POW camp where he was imprisoned.
