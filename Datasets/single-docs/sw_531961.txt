Competition (biology)

Competition is an interaction between organisms or species in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another. According to evolutionary theory, this competition within and between species for resources plays a role in natural selection.

Competition occurs when organisms or species need or use the same resources. Common resources are food, water and territory.
