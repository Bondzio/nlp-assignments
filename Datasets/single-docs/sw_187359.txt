Britain's Got Talent

Britain's Got Talent is a British television show on ITV and part of the "Got Talent" series. The show is presented by Ant & Dec. <br> There is one series each year; the most recent being the tenth series. The four judges of the current series are: Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams.

The winner of the show performs in front of the Queen at The Royal Variety Show and receives a cash prize of Â£250 000. 

The show started in 2007 with Ant & Dec hosting and Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan as judges. The same format was kept until the end of Series 4, when Piers Morgan announced his departure from the show. In series 5, David Hasselhoff and Michael Macintyre joined the panel, but they both only stayed for one series. In 2012, they were replaced by David Walliams and Alesha Dixon. The current panel is made up of Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams. Stephen Mulhern has been presenting the spin-off show "Britain's Got More Talent" since series 1. <br>
The show has also featured guest judges (judges who weren't permanent and most likely filled in for an ill or late judge.) Model and actress Kelly Brook was the first guest judge in 2009. Simon Cowell originally planned to keep her permanently, but she was sacked after the show's producers believed that the show would be too complicated with four judges. In 2010 and 2011, Louis Walsh filled in for fellow "X Factor" judge Simon Cowell on two occasions because he was ill. In 2012, singer Carmen Electra filled in for Amanda Holden at the audition stages because she was mourning the miscarriage of her baby. In series 10, David Walliams' mother, Kathleen Williams, filled in for Simon Cowell because he was running late.
