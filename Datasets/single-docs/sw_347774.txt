List of World Heritage Sites in Romania

The List of World Heritage Sites in Romania is a group of places chosen by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO was created for the "conservation and protection of the worldâ€™s inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science". The constitution of UNESCO was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries.

Romania agreed to take part in the World Heritage Convention in 1990.

The World Heritage Site (WHS) list has developed over time. It is part of a process; and the list continues to grow.

There are seven WHS places in Romania.

The Tentative List consists of sites which have been nominated. The evaluation process is not yet completed.
