Linking verb

A linking verb is a verb that joins the subject of a sentence to the complement. It is sometimes called a copula or a copular verb. Linking verbs do just that, "link" the action verb to what the action is.

Here are some examples of linking verbs:
('is' and 'are' are the linking verbs that connect the subject to the adjective or adjective phrase that describes it.)
Most languages have one main linking verb. In English, this is the verb "to be". We use this verb to mean the status or characteristics of something or of a person. Some languages, for example Portuguese and Spanish, have two different verbs for the two meanings of this verb. Other languages, for example Arabic and Chinese, do not have any form of this verb.
