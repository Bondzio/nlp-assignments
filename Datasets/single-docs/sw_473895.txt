Mini Metro (video game)

Mini Metro is a strategy simulation video game. It is about creating an efficient subway system for a rapidly growing city.

In this game, the player designs a subway station. The object is to get the people to their requested station. The game ends when the station becomes overpopulated. The game is simple at first. Over time, it becomes more complicated and challenging. The point of the game is to run the simulation as long as possible.

"Mini Metro" has a very modern layout. The subway cars are simply moving rectangles, the rails are simply lines, and the tunnels are dotted lines.

"Mini Metro"'s stations each are a different shape.

"Unique" Stations:

Only one of each Unique station can appear each game.
