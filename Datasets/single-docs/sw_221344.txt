The Way We Was

"The Way We Was" is the twelfth episode of "The Simpsons" second season. It first started on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1991. In this episode, Marge tells the story of how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Going back to 1974, we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by her as his French tutor. After several hours of verb conjugation, Marge falls for Homer too, only to become mad when he says that he is not a French student. Marge rejects Homer's to the prom and goes with "Artie Ziff". Artie turns out to be a bad date and Marge realizes that it is Homer she really wants.
