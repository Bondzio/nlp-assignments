Aso Kuj큰 National Park

In part, the park's name comes from Mount Aso, which is the largest active volcano in Japan. The park is also named for Mount Kuj큰 and the Kuj큰 mountains.

Aso National Park was established in 1934. When the area of the park was made larger in 1986, the park's name became Aso Kuj큰 National Park.
