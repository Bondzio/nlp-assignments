Canada Border Services Agency

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) () is the Canadian government agency with a duty to act as border guards and customs services.

The agency was started on December 12, 2003 (the same day Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada), by an order-in-council joining Canada Customs with border and law enforcement agents from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
