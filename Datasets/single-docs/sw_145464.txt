The FIA World Council approved the 2008 schedule on 24 October 2007. Singapore was Formula One's first ever night race.



 Drivers did not finish the Grand Prix, but were classified as they completed over 90% of the race distance.

A scandal developed that became known as "Crashgate" in the media, during the 2009 season around the time of the Belgium Grand Prix. Claims were made by former Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. about his crash in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. This led to charges of race-fixing against Renault. Team boss Flavio Briatore and engineering director Pat Symonds left Renault.
