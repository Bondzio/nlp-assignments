NSDAP 25 points manifesto

The 25 points manifesto is a 25 point plan written by Adolf Hitler and Anton Drexler for the National Socialist German Workers' Party when it was founded in 1920.

The purpose of the 25 points was explained in the fifth chapter of the second volume of Mein Kampf:


The leaders of the Party promise to work—if need be to sacrifice their very lives—to put this programme into action.
