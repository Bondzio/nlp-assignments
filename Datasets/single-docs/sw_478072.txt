Five Nights at Freddy's 2

Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a survival horror point and click video game. It was created by Scott Cawthon. It is a prequel to "Five Nights at Freddy's".

The player plays a security guard in a new pizzeria. His job is to watch the animatronics, and make sure nothing enters or leaves. He must survive 5 nights to be paid. There are 10 animatronics. They are not working correctly and believe you have done a crime. The guard has a camera to check all the rooms. He also has a Freddy's mask to fool the animatronics.

The old animatronics from "Five Nights at Freddy's" have been replaced with toy versions, but the old ones are still there and can still kill you. There is also a Puppet in a box and a Balloon Boy animatronic. Many people in the community believe that "Five Nights at Freddy's 2" happens before the first one.
