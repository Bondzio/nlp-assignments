Countdown (game show)

Countdown is a British game show on Channel 4. It began on 2 November 1982. It is currently presented by Nick Hewer and Rachel Riley; etymologist Susie Dent is in the dictionary corner. It used to be hosted by Richard Whiteley until his death in 2005, then by Des Lynam from 2005 to 2006, and then by Des O'Connor from 2007 to 2008. Both O'Connor and Carol Vorderman, the show's co-host, who had been on the programme since it began, left the show in December 2008. From 2009, Jeff Stelling and Rachel Riley replaced O'Connor and Vorderman respectively. It has been hosted by Nick Hewer since 2012. The show was 30 minutes long, but since 2001, it is 45 minutes long.

With over 5,000 episodes, it is one of the longest-running game shows in the world, along with the original French version "Des chiffres et des lettres" which has been running on French television continuously since 1965.
