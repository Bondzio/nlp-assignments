Weston-on-Trent

Weston-on-Trent is a village and parish in Derbyshire. It is to the north of the River Trent. At the 2004 census there were about 800 people in the village aged sixteen to seventy-four years.

In 1009 Æþelræd Unræd (King Ethelred the Unready) signed a document which agreed the size of Weston. The document shows that Weston owned the crossings of the River Trent. These crossings were for one of the roads going up or down England. The land was at Weston upon Trent and at Morley, Smalley, Ingleby, Crich and Kidsley. This land was given to Morcar, the King's chief minister. Morcar could decide a person's life or death without the King.
