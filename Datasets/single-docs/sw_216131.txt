Epistle of Jude

The Epistle of Jude is the sixty-fifth book in the Christian Bible, and the twenty-sixth in the New Testament. It is one of the shortest books in the Bible, at only 25 verses long.

This book is believed to be a letter from Jude the Apostle. The writer warns of "people who change the message about the grace of God in order to excuse their immoral ways" (verse 4).
