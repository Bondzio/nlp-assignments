Borderline intelligence

Borderline intelligence (also called borderline intellectual functioning or borderline mental disability) is a category of intelligence in which a person has lower than normal mental ability. IQ levels in this case are between 70 and 85. It is not as bad as intellectual disability (IQ 69 and under).

In school years, people with borderline intelligence are known as "slow learners".

Although borderline intelligence is a cognitive impairment, they will not always get special education.
