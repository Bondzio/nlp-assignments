Actinobacteria

The Actinobacteria are a group of gram-positive bacteria. Most are found in the soil. They include some of the most common soil life, playing important roles in decomposition and humus formation. 

Some, like "Streptomyces", were originally classified as fungi, because they form branching filaments like hyphae. All Actinobacteria are aerobic. A few forms are pathogens, such as "Mycobacterium". Some are thermophilic.
