Balaur

Balaur is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in southern Europe during the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago. It is unique because, unlike most other dromaeosaurs, it had two sickle claws on each foot, not just one. 

It was discovered in 2010. "Balaur" lived on a large prehistoric island called Hateg Island. Seventy million years ago, sea levels were much higher than they are today. Europe was an archipelago of islands. Possibly because it was relatively isolated from other dinosaurs, "Balaur" developed unique features. "Balaur" was relatively small, with an overall length of about . This would be an example of island dwarfism.

There is one known species, "Balaur bondoc". "Balaur" was a velociraptorine. Studies have shown that it is most closely related to the famous Asian dromaeosaurid "Velociraptor".
