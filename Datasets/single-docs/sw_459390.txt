Transport in Hong Kong

Hong Kong has a complex transport network. It includes both public and private transport. Over 90% of the daily use is on public transport. That is the highest rate in the world. 

The Octopus card is an electronic money system. It became available in September 1997. Passengers can use it in every station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. The card can be used to pay for public transport, parking meters, convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants and most vending machines.
