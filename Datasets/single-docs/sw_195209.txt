Bernard Herrmann

Bernard Herrmann (June 29, 1911 â€“ December 24, 1975) was an American composer known for writing music for movies. 

He won the Academy Award for the movie "The Devil and Daniel Webster" made in 1941. Herrmann often worked with director Alfred Hitchcock, including "Psycho", "North by Northwest", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", and "Vertigo". He also wrote music for many other movies, including "Citizen Kane", "Cape Fear" and "Taxi Driver". He also wrote music for radio drama including works for Orson Welles. He wrote for several fantasy movies by Ray Harryhausen, and many television programs.

"Note: This is by the date of release, not when they were written"
These works are for a speaker and a full orchestra. These were written to be played over the radio because a human voice would not be able to be heard over the full volume of an orchestra. The 1935 works were written before June 1935.
