Thou (unit)

The thou (abbreviation th) or mil (Chiefly United States) is a unit of length in the Imperial System and the United States Customary Units. It is equal to of an inch.

Thou comes from the Germanic Languages, a shortening of "thousandth".

Mil comes from the Latin Languages, a shortening of "mille".

The thou was introduced in 1844 by as a substitute to traditional fractions such as which cannot be defined simply in hundredths unlike (0.25) or (0.5). Traditional fractions continued to be used, as they were a substantial part of other units of length.

The thou is used in engineering and manufacturing mostly.
