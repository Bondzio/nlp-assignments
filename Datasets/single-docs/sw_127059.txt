Nevermind

Nevermind is the second studio album by the American grunge band, Nirvana. It was produced by Butch Vig. While the album before this, "Bleach", was not very popular, "Nevermind" was. It had 4 singles: "Smells Like Teen Spirit," "Come as You Are," "In Bloom," and "Lithium." There was some controversy because of a child's penis visible on the front cover. The album is often named one of the best albums of all time by companies like Rolling Stone and Time.
