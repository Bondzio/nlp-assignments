WrestleMania 29

WrestleMania XXIX was the twenty-ninth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by WWE. It took place on April 7, 2013 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The event was the fifth WrestleMania in the New York metropolitan area and the third WrestleMania held in the state of New Jersey.

There was an 8-man mixed tag team match scheduled between Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay & "Sweet T" Tensai) (with Cameron & Naomi) and Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes & Damien Sandow) (with The Bella Twins) but the match was pulled from the card on short notice because of time constraints.
