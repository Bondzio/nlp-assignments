It is an annual forum of cinematographers, and a place of regular meetings and an exchange of experience, of further cooperation, between moviemakers of Russia, Muslim countries and the entire world. Not only Muslims can take part, but also representatives of other faiths creating movies, popularizing universal spiritually-moral and cultural traditions.

In the first, it was supposed to be a mobile festival between Muslim regions in Russia and other states of the Muslim world. The city of Kazan ws chosen because it is the biggest Islamic city in the northern hemisphere. 

Nevertheless, after the phenomenal success and wide popularity in the whole world, and especially in the countries of the Islamic world, President of the Republic Tatarstan insisted that KIFMC should be the Culture Brand of the capital of the Republic "Kazan" which became the permanent residence for the festival, and City name has been added to the name of the festival.
