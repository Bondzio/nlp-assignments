Basic Instinct

Basic Instinct is a 1992 American erotic thriller. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven and stars Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. Douglas plays a San Francisco police detective who investigates the murder of a rich rock star. During this investigation he gets personally involved with the prime suspect, Catherine Tramell (played by Stone). The movie generated a lot of controversy due to its strong and graphic violence. It was strongly opposed by gay rights activists for its portrayal of a bisexual woman as a narcissistic psychopath. The movie was given mixed reviews, but it took in millions at the box office. It was originally under a rating of NC-17. It was later edited down for an R rating before release.

It was followed by a sequel, "Basic Instinct 2".
