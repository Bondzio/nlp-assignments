Milan Kundera

Milan Kundera (April 1 1929) is a writer who was born in Czechoslovakia and writes mainly in the Czech and French languages. He is best known as the writer of "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", "The Book of Laughter and Forgetting", and "Identity". The sale of his books in his home country was forbidden until the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989. Kundera has lived in France since 1975.

A number of Kundera's novels appear to criticise totalitarianism and the impact of totalitarianism on art.
