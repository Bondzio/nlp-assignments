Government of India Act 1935

The Government of India Act 1935 was the last constitution of British India. It lasted until 1947, when British India was split into Pakistan and India.

The act


Despite the failure of round table conferences, in March 1933 the British government announced its proposals for how India should be governed. These were published in a 'white paper'(a discussion issued before a Bill is presented to the British parliament). After discussions by the British politicians and consultation with Indian delegates, nominated by the government to take part in the talks, a Bill was introduced before the British parliament in December 1934. In August 1935, the Government of India act became law. This was the last major legislation that the British government passed before independence was granted. The act was an important point in the move towards independence. It provided the basis for negotiations which resulted the British leaving India.
This act was opposed by both the Muslim League and Congress however both contested in the elections of 1937.
