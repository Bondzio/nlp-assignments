Supreme Governor of the Church of England

The Supreme Governor of the Church of England is a title which British Monarchs have to show their leadership over the Church of England. The title was first granted to King Henry VIII after he passed the Act of Supremacy, which required all officials in the Church of England to state an oath of allegiance to him.
