Lisa Gerrard

Lisa Gerrard (born April 12, 1961) is an Australian musician, singer and composer who rose to fame as part of the group Dead Can Dance with former music partner Brendan Perry. 

Gerrard received a Golden Globe award and an Academy Award nomination for the score for the 2000 film "Gladiator" on which she teamed up with Hans Zimmer.

Gerrard possesses the vocal range of a contralto, spanning from E3-F5. Her voice has been described as rich, deep, dark, mournful and unique. 

She also has the ability to extend upwards into the dramatic mezzo-soprano range, examples of such would be on the songs "The Host of Seraphim", "Elegy", "Space Weaver", "Come This Way" and "One Perfect Sunrise". Gerrard however performs more predominantly in the dramatic contralto range in her other songs, "Sanvean", "Sacrifice", "Largo" and "Not Yet". 

Gerrard sings many of her songs, such as "Now We Are Free", "Come Tenderness", "Serenity", "The Valley of the Moon", "Tempest", "Pilgrimage of Lost Children", "Coming Home" and "Sanvean" in an idioglossia (an idiosyncratic language) that she has developed since the age of twelve.
