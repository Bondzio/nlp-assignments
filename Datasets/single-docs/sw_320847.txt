Tajima Province

The province had borders with Harima, Inaba, Tamba, and Tango provinces.

The ancient provincial capital city was near Hidaka. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Tajima Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Izushi jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Tajima.
