Henry Lefroy

Sir Henry Bruce Lefroy (24 March 1854 â€“ 19 March 1930) was the 11th Premier of Western Australia from 28 June 1917 to 17 April 1919. He was from the Nationalist Party. He became premier after the Australian Labor Party split over the issue of conscription. Labor politicians led by John Scaddan agreed to join the Nationalist Party if Lefory was the leader, not Frank Wilson. He found it diificult to keep control over a government formed by different political parties. When it was discovered that he had used his casting vote in a Cabinet meeting to keep the leadership, he was forced to resign. He lost his seat in the 1921 elections and retired back to his farm.
