Bicep curl

A number of similar exercises are called "bicep curls". These are designed to use the muscles on the top of the arm. 

Most of the time a person is seated or standing and a weight is held in the hand. The elbow is then bent to make the hand come to the shoulder. 

The different kinds of bicep curls mostly change the way the wrist is positioned.
