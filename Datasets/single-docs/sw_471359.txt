Long-handled bulb planter

A long-handled bulb planter is a gardening tool. It is used to dig holes to plant bulbs and other plants. It is also used to put soil back in the holes in order to cover the bulbs. A long-handled bulb planter allows people not to bend when using them.

In addition to bulbs, this tool can be used to help plant other plants which need a similar hole size and depth. For example, it can be used for planting potatoes.
