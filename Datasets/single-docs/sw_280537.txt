Welcome to Paradise

Welcome to Paradise is a song by rock band Green Day. It first appeared on their second album "Kerplunk". But a new version appeared on the album "Dookie".

The song is about the urban life of people in West Oakland and it's based on the band members lives in a rundown warehouse in West Oakland.

The song was written by Billie Joe Armstrong.

The music video shows Billie Joe (Green Day's singer) playing a West Oakland citizen who watches a dangerous notoriety caused by a group of thugs then he goes home to watch the citizens and what they do each day.

The "Kerplunk" version has a slower sound and the "Dookie" version is more fast paced and also both versions have slightly different lyrics. The original version of the song from "Kerplunk" was not a single but the "Dookie" version was.

The album cover for "Dookie" in fact, shows a comedic depiction of chaos happening in West Oakland.

In the booklet for the "Dookie" album a cartoonish drawing in West Oakland is shown.
