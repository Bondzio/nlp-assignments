Hawker

A hawker is a person who sells things that can be easily moved from place to place. They are also known as peddlers, costermongers, or street vendors. Hawkers often sell food. They attract attention by calling out, singing chants, and interacting loudly with customers. While hawkers can be found in markets, they often move their products from place to place in small carts. In 19th century Australia, the hawkers travelled around to distant towns and remote farms, carrying a large range of items to sell in horse drawn wagons.
