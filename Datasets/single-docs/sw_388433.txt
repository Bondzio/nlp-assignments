Opel Antara

The Opel Antara is a compact CUV from the General Motors' German automaker Opel since 2006. The Antara replaced the Opel Frontera a badge engineered version of the compact Isuzu Rodeo SUV. It was sold as the second generation Saturn Vue, as a fleet-only Chevrolet Captiva Sport in America, and as a Vauxhall model in the UK. The Vue was discontinued after Saturn went out of business. The Captiva Sport was discontinued upon the introduction of the Trax. The Antara is expected to be replaced with a rebadged Buick Envision and sold as Opel Antara B.
