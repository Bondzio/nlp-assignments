A Boy Like That

"A Boy Like That" is a popular Broadway song. "A Boy Like That" (originally "A Boy Like That/I Have A Love") was written by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim for the musical play, "The West Side Story" (1957). The song was performed by Chita Rivera (Anita) and Carol Lawrence (Maria). In the 1960 movie version the roles were played by Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood, but the songs were dubbed by Betty Wand and Marni Nixon (as both Anita and Maria). 

In 1995, after attending the Grammy Awards, Selena was asked to participate in the AIDS Project Los Angeles. She accepted because she had loved to do charity work and give back to her community, for which she was famous for being "down-to-Earth". Selena recorded the song as a rhythm and blues, funk song. It was released after Selena was murdered for the various artists album in 1997.
