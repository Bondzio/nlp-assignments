Pinwheel galaxy

The Pinwheel galaxy (Messier 101, M101 or NGC 5457) is a face-on spiral galaxy in the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.

The galaxy is 21 million light-years (six megaparsecs) away from us. It was first discovered by Pierre MÃ©chain on 27 March 1781. Charles Messier verified its position and included it in the "Messier Catalogue" as one of the last entries.

In 2006, NASA and the ESA released a very detailed image of the Pinwheel Galaxy, which was the largest and most detailed image of a galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope at the time. The image was composed from 51 individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.

On 24 August 2011, a Type Ia supernova, SN 2011fe, was discovered in M101.

A remarkable property of this galaxy is its huge and extremely bright H II regions, of which about 3,000 can be seen on photographs. H II regions have numbers of short-lived blue stars formed from clouds of high density molecular hydrogen. These regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light that ionizes the surrounding gas. 

The galaxy contains ULX-1 (an ultra-luminous X-ray source), which is a relatively small black hole, just 20 to 30 times the mass of our Sun.
