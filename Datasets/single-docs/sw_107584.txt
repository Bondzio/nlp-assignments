King Power Stadium

The King Power Stadium is a football stadium in Leicester, England, where Leicester City Football Club play their home football matches. Built to replace the aging filbert street ground, it can have up to 32,500 people inside it, more than 10,000 more than the ground it replaced. Originally called the Walkers Stadium, it was renamed to the King Power Stadium in 2011 following the end of the sponsorship deal, and re-branded the King Power Stadium following a take over by the current club owners and consultation with fans.
