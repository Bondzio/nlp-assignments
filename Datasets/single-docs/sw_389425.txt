Baconator

The Baconator is a sandwich made by Wendy's restaurants. It has two beef patties, two slices of American cheese, six strips of bacon, mayonnaise, and ketchup on a bun. It was introduced in April 2007. In 2009, Wendy's started offering two other versions of the Baconator: the Baconator Single (one patty) and the Baconator Triple (three patties). The original version is now called the Baconator Double.
