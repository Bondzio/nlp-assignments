The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause

The Santa Claus 3: The Escape Clause is the third movie in "The Santa Clause" series of movies.

 The Santa Claus 3: The Escape Clause is a 2006 American Christmas fantasy comedy adventure film directed by Michael Lembeck. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film of all time, "Citizen Kane" was voted as such in five consecutive British Film Institute "Sight & Sound" polls of critics, until it was displaced by "Vertigo" in the 2012 poll. It topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 2017, as well as its 2007 update. "Citizen Kane" is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.
