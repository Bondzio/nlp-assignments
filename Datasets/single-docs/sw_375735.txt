Spacetime metric

In special relativity, the spacetime metric, also called the Minkowski metric', is the metric tensor that describes the line element in Minkowski spacetime. 

The metric can be described by the following line element:

formula_1

In units where the speed of light, formula_2, is one, then the metric in matrix form is

formula_3
