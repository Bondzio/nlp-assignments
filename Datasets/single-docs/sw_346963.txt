Anting

Anting is a behavior in which birds rub insects (usually ants) on their feathers. This removes liquids with chemicals such as formic acid. Instead of ants, birds can also use millipedes. Over 250 species of bird have been known to ant.

There are two forms of anting: active anting and passive acting. Active anting is when a bird picks up ants in its bill and wipes them on its feathers. Passive anting is when the bird lies down in a group of ants and opens up its wings so that the ants will crawl up into its feathers.
