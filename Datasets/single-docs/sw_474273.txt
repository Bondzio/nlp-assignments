Dementia with Lewy bodies

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), also known under a variety of other names including Lewy body dementia (LBD), diffuse Lewy body disease, cortical Lewy body disease, and senile dementia of Lewy type, is a type of dementia closely related with Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, parts of alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin protein in neurons, detectable in "post mortem" brain histology.
Lewy body dementia affects 1.3 million individuals in the United States alone.
