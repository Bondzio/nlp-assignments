Marco Rubio presidential campaign, 2016

The 2016 presidential campaign of Marco Rubio, the junior United States Senator from Florida, and former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, was formally announced on April 13, 2015, at an event at the Freedom Tower in Downtown Miami. 

Having been considered a potential candidate for Vice President by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, Rubio has been seen as a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016 since at least the end of the 2012 election. He suspended his campaign on March 15, 2016.

On March 30, 2015 Rubio announced on Fox News and through social media that he would be making a "Big Announcement" on April 13 in Miami, Florida. While he did not specify whether the announcement pertained to his reelection as a United States Senator or for the Presidency, most media consensus was that Rubio would be announcing his presidential run. He made the announcement at the Freedom Tower in Downtown Miami.

Rubio raised about $1.25 million online the day after his announcement. By the three-month mark of his campaign - July 13 - Rubio had raised over $12 million.
