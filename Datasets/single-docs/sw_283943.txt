Inclusive education

Inclusive education is an idea in the field of education. It means that persons with disabilities or persons who need special care can learn in schools together with people who do not have special needs. This idea comes from the idea of social justice, which demands that all people have human rights without any discriminations. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also says that access to education is a right. However, inclusive education may make special aid, care or knowledge for persons with disabilities difficult if enough reasonable accommodation are not given.
