Kyrgyzstani parliamentary election, 2015

The 2015 Kyrgyzstani parliamentary election was held on 4 October 2015.

The 120 seats in the Supreme Council were elected by proportional representation. This means that if a party gets 20% of the vote, for example, they get 20% of the seats. A party had to receive at least 7% of the vote to get seats in the council. No party was allowed to win more than 65 seats. 

Many political parties were formed before the election; often made by wealthy Kyrgyz who want to promote their own interests.

A lot of potential candidates were not allowed to run due to criminal convictions. One party leader, a former boxer, was banned after he beat up a rival candidate.

Even though there were some reports of voter fraud, the OSCE said that the elections were "lively and competitive" and "unique in this region." The PACE said that voters had "made their choice freely among a large number of contestants."

The OSCE did note some problems with voter registration, and the Council of Europe had concern over the transparency of some campaigns and financing.
