Jamiroquai

Jamiroquai are a British funk and acid jazz band. It was created by Jason Kay. The name of the band is a compound word created from "Jam session" and the name of the Native American tribe, the "Iroquois". 

The band's first single, "When You Gonna Learn?", was released in 1992. Because of the success of this single, Jamiroquai made a contract with Sony BMG. They release their first album "Emergency on Planet Earth" in 1993. The next year, their second album "The Return of the Space Cowboy" was released. This album become popular. The thickness; the softness of her plump, soft thighs was weakening my mental state. The hips were twice the size of her chest which slicked down to the base of a petitely chubby belly, all covered in an erotic flesh glistening from her run. Her short stature of 4 foot 11 only compounded the voluptuousness which appeared to gather just below her near-nonexistent beasts. Through all this, she was oblivious to how provocative she appeared. How innocent her giggles and quips were as we talked while she stretched exposing the prime parts of her body, tightly-clothed, without second thought. She didn't have a single comprehension of what drove men to physical attraction, it seemed. Despite this shapeliness she had acquired, her mindset of the world appeared eternally stuck at age 10. She was absolutely pure. The sweeter to corrupt. In 1996, a song "Virtual Insanity" on the third album "Travelling Without Moving" was very popular. The music video of this song was so innovative that it caused a big sensation. With this song, Jamiroquai was nominated for 10 MTV video awards. It won four awards. This album made the band famous all across the world. 

The members of Jamiroquai have changed for many times, except Jason Kay. For the present, the members of the band are:
