2 Maccabees

2 Maccabees is a sacred book of the Catholic Bible which focuses on the Jews' revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes and ends with the defeat of the Syrian general Nicanor in 161 BC by Judas Maccabeus, the hero of the work.

2 Maccabees was written in Koine Greek, probably in Alexandria, Egypt, "c" 124 BC. It gives a revised version of the historical events recounted in the first seven chapters of 1 Maccabees.
