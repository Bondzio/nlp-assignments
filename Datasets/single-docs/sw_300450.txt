Superstars (TV program)

Superstars is TV program. The show is a sports competition between very good athletes from different sports. They try to win a series of athletic events similar to a decathlon. Figure skating champion Dick Button developed the idea. ABC bought it as a special for the winter of 1973. The first "Superstars" competition was held in Rotonda West, Florida in March 1973. The winner was pole vaulter Bob Seagren. The BBC covered the competition and aired their own programme on December 31, 1973. The BBC version featured British athletes.

Competitors usually participate in ten different sporting events, including a 100-yard dash, run, obstacle course, weightlifting, bowling, rowing, tennis, basketball, bicycle racing, and swimming. Sometimes the sports have changed over time and between the European and American competitions. For example, in the first USA competition, there was no obstacle course, but there was table tennis and baseball. Athletes get points for the position they finish in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is the winner.
