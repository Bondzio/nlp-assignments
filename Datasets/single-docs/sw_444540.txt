Maize weevil

The maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) is a species of beetle in the family Curculionidae. In the United States, it is called the greater rice weevil. It lives in many tropical areas around the world, and in the United States. It is a major pest of maize. This species attacks both crops that are still growing and those that have been harvested. It attacks wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed. The maize weevil also attacks processed cereal products such as pasta, cassava, and various coarse, milled grains. It has even been known to attack fruit while in storage, such as apples.
