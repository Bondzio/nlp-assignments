Tonight Is the Night (song)

"Tonight Is the Night" is the debut single by the rapper and singer Outasight. It was released by Warner Bros. in 2011. The song was played on the FOX network program "The X Factor." It was played during the week 2 "results" episode on November 3, 2011. A music video of the song was released. It was directed by Dori Oskowitz.

The song has been used in Pepsi's "Who's Next" ad campaign. The ad shows an young singer drinking from a Pepsi can while getting ready for his performance. While "Tonight Is the Night" is being played, very well known singers appear. These include Michael Jackson, Alfonso Ribeiro, Ray Charles, Britney Spears, Kanye West, and Mariah Carey. The last shot of the ad goes back to the young singer while the slogan "who's next?" is put on the screen. The ad ends with the catch phrase: "Where there's Pepsi, there's music".
