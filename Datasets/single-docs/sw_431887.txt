Prince du sang

A prince du sang (prince of the blood) was a member of the extended French Royal Family. This meant that all people except females that were princes of the blood would be entitled to inherit the throne only if every male member of the immediate royal family had died. The main princes of the blood were known as the Prince of Conti and the Prince of Condé as well as the more significant Duke of Orléans. The prince of the blood was entitled to be styled Serene Highness () but it was used in writing only. A majority of the princes of the blood had their own apartments at the Palace of Versailles as well as their own townhouses in Paris
