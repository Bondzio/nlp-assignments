Common year starting on Monday

This is the calendar for any common year starting on Monday, January 1 (dominical letter G). The most recent year of this type was 2007 and the next one will be 2018 in the Gregorian calendar,
or 2013 and 2019 in the Julian calendar. The exceptional common year, 1900 was also a common year starting on Monday in the Gregorian calendar. (See tables at bottom.)

A common year is a year with 365 days; in other words, not a leap year.
