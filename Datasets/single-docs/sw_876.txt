United States customary units

U.S customary units is the system of units of measurement used to measure things in the United States. The system of Imperial units is similar and in some parts identical.

Length or distance units include the inch, foot, yard and mile.

Land units include square miles (2589998.47032 square meter) and acres (4046.8726 square meter).

Common volume units are the teaspoon, tablespoon (3 teaspoons), fluid ounce (two tablespoons), cup (8 ounces), pint (2 cups, or 16 fluid ounces), quart (2 pints, or 32 fluid ounces), US gallon (16 cups, 128 fluid ounces, or 3.8 liters).

A barrel is the unit to measure oil.

Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F). To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: take the Celsius, multiply by nine, divide by five, and add thirty-two.

Units of weight include the pound (453.6 grams), which contains 16 ounces. This should not be confused with the British pound which is a type of money. The different uses of the word "pound" can cause confusion.

Some people have been trying change these units in favour of the metric system since the 1820s. Much infrastructure was built in past centuries using the old measures by both British and Americans. During the 20th century some segments such as science, medicine and the military of the United States converted to the metric system but the old units are still used for daily purposes by Americans. On the other hand, world trade is conducted using the metric system and except for the U.S., the world uses the metric system for all purposes.
