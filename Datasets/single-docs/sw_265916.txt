2010 Commonwealth Games

The 2010 Commonwealth Games is the nineteenth Commonwealth Games, and the ninth to be held under that name. The Games are being held in New Delhi, India from 3 to 14 October 2010, the largest multi-sport event conducted to date in Delhi and India, which has previously hosted the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. The opening ceremony took place at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event. It is also the first time the Commonwealth Games is held in India and the second time the event has been held in Asia (after 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia).

While allegations of delays and corruption were a cause of concern before the start of the games, the games generally ran smoothly and the opening ceremony was described as "spectacular".
