Paleoconservatism

Paleoconservatism (sometimes called paleocon) is a conservative idea that stresses tradition, limited government and civil society, along with religious, national and Western identity. The idea is mainly found in the United States.

According to scholar Michael Foley, paleoconservatives want more restrictions on immigration, cuts in multicultural programs, protectionism (basically meaning that foreign goods will be taxed more), isolationism, and to bring back traditional societal roles.

Paul Gottfried created the term in the 1980s. It was used to refer to conservative traditional Catholics and agrarian Southerners who turned against Communism during the Cold War.
