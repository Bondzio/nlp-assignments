Harlequin (color)

Harlequin is the name of the color that is halfway between green and chartreuse green on the color wheel. On color plate 17 in the 1930 book "A Dictionary of Color", the color "harlequin" is shown as being on the color wheel precisely halfway between "green" and "yellow-green" (the color which was formerly called "yellow-green" is now called "chartreuse green"). 

The first recorded use of "harlequin" as a color name in English was in 1923.
