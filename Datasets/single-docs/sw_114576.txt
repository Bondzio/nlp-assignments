Bohemian Rhapsody

Bohemian Rhapsody is a song by English rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury, and was released on their 1975 album "A Night at the Opera". 

While, at first, record companies believed the song would not receive radio airplay due to its length (5 minutes and 55 seconds) and its difference to other songs of the time, it became #1 on many charts. It is now played on the radio in full-length.
