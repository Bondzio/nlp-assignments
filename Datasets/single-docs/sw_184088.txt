Crowded House

Crowded House are a New Zealand rock group. They formed in 1985 in Melbourne, by Neil Finn, after the original Split Enz disbanded, led by New Zealand singer-songwriter brothers Tim and Neil Finn, from Te Awamutu in New Zealands North Island. Both brothers came from a rural NZ farming background. They evolved from the original Split Enz group formed by Tim and Neil Finn. Neil Finn is the main songwriter and creative director of the band and founder of Crowded House. Tim Finn pursued a successful solo career. The brothers still perform together from time to time.. The band had a few members from different countries: but remains one of New Zealands most successful rock bands including Split Enz and the original Finn brothers. .

Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band has had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, "Crowded House", which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits, "Don't Dream It's Over" and "Something So Strong". Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, "Woodface" and "Together Alone" and the compilation album "Recurring Dream", which included the hits "Fall at Your Feet", "Weather with You", "Distant Sun", "Locked Out", "Instinct" and "Not the Girl You Think You Are".

Founding drummer Hester left in May 1994, citing family reasons, but returned for their "Farewell to the World" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Neil Finn had decided to end the band to concentrate on his solo career and the Finn Brothers project with Tim. On 26 March 2005 Hester committed suicide, aged 46.

In 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod. They have since released two albums, which have both reached number one on Australia's Album Chart. The new albums are called "Time on Earth" (2007) and "Intriguer" (2010).
