My Kind of Town

""My Kind of Town" or "My Kind of Town (Chicago Is)""' is a popular song composed by Jimmy Van Heusen, with lyrics by Sammy Cahn. It was originally part of the musical score for "Robin and the 7 Hoods", a 1964 musical film starring several members of the Rat Pack. It was nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to "Chim Chim Cher-ee" from "Mary Poppins". Frank Sinatra recorded several versions which have appeared on many of his albums.
