Sexless marriage

A sexless marriage is a marriage in which the partners do not have sex very often or at all. The U.S. National Health and Social Life Survey in 1994 (Laumann et al. 1994) found that 2 percent of the married people who answered said they did not have sex in the past year. The definition of a sexless marriage is often broadened, to include marriages where sex occurs less than ten times per year. Using this definition, 20 percent of the couples in the National Health and Social Life Survey would be in the category. "Newsweek" magazine says that 15 to 20 percent of couples in the U.S. are in a sexless relationship.
