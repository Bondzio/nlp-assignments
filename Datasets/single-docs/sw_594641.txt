Monte dei Paschi di Siena

Banca Monte dei paschi di Siena (sometimes referred to as BMPS or MPS) claims to be the oldest surviving retail bank in the world. It has its headquarters in Siena, Italy.

The company's website claims that the bank was founded in the year 1472 , although there is little to confirm this.
