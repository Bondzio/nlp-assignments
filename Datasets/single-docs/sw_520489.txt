Frederick Muhlenberg

Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg (; January 1, 1750 â€“ June 4, 1801) was an American minister and politician. 

He was the first Speaker of the United States House of Representatives serving from 1793 through 1795. He was a delegate to the Pennsylvania state constitutional convention and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and a Lutheran pastor by profession. Muhlenberg was born in Trappe, Pennsylvania. 

The claim that Muhlenberg, as House Speaker, prevented German from becoming an official language of the United States is false.
