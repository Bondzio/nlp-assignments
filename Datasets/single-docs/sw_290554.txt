The All-American Rejects first became a band in 1999 when band member Tyson Ritter and Nick Wheeler were in high school. The name All-American Reject was made from either a mix of two suggestions, "The Rejects" and "The All Americans" or the other being that it came from a song "Reject" by Green Day and had the chorus, "a reject, all american".
