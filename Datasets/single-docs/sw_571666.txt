Live at Leeds

Live at Leeds is a live album by The Who. It was recorded at Leeds University on 14 February 1970. At the time of the recording The Who were in the prime of their career and were widely hailed as the greatest live band that had ever played. They were said to be quite tight that night. The original album consisted of six songs. In 1995, an extended remaster was made, and later a deluxe edition and a 4-CD set. Live at Leeds consistently holds the top spot on critics' lists of the greatest live albums of all time.
