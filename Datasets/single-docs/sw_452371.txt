Arc of the United States

The Arc of the United States is a network of non-profit organizations which serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It was created in the 1950s by parents of people with disabilities. Since then, the organization has extended to almost 40 states.

The ARC was called the National Association of Retarded Children (1953-1973), National Association of Retarded Citizens (1973-1981) and later the Association of Retarded Citizens of the United States (1981-1992). Since 1992, it has been called just The Arc.
