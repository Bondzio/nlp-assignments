Le Plateau-Mont-Royal

The plateau is a neighborhood in Montreal just northeast of downtown. Originally it was a middle class neighborhood containing large Québécois, Portuguese and Jewish population. In the 1980s, many artists moved into the plateau attracted by low rent and the beautiful architecture. Today the plateau is a very expensive area to live in with many attractive shops and restaurants. The neighborhood maintains an old world charm with its beautiful architecture. It is certainly one of the most beautiful places in Montreal.
