Bloody Sunday (1905)

Bloody Sunday took place in Russia in 1905. More than 3,000 people marched towards the Winter Palace to Tsar Nicholas II to show him a petition for reform. But he was not home that day. When he heard about the petition, he became worried (his family had a history of being assassinated) and so the army shot their rifles into the crowd, leaving more than 100 dead and 300 wounded. This evident has caused the Russian Revolution.

Later Dmitri Shostakovich composed his 11th Symphony based on this event.
