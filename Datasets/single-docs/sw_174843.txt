Stitch! The Movie

Stitch! The Movie is a direct-to-video animated spin-off of "Lilo & Stitch", released on August 26, 2003. It is often considered more of a pilot for the spinoff series "" rather than a sequel to the original movie. The movie introduces Jumba's 625 experiments. Without the credits, the movie is only 57 minutes long.

Stitch, Jumba, and Peakley are all living with Lilo and Nani. But no one knows that Jumba had secretly deactivated all 625 of is other expiriments and brought them with him. The ex-captain Gantu, hired by Jumba's former partner, Dr. Jacques von Hamsterveil, goes to find them, and captures Jumba to force him into telling where they are. Now, Lilo and Stitch have to save Stitch's ohana from being used for chaos. Two expiriemnts are activated in this movie: 221, "Sparky", with the ability to cause big electric surges, and 625 who has all the abilities of Stitch, but is lasier. At least he makes good sandwiches!

The movie's original title was going to be "Lilo & Stitch: A New Ohana". At some time, there was a decision to only have Stitch's name in the names of both the movie and the following series, which was planned to be called "Stitch! The Series". Eventually, this was changed, making this movie and the series have different names.
