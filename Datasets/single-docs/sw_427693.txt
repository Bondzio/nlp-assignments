Transit bus

Transit buses (also city buses, town buses or public buses) are public transport vehicles that are used for short and moderate distances for transporting people within that metro region or city. Public transit buses often use large or multiple exit and entry doors for conveniences of boarding and exiting, minimal to moderate (sometimes no) luggage spaces, multimedia machines and air conditioner/heating for passengers and drivers. Pull chains or cords are also used on public buses. Fares are usually paid with cash, tickets or certain credit/debit cards. Many people prefer using public buses instead of driving their own automobile for many reasons (unable to drive or not wanting to drive).
