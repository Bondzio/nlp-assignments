CBGB

CBGB was a New York City music nightclub. The letters "CBGB" stand for "country, bluegrass, blues". The club was opened in 1973 by Hilly Kristal. CBGB, soon afterward, became a place where new wave and punk rock bands played. These included Patti Smith Group, Blondie and Talking Heads. From the early 1980s onward, CBGB was known for hardcore punk.

One store next to CBGB became the "CBGB Record Canteen", a record shop and caf√©. In the late 1980s, CBGB Record Canteen was changed into an art gallery and second performance space. The name was "CB's 313 Gallery." CB's Gallery was played by artists of milder sounds, such as acoustic rock, folk, jazz or experimental music. On the other side, CBGB had a small cafe and bar in the mid 1990s. The cafe served classic New York pizza.

In October 2006, the original CBGB closed after its final concert. The concert was by Patti Smith. CBGB Radio started on the iHeartRadio platform in 2010. In 2013, its previous building, 315 Bowery, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Bowery Historic District.
