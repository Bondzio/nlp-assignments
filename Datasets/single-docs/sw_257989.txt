Flag of New Mexico

The Flag of the State of New Mexico has the red sun symbol of the zia in the middle and has a yellow background. 

In 1920, Dr. Harry Mera, an archaeologist won a contest to design a new state flag and chose the Zia sun symbol because he was familiar with the one that was found in Zia Pueblo on a 19th century pot. There is four because four is a sacred number to the Zia which symbolizes the Circle of Life: four winds, four seasons, four directions, and four sacred obligations. New Mexico was the 48th state and it was founded in 1912.
