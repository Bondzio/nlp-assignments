Sengoku period

The name "Sengoku" was adopted by Japanese historians. The Sengoku period in Japan mirrors the Warring States period in Chinese history.

The Sengoku period would precede a process of unification and the end of Japan's medieval period.

Three important and powerful daimyo were Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. These three leaders did the most to bring Japan together as one country. Other important leaders include Date Masamune and Akechi Mitsuhide.
