Thor

Thor is the red-haired and bearded god of thunder in Norse mythology. He is the son of Odin and Jörð. The ancient Norse believed that during Ragnarök, Thor would kill and be killed by Jörmungandr.

Thor was one of the most amazingly powerful Norse gods. He was well known for his fights with the race of giants. He was said to protect Asgard (the home of the god)

Thor was believed to be the son of Odin (Wotan or Woden) and the giantess Jörd (Jörd, the Earth). His wife is called Sif. With his mistress, the giantess Járnsaxa, Thor had his sons Magni and Modi, and with Sif he had his daughter Thrud. Thor also had a stepson called Ull who was a son of Sif.

Thor was said to travel in a chariot drawn by goats. He would slay the goats every evening to feast and they would reappear the next day.

According to writings known as sagas, Thor owned a short-handled war hammer, Mjolnir. When the hammer was thrown, it returned magically to the owner. Thor also used it to cause thunderclaps. With the hammer, Thor performed his giant-killing duties. In the English calendar, the day 'Thursday' is named after Thor.

Thor is a character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is god of thunder and a member of the "Avengers". Loki is his supposed younger adopted brother. Sif is not his wife, but his friend. In the movie "The Avengers", Chris Hemsworth plays the role of Thor. A protector of the human race who prefers the Midgard to Asgard.
