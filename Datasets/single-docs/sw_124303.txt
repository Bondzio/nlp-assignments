Pedagogy

Pedagogy is the art or science of being a teacher.
The word pedagogy comes from the Greek word "paidagōgeō", which means "to lead the child." In Ancient Greece, it was usually a slave who helped his master's son get an education. The slave would bring the master's son to school and carry his school things for him, such as a musical instrument.

An academic degree is sometimes given for pedagogy. In the United States of America and Great Britain, you can earn a degree in education at the Bachelor's (undergraduate; BA or BS) or Master's (graduate; MA or MS) level. You can also earn an advanced degree called either a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), or a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.); you can also get a degree for specific things, like a Doctor of Music degree in piano pedagogy.

Some people do not like the idea of pedagogy. They say that learning is something that a person does for themselves, not something that a person imposes on a person. Pedagogy is mainly credited and acknowledged in Western society, but not regarded as a good thing in some Eastern secular and fundamentalist societies.
