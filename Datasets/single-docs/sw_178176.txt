Ischaemia

In medicine, ischaemia is when the blood supply is blocked or restricted. This is usually caused by problems in the blood vessels, and causes damage to the body. It may also be spelled ischemia or isch√¶mia. It comes from the Greek words, "isch-" to "restrict" and "hema" or "haema" meaning "blood".
