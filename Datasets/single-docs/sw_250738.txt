StarHub TV

StarHub TV is a cable television service in Singapore. It is owned by StarHub Limited.

The cable network has been operating since 1991. It was then operated by Singapore Cable Vision (SCV). By 1996, SCV had built a S$600 million broadband cable network across the country. In 2002, SCV merged with StarHub, and was renamed StarHub Cable Vision. In 2007, StarHub Cable Television was rebranded as StarHub TV.

It is the only cable television service in Singapore. It was previously also the only pay television service in the country until 2007, when mio TV was launched.
