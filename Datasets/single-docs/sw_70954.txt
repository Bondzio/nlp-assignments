Basilisk

Basilisks are a type of lizard. They are about 70-75 cm long, when fully grown, and weigh about 80 grams. They can be found in South America. Currently, there are four different species. They can be very still and hard to see.

The basilisk lizard can walk on water. It runs across the surface of a pond or pool, without sinking. Its speed keeps it from sinking. At the same time, its long tail helps it to balance.
