Plastic explosive

A Plastic exlplosive is an explosive that can be formed freely, and that can take almost any form. In 1898, Georg Friedrich Henning developed the substance that is known as RDX or T4 today, but which he called "Hexogen". This substance is also part of Composite Compound 4 (or C4), which was developed in the 1960s.
