Pōhutukawa

The Pōhutukawa is a New Zealand native tree which grows mainly on the coast of the North Island. It is evergreen and has bright red flowers. These flowers appear between November and January, during the Southern hemisphere summer. Because it is red and green during Christmas, it is often called the New Zealand Christmas tree.

The Pōhutukawa is endangered, meaning that there are not many left. This is because possums eat the leaves of the trees, killing them. Project Crimson is a group trying to stop this happening.
