Nightshade

The nightshades (Solanaceae) are a family of plants. All of them bear flowers. Many members of the family are edible, but some are poisonous. Very often, only certain parts of the plant are edible or poisonous. Well-known members of this family are chili peppers, petunias, deadly nightshade, mandrakes, potatoes, tomatoes, aubergines (eggplants) and tobacco.

Because it is thought that nightshades can cause or increase swelling and pain, many people do not eat them.
