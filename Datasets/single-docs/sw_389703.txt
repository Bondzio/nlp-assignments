Perseus Arm

The Perseus Arm is one of two major spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. The second major arm is called the Scutum–Centaurus Arm.

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms and a number of minor arms or spurs. The Perseus Spiral Arm, with a radius of about 10,700 parsecs, is between the minor Cygnus and Carina–Sagittarius Arms. It is so named because it is seen in the same direction as the constellation Perseus.

The Perseus Spiral arm contains a number of Messier objects:
