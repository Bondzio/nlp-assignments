Bell MTS Place

Bell MTS Place, originally known as True North Centre and later as MTS Centre, is a sports arena in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The arena opened on November 16, 2004, and is the current home to the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena was originally known as True North Centre during planning but naming rights were bought by Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS). After Bell Canada purchased MTS in spring 2017, the arena was renamed effective that May 30.

The arena was home to the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL) from 2004 to 2011.
