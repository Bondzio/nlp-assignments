Emperor Yūryaku

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

According to the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki", Yūryaku was the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingyō.

He was the brother of Emperor Ankō.

Yūryaku was followed on the throne by his son, who would come to be known as Emperor Seinei.

Very little is known about the events of Yūryaku's life and rule. Only limited facts can be studied before the rule of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.

After Ankō's death, Yūryaku overcame others in the struggle for power. He became the new emperor.

Yūryaku is known as a patron of silk. It is said that he encouraged growing mulberry bushes for silkworms to eat.

Poems that are said to be Yūryaku's are included in the "Manyōshū". A number of his verses are kept in the "Kojiki" and the "Nihonshoki."

He is credited with bringing many artisans from Korea to Japan.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Yūryaku.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
