Big Sky Conference

The Big Sky Conference is a NCAA conference that play in the NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Ogden, Utah and features universities and colleges from the Western United States, plus one in the Midwestern U.S. In football, the league plays in the second-level Division I FCS.

As of the 2017â€“18 school year, the Big Sky has 12 full members, or schools that play almost all of their sports in the conference. Of these schools, only Idaho does not play football in the conference. Its team in that sport plays in the top-level Division I FBS as a single-sport member of the Sun Belt Conference.

After the full Sun Belt members decided not to renew their football membership contract with Idaho when it expired after the 2017 season, Idaho decided to downgrade its football program to the FCS level and return to Big Sky football in 2018.

North Dakota will leave the non-football side of the Big Sky to join the Summit League, home to many of its traditional rivals, in 2018. The school's football team will stay in the Big Sky until 2020, when it will join the Missouri Valley Football Conference.

The Big Sky has four "associate" members that play only one sport in the conference.
