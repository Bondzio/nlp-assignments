Big 12 Conference

The Big 12 Conference is a college athletic conference that is part of the NCAA's Division I. It started when the Big 8 Conference joined together with four colleges from Texas that had been part of the Southwest Conference, and the first games in the Big 12 Conference were played in 1996.

The Big 12 also has 10 "associate members", all of which play one sport in the conference.
Four schools have left the Big 12 since it was formed.
