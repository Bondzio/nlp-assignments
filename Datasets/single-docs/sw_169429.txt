Jacqui Katona

Jacqui Katona is an Aboriginal woman who tried to stop the Jabiluka uranium mine in the Northern Territory. In 1998 the Mirrar Aboriginal people, together with environmental groups, created one of the largest protests in Australia's history. Katona won the 1999 U.S. Goldman Environmental Prize because she protected her country and culture against uranium mining.
