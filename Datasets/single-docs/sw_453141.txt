Turner syndrome

Turner syndrome, also known as 45 X, is a genetic disorder of human females. It is usually caused by the loss of one of the X chromosomes.

Turner's syndrome occurs in 1 out of 2000, to 1 out of 5000 female births. The condition is much more common "in utero" (that is, before birth). About 1–2% of all conceptions are affected, of which only 1% survive to birth.

Girls with Turner syndrome often have webbed necks, short stature, broad chests and low hairlines. Heart disease, hypothyroidism (reduced hormone secretion by the thyroid), and diabetes are other problems that may be present. Autoimmune diseases and infertility may also occur. These girls usually have normal intelligence but may have some trouble with vision and hearing.

Girls with Turner Syndrome sometimes receive Human Growth Hormone (hGH). Human Growth Hormone regulates growth in the human body. Human Growth Hormone helps girls with Turner Syndrome grow normally.

Many girls affected by Turner’s syndrome also may experience learning disabilities. These are usually related to subjects that are not related to verbal subjects. A girl’s visual or motor coordination may be impaired, and she may have trouble with her spatial perception as well.
