The Game (mind game)

The Game is the name of a mind game. The goal is not to think about The Game itself. If someone thinks about The Game, they lose. If someone loses, they must tell someone, or announce that they "lost The Game."

No one is sure how The Game started. A similar game was played by Leo Tolstoy in 1840. The media has reported on The Game in many countries and has guessed the number of players to be in the millions.

There are three rules to The Game:

Some people have claimed that the game ends when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom says on television that "The Game is up." However, not everyone believes this. Most people say that The Game will never end. They say that the game cannot be won. Nevertheless, an xkcd comic reads: "You just won The Game. You're free!"
