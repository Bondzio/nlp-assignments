Trans-Pacific Partnership

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed free trade agreement drafted 5 October 2015 between several Pacific Rim countries. It is about many different matters of economic policy. Among other things, the TPP seeks to lower trade barriers such as tariffs, establish a common framework for intellectual property, enforce standards for labour law and environmental law, and establish an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.
