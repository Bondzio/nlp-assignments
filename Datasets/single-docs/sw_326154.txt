Mitsubishi A7M

The Mitsubishi A7M ReppÅ« (Japanese for "Strong Gale") was a fighter aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Navy. It was made to be a successor to the A6M Zero. It was designed to get superior speed, agility, and weaponry over the Zero. The wing area and overall size were also greater, about the same as the American P-47 Thunderbolt. The A7M's allied codename was "Sam".
