Ram Dass

Dr. Richard Alpert (born April 6, 1931), also known as Baba Ram Dass, is a spiritual teacher. He is the writer of "Be Here Now", the bestseller book of 1971.

In the 1960s, professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert collaborated on a book titled "The Psychedelic Experience", which adapted portions of the "Tibetan Book of the Dead" as a guide for use in LSD experiences. They hoped to give users of LSD a simulation of death and rebirth, to "liberate" them from past problems or mistakes in their lives.
