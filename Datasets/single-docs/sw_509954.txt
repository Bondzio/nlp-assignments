Eerste Divisie

The Eerste Divisie (English: First Division) is an association football league in the Netherlands. It is the second-highest league in the country. When a team wins the league, they get promoted to the Eredivisie. Until 2015, when a team did bad in the league, they would get sent to the Topklasse. Recently, the team would get sent to the Tweede Klasse instead. The league has been around since 1956.
