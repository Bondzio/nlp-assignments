Division of Kennedy

The Division of Kennedy is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. The division is named after Edmund Kennedy, an explorer in the area where the division is located in Queensland.

The division covers a large area of outback Queensland. It includes the towns of Atherton, Babinda, Camooweal, Charters Towers, Cloncurry, Georgetown, Gordonvale, Hughenden, Ingham, Innisfail, Mareeba, Mount Isa, Normanton and Tully.

Since 1966 the division has been held by the conservative Katter family—Bob Sr. and his son, Bob Jr.—for all but one term. In the 2013 election there was a 17% swing against Katter.
