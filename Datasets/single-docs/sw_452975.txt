Silent Hill: Downpour

Silent Hill: Downpour is a survival horror video game published by Konami Digital Entertainment and developed by Vatra Games. It is the eighth game in the "Silent Hill" series. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

It was released on March 13, 2012 in North America, March 29, 2012 in Europe, April 5, 2012 in Australia, and on November 8, 2012 in Japan for the PlayStation 3. The game is about a prisoner named Murphy Pendleton who enters Silent Hill, every so often enters the alternate dimension and unlocks personal repressed memories.

IGN rated the game a 4.5 out of 10 and said "The most frustrating thing about Silent Hill Downpour isn't the lousy combat, dull exploration, or even the technical gaffes. It's the fact that every now and then while playing through the game's story, you'll see signs of brilliance; sunlight hinted from behind the overcast sky." 

GameSpot gave the game a 7.5 out of 10 and said "Downpour makes some questionable tweaks to the established formula, but those decisions distinguish it from the rest of the series."
