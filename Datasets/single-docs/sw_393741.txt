Plastic Brit

"Plastic Brit" is a rude insult that is used towards sportspeople who were not born in the United Kingdom but were chosen to compete for Great Britain. It was mainly used by the Daily Mail in the build up to the 2012 Summer Olympics. It was argued against by some of the sportspeople who were called "Plastic Brits", including Yamil√© Aldama who wrote a page against it in The Guardian.
