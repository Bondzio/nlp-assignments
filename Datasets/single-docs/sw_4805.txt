List of tectonic plates

This is a list of the biggest tectonic plates on Earth.

These seven plates make up most of the seven continents and the Pacific Ocean.


These plates are generally shown on major plate maps, with the exception of the Arabian and Indian plates, which are smaller than the others.


These are parts of major plates, and bits and pieces of ancient plates that became broken up.
