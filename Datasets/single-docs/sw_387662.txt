"Kōgō" is the title of a non-reigning empress consort. The title, still in use, is generally conferred on an emperor's wife who had given birth to the heir to the throne. The title was first awarded posthumously in 806 to the late mother of Emperor Heizei.

"Chūgū" was a term which evolved during the Heian period; and it came to be understood as the title of the empress. For a time, "chūgū" replaced "kōgō"; and then the titles became interchangeable.

The numbers of "kōgō" varied, but there was only one "Chūgū" at a time.

The title "kōtaigō" was given to the wife of an ex-emperor; and the title "tai-kōtaigō" came to be used by a dowager empress.
