Chipko Movement

The Chipko movement or Chipko Andolan
is a movement that practiced the Gandhianmethods of satyagraha and non-violent resistance. This is mainly done through the act of hugging trees to protect them from being cut down. This was first started by Amrita Devi while protesting against a King's men to cut the tree. The modern Chipko movement began in the early 1970s in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand. It spread to Uttar Pradesh with a growing awareness of rapid deforestation. The landmark event in this struggle took place on March 26, 1974. This is when a group of peasant women in Reni village, Hemwalghati, in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India, acted to prevent the cutting of trees by the contractors assigned by the state Forest Department. Their actions inspired hundreds of such actions at the grassroots level throughout the region. By the 1980s the movement had spread throughout India. This led to the formulation of people-sensitive forest policies, which put a stop to the open felling of trees in regions as far as the Vindhyas and the Western Ghats.
