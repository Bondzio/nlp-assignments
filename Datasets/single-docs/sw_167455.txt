Dianetics

Dianetics is a practice created by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. It is about the way people think. Hubbard also started the religion of Scientology, which uses Dianetics.

The photo at the right shows a person learning about Dianetics by doing a stress test. The idea of the stress test is to show people something in their own minds.

Most psychologists think that Dianetics is a pseudoscience. That means that it is not really a science, and it only looks like one.
