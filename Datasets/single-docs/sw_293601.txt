Blues Music Award

The Blues Music Awards are presented by the Blues Foundation, an organization to promote the blues music. The Blues Foundation started the awards in 1980 under the name W. C. Handy Awards. In 2006 they were renamed Blues Music Awards. The Blues Music Award is one of the highest honors a blues musician can get in the USA.

Like the Grammys the Blues Music Award is given in different categories. The nominees are chosen by a group of people who are connected with Blues music.
