Slalom skiing

Slalom skiing is a special event in the sport of Alpine skiing.

Slalom was first recognized as part of the Winter Olympic Games in 1936.

Slalom is the most technical event in alpine skiing.

A slalom race involves skiing between and around a series of obstacles made of poles which are placed on the snowy slope. These poles are called "gates". There are many gates in a slalom run.

Smaller turns than Super G or Downhill are made because distance between gates is short.

World Cup is the highest international competition of alpine skiing held by International Ski Federation (FIS).

Ingemar Stenmark (Sweden, his career 1973-1989) and Vreni Schneider (Switzerland, her career 1984-1995) are the record holder as the most World Cup titles in Slalom discipline. Stenmark won 8 times and Schneider won 6 times.
