Lahn-Dill-Kreis Rural District

Lahn-Dill is a "Kreis" (district) in the west of Hesse, Germany.
In 1977 the district Gie√üen was merged with the districts Wetzlar and Dillkreis to the new Lahn-Dill-Kreis. However this big district was not popular, so in 1979 Giessen was split from it.

The main rivers of the district are the Lahn and the Dill, which also gave it the name.
