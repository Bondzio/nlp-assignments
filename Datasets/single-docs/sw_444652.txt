Axe (brand)

Axe (known as Lynx in United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand) are a brand of grooming products. They are marketed more towards younger men. 

It was inspired by Unilever's other brand Impulse and was first launched in 1983. Unilever attempted to launch Axe in the rest of Europe but they had to change the name to Lynx because of trademark problems. The company has also run into controversy. Their advertisements have been criticized for their supposed promotion of encouraging sexual promiscuity and sexism. On January 12, 2008, 12 year old Daniel Hurley of Derbyshire, England collapsed at his home and he died five days later. The medical coroner said that Hurley suffered from cardiac arrhythmia and he died from heart failure after he sprayed large amounts of Lynx in a confined space.
