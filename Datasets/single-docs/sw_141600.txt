Mmhmm

Mmhmm is the fourth album made by Relient k. It has other spellings because it's a strange word. It is different from the bands previous albums, because it's heavier but also softer at times with the music. It marks the time where the band became more serious, using fewer joke songs than before.

This was their first album on their record label Capitol Records. It was also the last CD which Brian Pitman (Relient k bassist) recorded with the band.

The album was released again, with a new song which was first found on an EP. In 2005, the album was given gold status, because it had sold half a million copies in America. The album had a few singles which were played only on Christian radio such as "High of 75" and "I so hate consequences".
