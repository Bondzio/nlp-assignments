John Stockton

John Stockton was a point guard for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). No NBA player ever had more assists or steals during his career than Stockton. He spent most of his career playing as a teammate of Karl Malone. Stockton and Malone were firm believers in hard work, and their coach, Jerry Sloan, also strongly believed in working hard in order to compete. Both Stockton and Malone were on the 1992 Dream Team. The Utah Jazz were in the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998 against the Chicago Bulls and their superstar Michael Jordan. Stockton, Malone, and Sloan were all part of the Jazz organization at the time. The Bulls won both of those series.

Stockton retired from the NBA. From start to finish of his NBA career, he stayed with the Jazz.

Stockton played basketball in college at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. Since his retirement from the NBA, he has been very loyal and supportive of Gonzaga, which he lives near. He also grew up in the Spokane area.
