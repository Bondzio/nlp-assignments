Makran (princely state)

Makran was an autonomous princely state of both British India and Pakistan, which ceased to exist in 1955. It was located in the extreme southwest of Pakistan, an area occupied by the districts of Gwadar, Kech and Panjgur. The state did not include the enclave of Gwadar which was under Omani rule until 1958.
