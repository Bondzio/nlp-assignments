Edward Bouchet

Edward Alexander Bouchet became the first African American to earn a doctoral degree.

Bouchet was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1852. He graduated from Hopkins School. Bouchet earned his bachelor degree from Yale University in 1874. At the time, there were few opportunities for African Americans seeking higher education. 

Bouchet is best known for becoming the first African American to earn a doctoral degree in the United States in 1876. After getting his Ph.D. bouchet could not land a college professorship due to his race. With this accomplishment, Bouchet joined a selected group of academics. He taught at the school for Colored Youth in Philadelphia for more than 25 years. 

Bouchet passed away in 1918. In 1998 Yale University honored Edward Bouchet by establishing the Edward Alexander Bouchet Graduate Honor Society in his name, including the Bouchet Leadership Award to academics who helped advance diversity in higher education.
