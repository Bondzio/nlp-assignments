For this reason, the government may intervene to provide it. There are relatively few examples of "purely" public goods, however some examples are:

The reason that the government feels the need to provide these goods is because the Marginal Social Benefit is greater than the Marginal Private Benefit, and so because there are positive externalities in consumption, it will always be under consumed in the market mechanism,
