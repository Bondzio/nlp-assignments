Yoshino Province

, also known as Washū, was an old province of Japan in the area of Nara Prefecture on the island of Honshū. The history of the province started in 716 and ended in 738.

The province was established when Yoshino District was separated from Yamato Province. 

Yoshino Province was abolished sometime after 738. It was reformed as part of Yamato Province.

The Buddhist temple of "Hisosan-ji" was established in the province.
Yoshino was known for locally produced varnishes called lacquer. Cups and bowls and other lacquer ware ("Yoshino nuri") were typically black and red. Yoshino lacquer ("Yoshino urushi") was evaluated as superior.
