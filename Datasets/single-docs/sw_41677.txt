Border dispute

A border dispute is when two governments or more do not agree where border is between two their lands. An example is Israel and Palestine. Another example is Pakistan and India over the territory of Kashmir. An historical example is the Honey War between Iowa and Missouri.

It might be resolved through war or through diplomatic processes or even a Plebiscite. Some examples of disputed territory include Kosovo in the Balkans claimed by Serbia, the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean by the British and Kashmir in Asia, claimed by the Republic of India. There are scores of disputed areas throughout the world with 1.5% of the world's population living in disputed areas. These disputes are often related to the possession of natural resources such as rivers, fertile farmland, mineral or oil and gas resources, although the disputes can also be driven by culture, religion and ethnic nationalism.
