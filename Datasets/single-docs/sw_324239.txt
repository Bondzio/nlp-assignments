Mr. Meaty

Mr. Meaty is an American/Canadian television series, airing on CBC Television in Canada and the Nicktoons Network in the United States. It originally began in 2004, as a series of shorts that aired on Nickelodeon. The show features puppets working at a fast food restaurant called Mr. Meaty.

The show began as a series of shorts featured on CBC's "The Void" and in-between shows on Nickelodeon. Many of the original shorts can still be found on iTunes and TurboNick. 


"Mr. Meaty" received a great deal of criticism from vegetarians and parents who didn't like the gross-out humor. Many petitions were signed and sent to Nickelodeon to end the show.
