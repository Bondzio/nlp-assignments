Harald Hardrada

Harald III of Norway (1015 – September 25, 1066) was born Harald Sigurðarson, but known as Harald Hardrada. He became king of Norway, and thought that he was the rightful heir to the throne of England. In 1066 he invaded England, and was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge by the army of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon King of England.

Publications - which have some traits of fairytales -
by Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241), say that a Sami woman, Snøfrid married Harald Fairhair; furthermore, none of her children or grandchildren became kings; first when Harald Hardrada became a king, then her blood became part of the blood of the royal family.
