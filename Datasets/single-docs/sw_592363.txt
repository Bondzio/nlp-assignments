Moana (2016 movie)

Moana is the 55th Disney Classic. It's rated PG and was realised in the U.K. Cinemas near the end of November I believe. 
From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes Moana, an epic adventure about a spirited teen who sets sail on a daring mission to save her people. Along the way, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) meets the once mighty demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson), and together they cross the ocean on a fun-filled, action-packed voyage. (Extract taken from the Blurb on the Moana DVD).
