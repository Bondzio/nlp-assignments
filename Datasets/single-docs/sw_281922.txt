Oedema

Oedema (also spelled edema) is swelling caused when fluid leaks out of the body's capillaries. (The capillaries are the body's smallest blood vessels.) The fluid builds up and gets trapped in the tissues around the leaking blood vessels. This causes swelling. If there is enough swelling, edema can be seen from outside of the skin.

Edema can happen in any part of the body. However, it is easiest to see in the arms and legs, including the hands, ankles, and feet. Edema in the arms and legs is called "peripheral edema".

"Pulmonary edema "is fluid in the lungs. Pulmonary edema is dangerous because having fluid in the lungs makes breathing difficult. If pulmonary edema gets bad enough, a person can drown in the fluid.

Edema in the abdomen is called "ascites."

Some of the signs and symptoms of edema are:

Edema in the lungs (pulmonary edema) can make it hard to breathe or cause chest pain.

Many things can cause edema. When edema is mild (not very serious), the most common causes are:

However, edema can also be a sign of serious disease. Diseases that can cause edema include:

If edema is not very serious, it often goes away on its own. If a person has mild edema in an arm or leg, they can often make edema go away quicker by keeping the arm or leg raised above the level of the heart.

If edema is more serious, it is treated with medicines called diuretics. These are medicines which help the body get rid of extra fluid by urinating it out.

If edema is caused by a disease, that disease needs to be treated.
