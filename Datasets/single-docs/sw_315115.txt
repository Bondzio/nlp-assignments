Pope Alexander III

Pope Alexander III (; c. 1100 â€“ 30 August 1181), born Orlando Bandinelli, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 171st Pope was Pope from 1159 to 1181. 

He was born in Siena. He was a member of the Bandinelli family.

In 1150, Pope Eugene III made Bandinelli a Cardinal.

Cardinal Bandinelli was elected pope on September 7, 1159; and he chose the name Alexander III. His papacy was disputed by Antipope Victor IV, Antipope Paschal III, Antipope Calixtus III and Antipope Innocent III.

Pope Alexander was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

Alexander's support for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, did not resolve conflicts with the Henry II of England. After Becket was murdered, Alexander canonized him.
