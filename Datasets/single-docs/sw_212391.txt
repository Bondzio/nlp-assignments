Hurricane Martha (1969)

Hurricane Martha was the last hurricane of the active 1969 Atlantic hurricane season. Martha was the only known storm to make landfall in Panama. This also causes Martha to have the record for the southern most landfall of a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Martha made landfall in Veraguas Providence in Panama. Martha killed about 5 people and caused $30 million in damage. 

Because the damage was not very high the name "Martha" was not retired. But, even though it was not retired the name was not used again because the lists names changed in the 1970's.
