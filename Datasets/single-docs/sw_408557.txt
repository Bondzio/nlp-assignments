Clones

Clones ( ; ) is a small town in western County Monaghan, Ireland. The area is part of the Border Region with Northern Ireland. Historically "Clones" was also spelt "Clonis", "Clonish" and "Clownish". These are English language versions of the Irish "Cluain Eois", meaning "Eos's meadow". It has about 2,500 people in the town. 

An abbey was built at Clones by Tigernach (also known as "Tierney" in English). It was built in the early 6th century. It was dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul. The ruins of a 12th-century abbey building can still be found in the town. There is also a sarcophagus. They say it was built for Saint Tighearnach after he died. Clones also has a 9th-century round tower and high cross.

The national inland waterways agency, Waterways Ireland, is planning to restore the Ulster Canal from the Newtownbutler area of Lough Erne to Clones.

Clones has a GAA stadium, St Tiernach's Park. This stadium is regularly used for inter-county matches during the Ulster provincial championship in Gaelic football, and traditionally hosts the final.
