Yoko Kanno

Yoko Kanno (菅野 よう子 "Kanno Yōko", born March 19, 1964 in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan) is a famous composer and keyboardist known for her musical achievements in anime titles.

Some of her most famous pieces include "Voices" ("Macross Plus"), "Tank!" ("Cowboy Bebop"), "Yakusoku wa Iranai" ("Escaflowne"), "Gravity" ("Wolf's Rain"), and "Inner Universe" (""). She was the singer of a band called "The Seatbelts", which was created just to make the "Cowboy Bebop" soundtrack.

She has worked for many Koei games sold from the late 1980s to 1990s and even for a Dreamcast game. Because she worked a lot in the "Cowboy Bebop" anime, the game sold by Bandai also features her work.

Apart from anime and games, Kanno also makes pieces for live-action films and CMs (television advertisements or commercials) for all sorts of brands. Grand Funk Inc. is her recording studio of choice in producing for these two media. Contributions to films started in the 90s but only since 2002 has there been a trend towards the medium. Most of the latter were shown in international film festivals.

There is some rumor that one of her frequently hired vocalists, Gabriela Robin, is Kanno herself under a pseudonym. 

She was married to fellow composer Hajime Mizoguchi, with whom she worked with in order to create the music for "Please Save My Earth" and "Escaflowne".

She has gone to Otakon and Anime Expo in 1999, as well as Anime Expo New York in 2002.

On September 13, 2005, Gamespot said that Kanno had been hired by Gravity Corporation to create the music for their in-development MMORPG, "Ragnarok Online 2". 


All of the movies are live-action except for "Noiseman Sound Insect".
