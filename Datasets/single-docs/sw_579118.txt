The Billy Rose Art Garden

The Billy Rose Art Garden Is the sculpture park designed by the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi on the western slope of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel. The art garden is named after the impresario and lyricist Billy Rose (1899-1966). Isamu Noguchi started to plan the sculpture park from the 1960s on the slopes of the museum grounds and divided the terrain into different sections through walls made of rough unworked field stones. The artificial garden was completed in 1965.
