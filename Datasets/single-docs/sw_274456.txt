Steve Black

Stephen Black (March 31, 1927 - June 12, 2008) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player from Thunder Bay, Ontario in the National Hockey League (NHL).

Steve Black played five years for the Port Arthur Flyers of the TBJHL making two trips to the Memorial Cup Tournament before joining the PCHL. 

In 1946 Black joined the Oakland Seals of the PCHL and showed enough talent to move up to the AHL the following season. After two years in the minors, he finally cracked the NHL with the Detroit Red Wings. The 1950 Wings were already deep in offensive talent with established players such as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay and Sid Abel, so Black was told to concentrate on the defensive aspect of the game. As his defensive skills increased, his overall game improved, and was picked to play in the 1950 NHL All Star Game. The highlight of his career came that spring when he won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings. He started the 1951 season with Detroit before being traded to the Chicago Black Hawks. He would play 39 games for Chicago that season which would also be his last in the NHL. He played in the minor leagues for three more seasons before retiring from hockey in 1954.


With the Detroit Red Wings, Black wore the #19 jersey which would decades later be worn by Steve Yzerman. Black wore the #17 jersey with the Chicago Black Hawks.
