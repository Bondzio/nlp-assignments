Phoenix of New Orleans

The Phoenix of New Orleans (PNOLA) is a non-profit organization that gives help to victims of Hurricane Katrina, specifically those within the New Orleans City Limits. PNOLA was founded by Paul Ikemire, a medical student at Tulane University, in November, 2005. Since then, PNOLA has grown to become one of the main rebuild organizations in the city, giving help to more than 300 families. PNOLA is supported by the United Way and AmeriCorps.

On August 29th, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Coastal Louisiana and Mississippi, with Category 3 force winds across the region. Many cities and towns throughout Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast were affected, ranging from minor damage to complete devastation.
