Ninian Edwards

Ninian Edwards (March 17, 1775 â€“ July 20, 1833) was a founding political figure of the state of Illinois. He was the only governor of the Illinois Territory from 1809 to 1818. He was one of the first two United States Senators from Illinois (from 1818 to 1824). He was the third Governor of Illinois (from 1826 to 1830). In a time and place where personal coalitions were more influential than parties, Edwards led one of the two main factions in frontier Illinois politics. 

Edwards was born on March 17, 1775 in Montgomery County, Maryland. He was married to Elvira Lane until his death in 1833. They had four children. Edwards died on July 20, 1833 in Belleville, Illinois from cholera, aged 58.
