Mumps

Mumps is a viral disease. Only humans get it. Some of the most commons symptoms are fever, headaches, swelling of the parotoid glands, sore throat, and orchitis (which means swelling of the testicles). 

Mumps can be diagnosed by the increase in alpha amylase isoenzymes in blood plasma.

The MMR vaccination stops measles, mumps and rubella.

hence we can say that mumps can be prevented by MMR vaccination
