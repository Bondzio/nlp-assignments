Bermuda at the Olympics

Bermuda was first at the Olympic Games in 1936. 

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Bermuda is BER.

Athletes from Bermuda have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then except the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics. Bermuda has also been in every Winter Olympic Games since 1992.

As of 2011, Clarence Hill is the only Bermudian to win an Olympic medal. This makes Bermuda the least populated nation [53,500 in 1976] in Olympic history to win a medal at the Summer Olympics.

The National Olympic Committee for Bermuda was formed in 1935 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1936.
