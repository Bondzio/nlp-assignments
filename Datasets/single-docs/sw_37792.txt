Spider Riders

While searching a cave, thirteen year old Hunter Steele finds a strange manacle that connects itself to him. When Hunter sees a spider, he falls. Hunter falls straight down to the center of the Earth, into the underground world of "Arachna". Here, he finds a group of people fighting to save Arachna from the attack of giant insect mutants. The people fighting are kids, just like Hunter. Each one is fighting with the help of their own ten-foot spiders. They call themselves "Spider Riders."
