Stan, Kyle and Wendy meet at Stark's Pond and Wendy suggests that they use the device in Cartman's rear-end to contact the aliens, the boys tie Cartman to a tree and a big satellite dish emerges from Cartman's rear-end. The spaceship appears and Kyle's brother Ike leaps to safety. The aliens then begin to talk to the cows seeing them as the smartest species on the planet and Cartman is abducted yet again but is returned to the bus stop the next day.
