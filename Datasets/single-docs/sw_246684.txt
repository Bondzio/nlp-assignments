Thrace

Thrace is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe.

It occupied a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. 

Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey. The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe.

The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians, divided into numerous tribal groups. 

Thracian troops accompanied neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which abuts Thrace) and took on the Persian Empire of the day. 

Divided into separate tribes, the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition, while the tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity. 

Thrace was conquered by Alexander, and later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 , in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of strife and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence.

The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and "Thrace" and "Thracians" are simply the names given them by the Greeks.
