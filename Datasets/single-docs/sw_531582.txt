Hértevin language

Hértevin language (in Hértevin: ܣܘܪܬ "Sôreth") is an Aramaic or Syriac language that was originally spoken in a group of villages in the southeastern part of Turkey. It is especially in Siirt Province. Speakers of Hértevin Aramaic have moved mostly to Western countries, and are now scattered and isolated from one another. A few speakers remain in Turkey.
