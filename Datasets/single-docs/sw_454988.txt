Speak Now

Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 25, 2010 by Big Machine Records. The album was written by Swift herself (other writers helped write her previous albums).

"Speak Now" is in a country-pop style similar to Swift's other work. A deluxe edition was sold in Target stores. That version has three new songs (including the single "Ours") and two acoustic versions of songs on the original. Throughout 2011, Swift promoted the album on the Speak Now World Tour.
