Belfast Quarters

The central area of Belfast has been divided into seven Quarters related to its history:


The Quarters do not evenly divide the city into four parts, and not all of Belfast's city centre is part of a Quarter. Instead, each Quarter has something important in its history and locale. The "Quarter" names were given in 2001.
