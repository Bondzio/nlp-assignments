Mount Ararat

Mount Ararat (Armenian: Արարատ) is the tallest peak in the Armenian Highlands and modern-day Turkey. The mountain is always capped with snow, and it is a dormant volcano. It is in Iğdır Province, near the northeast corner of Turkey, 16 km west of Iran and 32 km south of the Armenian border.

The people and area who lived in this area was the Armenian kingdom of Ararat (in Assyrian: Urartu). The former lived here for nearly 3000 years and it was since 1923 with the Traité de Lausanne that the Ararat was placed in the administration of Turkey.
