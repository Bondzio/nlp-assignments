Disulfur dinitride

Disulfur dinitride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SN. It contains sulfur in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitride ions.

Disulfur dinitride is a colorless crystalline solid. It is explosive, similar to tetrasulfur tetranitride. It easily evaporates. It does not dissolve in water. It turns back into tetrasulfur tetranitride when exposed to water. 

Disulfur dinitride is made by reacting silver with tetrasulfur tetranitride. This makes some silver(I) sulfide, which is a catalyst. This reaction happens in a vacuum (not the one used to clean floors).

It reacts with some chemical compounds that are acids.
