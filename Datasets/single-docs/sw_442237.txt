Takfiri

A Takfiri is a Muslim who says that another Muslim has apostated (left the religion). The word is comes from the word "kafir", meaning somebody who does not follow Islam. The ideology partially comes from hadithic (from narrations from Muhammad's life) requirements to "enjoin [instruct someone to follow] the good and forbid the evil".
