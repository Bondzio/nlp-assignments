Jōkyō calendar

, also called Teikyō-reki, was a Japanese lunisolar calendar ("genka reki"). It was used from 1684-1753. It was made official in 1685.

The "Jōkyō-reki" system was the work of Shibukawa Shunkai. He recognized that the length of the solar year is 365.2417 days.

Shirakawa discovered errors in the traditional Chinese calendar which had been in use for 800 years. This older system was also known as the "Semmyō" calendar or 'Semmei-reki". It was also known as the "Xuanming" calendar.
