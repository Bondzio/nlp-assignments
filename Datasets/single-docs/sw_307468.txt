Donde Quiera Que Estés

"Dondequiera Que Estés" () is the single released by Selena with a duet with the Barrio Boyzz. The song was a major hit in 1994, staying at #1 for 6 weeks on top of the Hot Latin Tracks.

The song was first released on the Barrio Boyzz album Donde Quiera Que Estes in 1993 and was never included on the Amor Prohibido album at the time of the release, but was then included on the reissued version of "Amor Prohibido" in 2002 and also included on Selena's greatest hits collection "Ones".
