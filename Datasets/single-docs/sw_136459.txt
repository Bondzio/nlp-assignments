Skepticism

Skepticism or scepticism (Greek "skeptomai": to consider, to examine) refers to any view involving "doubt".


Skepticism has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy. The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC, such as Protagoras of Abdera (480–411 BC), were for the most part skeptics. Gorgias (485–380 BC) said that "Nothing exists; if anything does exist, it cannot be known; if anything exists and can be known, it cannot be communicated". In the 4th century BC Pyrrho of Elis (c360–275 BC), who travelled and studied as far as India, adopted practical skepticism. Carneades (c213–129 BC) denied absolute truth and falsity. He criticized the Dogmatists, especially supporters of Stoicism, asserting that absolute certainty of knowledge is impossible. Sextus Empiricus (c200 AD), the main authority for Greek skepticism, incorporated empiricism into the basis for asserting knowledge.

The nub of the argument is the proposition that unless we know "something" for certain, then we cannot know anything at all. The interest lies in the way great philosophers have sought to counter this problem. Some, like Descartes, retreat into the mind: "I think, therefore I am". Others, such as the British empiricists John Locke and David Hume, would rely on our sense perception. Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism. For example, an agnostic believes that knowledge of supernatural things cannot be attained. 

Skepticism is widely used as a method for research in science, and (with variations) in modern legal procedure. Here doubt, suspending judgement, methodical investigation, testing and discussion precede any statement of facts. Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached. This systematic approach is called "methodological skepticism". It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics.
