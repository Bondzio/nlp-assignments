Districts of Japan

Districts are not all the same size. They are roughly equivalent to a county in the United Kingdom or the United States. They are smaller than prefectures and larger than towns and villages.

Districts were established in the 8th century. 

Until the 10th century, the chief government official of a district ("gun") was called the "gunji". During the Edo period, the head of a district ("gun") was called the "gundai".

Between 1878 and 1921, the Meiji period and Taish≈ç period, districts were given specific powers and responsibilities which are now diffused.
