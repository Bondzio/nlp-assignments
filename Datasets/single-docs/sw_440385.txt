Ken Ham

Kenneth Alfred "Ken" Ham (born 20 October 1951) is an Australian young-Earth creationist. He is the president of Answers in Genesis (AiG). Ham is also the founder of the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. Ham is a former high school science teacher.

Ham was born on October 20, 1951 in Cairns, Australia. His father was a Christian educator who settled his family in Brisbane as a school principal. Ham earned a Bachelor of Applied Science degree from Queensland Institute of Technology. He also received a diploma in Education from the University of Queensland.

On February 4, 2014, at the Creation Museum, Ham debated Bill Nye (also known as "Bill Nye the Science Guy"). The topic was the question "Is Creation A Viable Model of Origins?". The televised event drew over three million viewers. Ham's position was the world was created about 6,000 years ago. He also defended his position that all animals alive today descend from those aboard Noah's Ark. Nye argued that radioisotopic and ice core data shows that Earth has existed for far longer than 6,000 years. He also added that using the Bible's description of the Ark it could not float. A number of experts were critical of the debate saying that it did not discuss important areas. At least one said neither did very well. An informal viewer's poll showed 92% thought Nye won the debate. However, "Debate is a tool for showing who's a better orator, not necessarily who's right. And Ken Ham is no mean orator, usually," noted the National Center for Science Education, a not-for-profit membership organization that defends the teaching of evolution and climate science."

Ham said of his father:

He married Marilyn "Mally" on 30 December 1972. They have five children together. The Ham couple live in unincorporated Boone County, Kentucky.
