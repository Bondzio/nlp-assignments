Khonsu

Khonsu is the god of the moon, moonlight, and time in Egyptian mythology. In the beginning of the gods, he gambled time with the sky goddess Nut. The goddess Nut won so many times that she could then add five days to the calendar. These days were called the "devil days". Khonsu's father is Sobek, and his mother is Hathor.
