FA Cup

The FA Cup is a national football competition between all clubs in England that are linked with the sport's governing body in that country, The Football Association. The winner of the FA Cup usually goes through to the next season's UEFA Europa League. If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European competition, then the Europa League place goes to the runner-up. If the runner-up has also qualified for a European competition, then the Europa League place goes to 6th or 7th place, depending on who won the Football League Cup. The FA Cup final is held at Wembley Stadium, and currently both semi-finals are also held at Wembley, but in the past both semi-finals were played at neutral stadiums. The FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world and first took place in 1871.

The current holders (winners of the cup in 2017) are Arsenal football club, of London. The cup has been won by Arsenal more times than any other team with 13 wins.
