Western civilization

Western civilization, western culture or the West is made up of Europe (Western and Central Europe), Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and (in part) South Africa. 

The westernization is the transformation of the culture of a country, to Western standards.

Western civilization was defined by historian Arnold Toynbee as that part of the world in which those who practice the Christian religion are in a majority. By this definition, parts of Africa would now also be part of Western civilization since many Africans have been converted to Christianity since the 1950s. The most common languages spoken in Western civilization are English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Afrikaans.
