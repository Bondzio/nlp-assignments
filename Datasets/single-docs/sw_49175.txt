Bending

"This article is about the structural behavior. For other meanings see Bending (disambiguation)."

In engineering and mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a structural elementsubjected to a lateral load (i.e. at right angles to its length). 

A structural element subjected to bending is known as a beam. 

A closet rod sagging under the weight of clothes is an example of a beam experiencing bending.
