Odd number

Can only odd numbers be prime? What about considering irrational and fraction numbers or decimal approximations of each of these? Does it matters where one rounds the answer to?
An integer that is not an odd number is an even number.
Some sequential even numbers are: {0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16...}.
An even number is defined as a whole number that is a multiple of two.
If an even number is divided by two, the result is another whole number.
On the other hand, an odd number, when divided by two, will result in a fraction. 

Since odd and even numbers are defined only in reference to the set of integers (..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), all negative numbers can also be either odd or even.

To find the set of odd natural numbers, we use 2"N"+1 where "N" is any natural number starting with 0.
