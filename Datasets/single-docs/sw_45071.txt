Eastern Europe

Eastern Europe is the eastern region of Europe. The term "Eastern Europe" still means such European countries that until the end of the Cold War were Post-Soviet states in Europe or states in Europe that once belong to the Soviet Union. Others describe Eastern Europe as a region of predominantly Slavic cultures, but other ethnic groups live there as well.

According to the most common contemporary definitions - including those used by the UN Statistics Division, several other UN organizations and EuroVoc (the multilingual thesaurus of the EU) - the following states are in Eastern Europe:


Contemporary developments since January 1993 have led to the reassessment of which countries make up Eastern Europe among some groups. Although the list shown above is still the most popular and widely accepted definition of this region, some experts divide the region further into subsections. According to such theories: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are in Central Europe (the western sections of Belarus and Ukraine are also sometimes listed as Central European) or East-Central Europe. Finally, the countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania and Slovenia are occasionally grouped with a number of other countries into Southern Europe, but more often referred to as Southeast (or Southeastern) Europe.
