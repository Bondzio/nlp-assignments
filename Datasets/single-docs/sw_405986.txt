Tahiti rail

The Tahiti rail ("Gallirallus pacificus") or Tahiti red-billed rail is a poorly known extinct species of rail. It once lived on Tahiti. The second voyage of James Cook in 1773 got one. It was described by Johann Reinhold Forster and painted by his son, Georg. The Tahitian name was ebōnā or ōmnā.

Due to a major mix-up with the name, the name "Rallus ecaudatus" was commonly used in the mid-late 20th century to refer to this bird. This is, however, in error, as the name is a subspecies of the buff-banded rail. Today it is known as "Gallirallus philippensis ecaudatus". Also, at least once, the Tahitian bird has been referred to by the scientific name of the Samoan wood rail, "Gallinula pacifica", in a major scientific work.

Not much is known about the bird's extinction. One idea is that the bird might have been prey to other species. The bird's habitat had active volcanos.
