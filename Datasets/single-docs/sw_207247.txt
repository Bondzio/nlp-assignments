Malcolm Turnbull

Malcolm Bligh Turnbull (born 24 October 1954) is an Australian politician. He is the leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister of Australia. He was Minister for Communications in the government of Australia under Prime Minister Tony Abbott from 18 September 2013 until 14 September 2015. Turnbull is also the former Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Parliament, and former leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Brendan Nelson on 16Â September 2008. 

He lost the leadership positions on 1 December 2009, by one vote to Tony Abbott. Turnbull had agreed to allow the government's emissions trading scheme (ETS) to pass through the parliament. This was opposed by many people in the Liberal Party who argued that an ETS was unnecessary. Other people in the party thought an ETS would harm Australia's coal exports. Others in the party did not like the way that Turnbull managed the arguments within his party.
