Taihō (era)

The system of "nengō" mirrored the Chinese system of eras ("nianhao"). The use of "nengō" marked a new phase in the history of the Imperial court. It became an example of growth in political power.

Taihō was adopted to mark the discovery of gold in Tsushima.

The system of Japanese era names was not the same as Imperial reign dates.
