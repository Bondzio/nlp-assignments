Federal Hall

Federal Hall was the first capitol building of the United States, and was the site where George Washington was inaugurated as America's first president in 1789. In 1700, it was built and named New York City Hall, but was renamed to Federal Hall when it became the capitol under the United States Constitution. In 1812, the building was demolished. A new customs house replaced it in 1842. In 1882, a bronze statue of President Washington was made and put in front of the steps of the rebuilt hall. The hall officially became a landmark according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on 21 December 1965.
