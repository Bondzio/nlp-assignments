Division of Capricornia

The Division of Capricornia is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The division was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the Tropic of Capricorn, which runs through the Division. It covers the area around Rockhampton on the central Queensland coast. It includes the towns of Mount Morgan and Yeppoon, and Great Keppel Island.

The most famous member was Frank Forde, who was the Prime Minister of Australia for eight days in 1945.
