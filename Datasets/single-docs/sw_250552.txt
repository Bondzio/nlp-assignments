U.S. Route 101 in California

In the U.S. state of California, U.S. Route 101 (US 101) is one of the last remaining and longest U.S. Routes still active in the state, and the longest highway of any kind in California. US 101 was also one of the original U.S. Routes established in 1926.

This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System.

US 101 starts north at Olympia, Washington, runs south through the rest of Washington, through Oregon and then through California to Los Angeles.

The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is part of US 101.

Southern Californians usually refer to the highway as The 101 (where it is mostly a freeway). In Northern California, people simply call it 101.
