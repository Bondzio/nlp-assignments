WWE Saturday Morning Slam

WWE Saturday Morning Slam was a professional wrestling show made by the WWE.

During its televised history in the United States it was shown on The CW during its Vortexx Saturday morning block. It was centered around being more family-friendly and targeted towards children. The show ran from August 25, 2012 to May 11, 2013. The show was cancelled because of creative differences between both the WWE and Saban Brands.
