1925 Geneva Protocol

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 was a law that set made it illegal to fight with chemical or biological weapons in war. Before, it was signed by some countries like the United Kingdom and France originally. Any country who has signed this Protocol must follow it.

After World War I, the Geneva Protocol was made from the treaties signed with Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.

After signing the treaty, some countries wanted to change it so that they would not have to follow it if the country fighting them did not follow the treaty. Because of this, many countries like France and United Kingdom withdrew from it. Others, like the United States still follow it but with this extra condition.
