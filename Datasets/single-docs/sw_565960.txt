Vrbanjci

Vrbànjci is a village in the Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Municipality of Kotor Varoš
(Republika Srpska) 

Vrbanjci spread along the Vrbanja river (for which it is named), between its tributaries Jezerka, Bosanka, and Cvrcka. 

The history of this area commemorates the battle on The Field of Večići, on the Vrbanja river, where was the clash between the Ottomans army and repressed pro Bosnian forces, from almost the entire State of Bosnia. According to the historical context, it probably happened around 1463, when Bosnia fell under Ottoman Administration.

During the last War in Bosnia (1992–1995), Serb paramilitary and police forces have committed severe crimes against the civilian Bosnisk's and Croats populations in Vrbanjaca and surrounding villages, including Večići

Most of the refugies Bosniak population are back in their native lands and have restored their houses, with the assistance of the international community, but above all thanks to their own resources.
