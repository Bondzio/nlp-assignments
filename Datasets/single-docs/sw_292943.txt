North East MRT Line

The North East MRT Line (NEL) was the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. It is the world's second longest fully-underground, automated and driverless, rapid transit line after Singapore's Circle MRT Line. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour. This line is coloured purple in the rail map.

The line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations. This line is the first in Singapore to be totally underground.
