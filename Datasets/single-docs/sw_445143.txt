Arrondissements of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department

There are 3 arrondissements in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.
