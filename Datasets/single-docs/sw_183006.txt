Light-independent reaction

Light-independent reactions take place in plant chloroplasts. In this process sugars are made from carbon dioxide. The process, known as the Calvin cycle, uses products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various enzymes. Therefore, the light-independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction. Sugars made in the light-independent reactions are then moved around the plant by translocation. Takes places in the grana region of the chloroplast.


The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following:
