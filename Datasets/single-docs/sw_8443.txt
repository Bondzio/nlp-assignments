1715

In 1715 lots of people who didn't like king George I of Great Britain rebelled in Scotland. These people were the Jacobites and they wanted James Francis Edward Stuart to be king instead of George I. Their luck was going well at first when they managed to take control of most of Scotland but the British Army came in and they lost.
