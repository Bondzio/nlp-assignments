WWE Backlash

Backlash was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment, which started in 1999 and was held in April (but in 2005, it was held in May). From 2004 to 2006, only WWE Raw superstars appeared at Backlash.

The 2007 event was the first WWE PPV event since Judgment Day 2003 (other than Wrestlemania, Summerslam, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series) to feature all three brands (Raw, SmackDown! and ECW) after WWE stopped with brand-only events.

The last Backlash PPV was in 2009. It was replaced by Extreme Rules in 2010.
