Tonka bean

Dipteryx odorata is a species of flowering tree in the pea family Fabaceae. Its seeds are known as Tonka beans. They are black and wrinkled and have a smooth brown center.

Tonka Beans had been used as a vanilla substitute, as a perfume, and in tobacco before being banned in some countries. They are used in some French cuisine (particularly, in desserts and stews) and in perfumes. Today, main producers of the seeds are Venezuela and Nigeria.

The beans were also spelled as "Tonquin" and "Tonkin", although it has no link with Tonkin, now part of Vietnam.
