Distance education

Distance education (or distance learning) is a form of education where the teacher and the student(s) are not at the same physical location.

It follows that the teaching must be done via some kind of medium or a collection of media. Print, film, television, radio and computer web sources have been used. In 1840 Isaac Pitman began teaching his shorthand by sending and receiving postcards. His success led to the establishment of correspondence schools.
