Hypothetical

A "hypothetical' entity is an entity which exists only in a hypotheses. Ergo, it is theorized as possibly existing, or imagined in a scenario separate from common reality. To be "hypothetically speaking" means to be speaking about a scenario which does not exist. However, sometimes "hypothetically speaking" can be talking about a scenario which does exist, but the speaker does not wish the listener to be aware that it does. A hypothetical particle or quantum theory is hypothesized by scientists and physicists as existing, but does not necessarily exist.
The word hypothetical is derived from the Greek term hypothetikos, meaning "pertaining to a hypotheses." Hypotheses are hypothetical scenarios imagined by scientists and inventors pertaining to an invention or scientific theory.
