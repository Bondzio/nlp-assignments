Students for a Free Tibet

Students For a Free Tibet (SFT) is an American non-profit international group of students and activists working with the Tibetan people for human rights and freedom. It was started in 1994. The group educates people and uses non-violent methods of action for making Tibet independent. SFT tries to influence public policy decisions within government institutions. It recommends self-determination for Tibet because of Tibet's historical status. It opposes the Chinese government's violation of the Tibetan people's human rights, cultural heritage, environment, language and religion.
