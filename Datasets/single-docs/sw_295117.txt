Pakistani architecture

Pakistani architecture includes various structures built during different time periods. With the beginning of the Indus Valley civilization around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, for the first time in the area which encompasses today's Pakistan an advanced urban culture developed with large structural facilities, some of which survive to this day. This was followed by the Gandhara style of Buddhist architecture that borrowed elements from the architecture of ancient Greece. These remnants are visible in the Gandhara capital of Taxila.
