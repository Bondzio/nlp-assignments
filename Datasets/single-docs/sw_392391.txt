Mega Man Anniversary Collection

Mega Man Anniversary Collection is a compilation video game for the Nintendo GameCube, Playstation 2, and Xbox. It was released on June 23, 2004 for the GameCube and Playstation 2, and on March 15, 2005 for the Xbox. It contains the first eight "Mega Man" games, as well as two spin-off fighting games in the series. It also contains extras such as original artwork and remixed music.

For the first six games, a "Navi Mode" is available. This allows players to get hints from helpers if they are in need of help. It also changes the look of the health and weapon meters, as well as the weapon screen, for the first three games.
