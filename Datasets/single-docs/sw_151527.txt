BC Lions

The BC Lions are a Canadian Football League team from Vancouver, BC. The Lions play their games at BC Place Stadium. The Lions play in the CFL West Division. The Lions were started in 1954 and used to play at Empire Stadium in East Vancouver. They also played at the Empire Stadium site in 2010 and 2011, in a temporary stadium called Empire Field. This was necessary because BC Place was closed in those seasons for major renovations.

The Lions have won the Grey Cup six times, most recently at BC Place in 2011.
