David Herman

David Herman is an American actor, comedian and voice actor best known as an original cast member of "MADtv" and for his role as Michael Bolton in "Office Space". He is also known for his voice roles on television programs such as "Futurama", and "King of the Hill".

David Herman was born in New York City and raised in Washington Heights. He graduated from the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in 1987, then attended the acting program at SUNY Purchase. Herman appeared in the films "Born on the Fourth of July", "Lost Angels" and "Let It Be Me", but he is probably best known for his role as Michael Bolton in Mike Judge's "Office Space". Earlier, Herman had joined the cast of John Leguizamo's "House of Buggin'" in 1994; however, that show was short-lived. When FOX decided to mount a sketch comedy show to replace "House of Buggin"', Herman was kept on as an original "MADtv" cast member.
