Torsion (mechanics)

In solid mechanics, torsion is the twisting of an object that is result of an applied torque. In circular sections, the resultant shearing stress is perpendicular to the radius.

The shear stress at a point on a shaft is:
"T" is the applied torque, "r" is the distance from the center of rotation, and "J" is the polar moment of inertia.

The angle of twist can be found by using:
Where:
