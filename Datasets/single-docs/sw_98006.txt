The first stage, a line with 17 stations between Nopo-dong and Beomnaegol opened on the 19 July 1985. There are now 102 stations, four lines, and of tracks.

The system is operated by Busan Transportation Corporation. It was first launched in 1985 with Line 1 (Nopo-dong(노포동)~Beomnaegol(범내골)) was opened. Now there are 3 lines with 94 stations, 95.8 kilometers of tracks. Busan Transportation Corporation publishes a name of 'Humetro' as a brand identity.

And it passes right through the heart of the city. It is 32.5km long with 34 stations. The subway used in Line 1 is middle-sized subway. It was made of stainless domestically for the first time when being constructed. And It is a 8-cars train. Many cutting edge technologies (including NATM, TBM construction methods) were used to construct line 1. 

Line 2 (Hopo(호포)~Seo-myeon(서면)) first began operation in 1999, and the entire route (Jangsan(장산)~Hopo(호포)) was completed in 2002. Line 2 was built to solve chronic heavy traffic from east to west of the city. In 2008, the extension route (Hopo(호포)~Yangsan(양산)) was launched for developing transportation system between Busan and Yangsan city. The whole line 2 is 45.2km in length, 43 stations. It is middle-sized subway and a 6-cars train. Shield construction method was used to build line 2. It was the first time to use this method when constructing the subway line in the country. This method was needed to build the line across Suyeong River.

Line 3 (Suyeong(수영)~Daejeo(대저)) started its service in 2005. It is aimed at reducing traffic in Mandeok(만덕), Minam(미남) and Yeonsan-dong(연산동).

It is expected to promote development of Geumsa(금사), Bansong(반송) and Gijang(기장) regions. Line 4 subway is light rail. Light rail consumes only 80% money in construction and management compared to existing heavy rail. 

This line is operated by Busan-Gimhae Light Rail Transit Corporation. This line (from Sasang(사상) to Gaya University) will link the western area of Busan to adjoining city of Gimhae. It will have 21 stations and 23.9km of track. It is planned to be completed in 2011.
