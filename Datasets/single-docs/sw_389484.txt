Maximum and minimum

In mathematics, the maximum and minimum of a function are the largest and smallest value that the function takes at a given point. Together they are known as the extrema (singular: extremum).

Minimum means the least you can do of something. For example, if the minimum amount of dollars you must pay for something is seven, then you can not pay six dollars or less (you must pay at least seven). You can do more than the minimum, but no less. Maximum means the most you can have of something. For example, if the maximum amount of oranges you can juggle is five, you can not juggle more than five oranges. You can do the maximum or less.

For a differentiable function formula_1, if formula_2 is an extreme value for the set of all values formula_3, and if formula_4 is in the interior of the domain of formula_1, then formula_4 is a critical point, by Fermat's theorem.
