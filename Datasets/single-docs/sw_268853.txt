Polacanthus

Polacanthus was an armoured, spiked, plant-eating dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous, about 132 to 100 million years ago. "Polacanthus" means "many spines." 

Some paleontologists think that "Polacanthus" is the same genus as "Hylaeosaurus". Fossils of this ankylosaurid have been found in England. 

"Polacanthus" was about 12 feet (4 m) long and about 4.8 feet (1.5 m) tall. It was a bulky quadruped that relied on its many rows of bony spikes for protection. No head is known for this genus.
