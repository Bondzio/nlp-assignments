Batman: Arkham Origins

Batman: Arkham Origins is an action-adventure video game made by Warner Bros. Games Montr√©al. It is available for Microsoft Windows and the PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 video game systems. The game is based on the DC Comics superhero Batman and is the third in the "Batman: Arkham" series. It was released worldwide by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on October 25, 2013.

Unlike previous "Arkham" games, "Arkham Origins" is not made by Rocksteady Studios. It is also written by Dooma Wendschuh and Corey May. The main story takes place five years before the events of 2009's "Batman: Arkham Asylum". The game shows a younger and not entirely formed Batman who has a bounty placed on his head by crime lord Black Mask. This attracts eight of world's greatest assassins to Gotham City on Christmas Eve. While having to deal with the dirty members of the police department, other villains also attract Batman's attention. Like previous "Arkham" games, "Arkham Origins" is played from the third-person view. The game greatly focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and use of gadgets. "Arkham Origins" is the first game in the series to have a multiplayer mode.

The game mainly got positive reviews. But it was slammed for copying material from previous "Arkham" games without improvement, or pointlessly changing it. A tie-in game titled "Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate" was released along with "Arkham Origins". "Origins Blackgate" is available for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. A mobile version of "Arkham Origins" was created for iOS and Android systems. The mobile version was made available for download in October 2013.
