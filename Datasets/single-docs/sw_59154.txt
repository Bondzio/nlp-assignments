Service of worship

A service of worship is a religious meeting where people of a church come together, usually in a cathedral or church building, in order to worship God. It may also be called a church service or prayer service or just service. It is the usual term used in the Christian religion for such a meeting. The term is also used sometimes in Judaism, although "prayer service" or just "service" are more common.

In the Protestant church services are usually led by a pastor, although sometimes they may be led by laymen (people who are not priests).

In the Christian churches services are normally held on Sundays, although there may be services on other days as well, especially in large churches or cathedrals.

Services often include Holy Communion or Eucharist. Matins is a morning service which does not include communion. An evening service is called Evensong.

Church services are also held for weddings, funerals, or other special occasions.

Services may include prayers, singing, sermons (preaching) and readings from the Bible.
In Judaism, most prayer services are built around two main prayers:
Jewish prayer services are held whenever the "Amidah" prayer is said. In the morning and evening, they also include "Shema."
