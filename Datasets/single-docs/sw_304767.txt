Selous' zebra

The Selous' zebra ("Equus quagga borensis") is one of the six subspecies of the plains zebra ("Equus quagga"). Selous' Zebra is a critically endangered species. These are often confused with the Damaraland zebras ("Equus quagga antiquorum"), and the Chapman Zebra ("Equus quagga chapmani"). The Selous' Zebra's belly is partly striped and they have clean black and white banding. They do not have the brown shadow stripes of the Chapman Zebra. 

Selous's Zebra lives in the northwest of Kenya, parts of Uganda, and the southeast of Sudan.
