2015 Chapel Hill shooting

The 2015 Chapel Hill shooting was an incident that happened on February 10, 2015 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Three Muslim college students were shot dead. Their neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks was arrested for it. Families of the victims called it a hate crime. Police do not know why Hicks might have done it. Police in Chapel Hill say Hicks had argued with the victims over parking spaces before. Neighbors said Hicks was obsessed over people parking in his space. His Facebook page says he supports “Atheists for Equality” and blamed “radical Christians and radical Muslims" for causing problems in the world. 
Police are still investigating. The FBI has been called in to help the local police. They have also started an investigation to see if any federal laws have been broken. So far federal officials do not have any evidence it is a hate crime.
