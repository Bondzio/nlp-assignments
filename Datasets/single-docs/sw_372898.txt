Xerochrysum

Xerochrysum (or "Bracteantha") is a type or genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It was defined by Russian botanist Nikolai Tzvelev in 1990. It was identified before (and taking precedence over) "Bracteantha" which was described the following year. A 2002 molecular study of the tribe Gnaphalieae found the genus is likely polyphyletic, with "X. bracteatum" and "X. viscosum" removed from each other.

There are currently 7 recognized species:


The genus was formerly included in "Helichrysum".
