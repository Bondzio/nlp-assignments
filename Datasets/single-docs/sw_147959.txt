British Rail Class 153

The British Rail Class 153 "Sprinter" is a single-car diesel multiple unit train.

In the early 1990s, British Rail took the decision that running 2-car trains on rural routes was inefficient, and identified the need for single-carriage trains. Initially consideration was given to splitting the Met-Cam Class 156 units to form class 152 units, however due to various problems with the Class 155 units, the decision was taken to split these units instead.

Work was undertaken by Hunslett-Barclay in Kilmarnock between 1991 and 1992. The modifications included fitting a cramped cab to the B end of each carriage, making it extremely difficult to load a bicycle!
