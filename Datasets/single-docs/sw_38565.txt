Metallica (album)

Metallica (also known informally as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by thrash metal band Metallica. It was released in 1991 by Elektra Records. It debuted at #1 in the "Billboard" 200, making "Metallica" the band's first album to do so. Currently, "Metallica" has sold over 15 million copies in the United States alone. It is the band's most successful album.

The album was hard for the band to make. Ulrich, Hammett and Newsted got divorces with their wives because of the stress.

Six singles were released from the album: "Enter Sandman", "The Unforgiven", "Nothing Else Matters", "Wherever I May Roam", "Sad but True", and "Don't Tread on Me". "Enter Sandman" was the best-selling. It won Best Metal Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.

The album won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1992.

In 2012 Metallica played the whole album in their 2012 European Black Album Tour from the end to the start.
