Olaf Kölzig

Olaf Kölzig (born April 6, 1970) is a South African-born German retired professional ice hockey goaltender. He played a career total of 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Kölzig was born in South Africa, but he grew up in several cities across Canada and his family moved to Union Bay, British Columbia, Canada, when he was a teenager. Kölzig never applied for Canadian citizenship, which, combined with his German parentage and German passport, allows him to represent Germany internationally. In May 2008 Kolzig announced that he would not return to the Capitals.
