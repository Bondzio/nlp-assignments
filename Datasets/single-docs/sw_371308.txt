Ranjit Singh

Maharaja Ranjit Singh (13 November 1780 â€“ 27 June 1839) was the founder of the Sikh Empire, which came to power in the Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. This was based in the Punjab region, from around 1799 to 1849. The capital was at Lahore.

After Ranjit Singh's death, his successors were weak and divided and the entire Punjab fell to the British East India Company, later to become part of British India.
