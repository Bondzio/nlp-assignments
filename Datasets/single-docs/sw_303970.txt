Malaysia at the Olympics

Malaysia was first at the Olympic Games in 1956. 

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Malaysia was MAL. It is now MAS.

Teams from Malaysia have been in every Summer Olympic Games since 1956, except the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics. Malaysia has never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

As the Federation of Malaya, the nation was named"Malaya" (MAL) for the 1956 and 1960 Games. North Borneo sent an independent team to the 1956 Games, and Singapore had also competed at the Olympics from 1948 to 1960. After these British colonies formed an independent "Malaysia" in 1963, the nation competed under that name for the first time at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Singapore regained independence from Malaysia in 1965 and competed once again as Singapore at the Olympics from 1968 onwards.

Malaysian athletes have won a total of six Olympic medals. Most are in badminton.

The National Olympic Committee for Malaysia was formed in 1953 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1954.
