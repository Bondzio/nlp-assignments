Brooklyn Nets

The Brooklyn Nets are a team in the National Basketball Association in the New York City community of Brooklyn. They moved into their current home arena, Barclays Center, for the 2012â€“13 season.

The team was founded as the New Jersey Americans in 1967, and played in the American Basketball Association (ABA). After one season in that state, they moved to Long Island, becoming the New York Nets. In 1976, the Nets were one of four ABA teams that joined the NBA, and returned to New Jersey a year later, becoming the New Jersey Nets. After their return to New Jersey, they played on the campus of Rutgers University. In 1981, they moved to East Rutherford, closer to New York City. In 2010, they moved to Newark, and played there until their new Brooklyn arena was built. Once they moved to Brooklyn, they became the Brooklyn Nets.
