Ammar Mosque and Osman Ramju Sadick Islamic Centre

The Ammar Mosque and Osman Ramju Sadick Islamic Centre () or Wan Chai Mosque is a mosque and Islamic center in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China. It is the third mosque in Hong Kong. The original building of the mosque was built in 1967.

The original building of the mosque was a small mosque besides a cemetery at 7 Seymore Street. In 1978, the mosque was relocated to a new place at Oi Kwan Road because the land was needed by the government to construct Aberdeen tunnel. The new mosque building was reopened on September 1981.

The mosque was designed by architect Ramju Sadick. The mosque has eight floors which consists of prayer hall, Chinese restaurant, bakery, clinic, classrooms, library and seminar room.

The mosque is the headquarter place for Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong (the main Islamic organization in Hong Kong) and the Hong Kong Islamic Youth Association.
