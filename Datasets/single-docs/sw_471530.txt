Common teal

The common teal ("Anas crecca") is a duck that lives in many places in Europe and Asia. It is sometimes called the Eurasian teal. 

It mates in places where the weather is temperate (not very hot and not very cold), but in winter it flies south to avoid the cold. People often call it simply the teal because it is the only kind of teal in most of the places where it lives. (Teal is also the name of a color between blue and green. The bird has this color around its eyes.)

When it is not starting a family, the teal likes to be with other teals. Groups of teal may have a great many members. It often lives in places where the ground is very wet and the wind is usually not strong. It does not go under the water to find its food. Instead, it stays on top of the water and eats seeds and bugs that live in the water. 

Some scientists think that another kind of teal, the North American green-winged teal ("A. carolinensis"), is a kind of common teal.
