The Ministry of Darkness

The Ministry of Darkness was a heel professional wrestling stable in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The team was led by The Undertaker. The stable was controversial due to their pseudo-Satanic themed storylines which included rituals and sacrifices. The stable lasted from January 1999 until April 29, 1999. The Ministry of Darkness would eventually merge with The Corporation and form The Corporate Ministry. 

During their time in The Ministry of Darkness, The Undertaker was a one-time WWF Champion, The Acolytes were two-time WWF Tag Team Champions and Mideon was a one-time WWF European Champion.
