W-League (Australia)

The W-League is the main women's semi-professional football (soccer) league in Australia. Started in 2008, it has eight teams. Seven of them are partners with seven of the Australian clubs in the A-League. The eighth team is based in Canberra. Because it is sponsored by the Westfield Group, the League is called the Westfield W-League.

The W-League started on 25 October 2008. 

One game per week is broadcast live nationwide on ABC1.

The teams in the W-League have a salary cap of A$150,000 for the entire squad. By comparison, the salary cap for clubs in the men's competition, the A-League, is A2.35 million.

The league had eight teams. The Central Coast Mariners had to withdraw from the 2010â€“11 season. This was because they did not have enough money.
