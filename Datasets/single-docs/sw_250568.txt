The Dirty Energy Dilemma

The Dirty Energy Dilemma is a 2008 book by academic Benjamin K. Sovacool. In the book Sovacool discusses some of the "big energy challenges" facing the United States, and suggests that the fix for these problems is 'clean energy' in the form of energy efficiency and renewable energy. Sovacool sees no role for nuclear power in a clean energy transition.

"The Dirty Energy Dilemma" won a 2009 Nautilus Award.
