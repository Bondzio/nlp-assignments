Air pollutants

An air pollutant is a substance in the air that can have adverse effects on Humans and the ecosystem. The substance can be solid particles, liquid droplets or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made. Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are usually produced from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other examples include carbon monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhaust, or the sulphur dioxide released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they from in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. Ground level ozone is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary. They are both emitted directly and formed from primary pollutants.
