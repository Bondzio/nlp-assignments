Oakland Athletics

The Oakland Athletics, also known as the Oakland A's, are a professional Major League Baseball team based in Oakland, California. The Athletics are a member of the Western Division of the American League. From to today, the Athletics have played in Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.

The Athletics were an original member of the American League in 1901, playing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name "Athletics" had been used by several other Philadelphia teams dating back to the 1860s. Most of the various "Athletics" teams wore a Gothic or Old English letter "A" on their uniforms. The current Athletics still often wear that old-style "A" or "A's" on their uniforms.

The old Athletics were very successful, winning several World Series championships. By the early 1950s, they were not playing well and the fans were no longer supporting them. So after over 50 years in Philadelphia, the Athletics moved to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1955. They were not very successful there, either. They moved again, to Oakland, in 1968. As the Oakland A's, they have won several World Series.
