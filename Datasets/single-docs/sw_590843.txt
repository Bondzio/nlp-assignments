Quit India Movement

The Quit India Movement was started in 1942 when during the Second World War Japan had captured Singapore and was now marching towards India. The Indians felt that their country was being attacked by the Japanese because of the presence of British in their country. Mahatma Gandhi asked the British to leave India for good. The British government took harsh measure to stop it. Many congress leaders including Mahatma Gandhi were arrested and the Congress was banned. There was a strong protest against this all over the country. There were hartals and hunger strikes all over the country. Finally the British government also understood that it could not keep India under its control for long and decided to prepare to leave India with bag and baggage.
