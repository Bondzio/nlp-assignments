Church of Pakistan

The Church of Pakistan is a united church in Pakistan, which is part of the Anglican Communion and also a member church of the World Methodist Council. It was established in 1970 with a union of Anglicans, Scottish Presbyterians (Church of Scotland), United Methodists, and Lutherans. 

The Church is divided into eight administrative and organisational units, called dioceses. Each diocese has a number of parishes within its jurisdiction. Each diocese is presided over by a bishop, who sits at the diocesan head office, usually located in the district capital.
