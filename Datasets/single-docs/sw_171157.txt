Korea Republic national football team

The Korea Republic national football team is the national football team of South Korea.

Korea Republic is the most successful Asian football team in the history of the FIFA World Cup having participated in eight World Cup tournaments, which is the most amount of appearances for any Asian country. Korea Republic became the first and only Asian team to reach the semi-final stages, at the 2002 tournament (Where it achieved 4th place), and also won the first two editions of the AFC Asian Cup. The current team, with players such as Chung Yong Lee, Ki Sung Yueng, Park Chu Young, Lee Keun Ho, Ji Dong won, Lee Dong Gook, and Koo Jacheol is easily a good contender for upcoming competitions too. With the new coach Hong MyungBo, South-Korea might earn a good place in the FIFA World cup of 2013.
