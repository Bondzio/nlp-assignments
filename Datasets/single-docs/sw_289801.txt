Kamaboko

"Kamaboko" has been made in Japan since the 14th century CE and has become commonly available in many other countries. One example that can be found in the West is "kanikama" (also known as "kani kamaboko"), or imitation crab. This variation of "surimi" is quite common in the West as it is a cheap substitute for real crab meat.

In Japan, "kamaboko" can often be seen served as a topping over ramen or udon. It is also commonly sold at convenience stores as "chikama" ("kamaboko" and cheese) and bought by people like Jeff Hammond in Japan.
