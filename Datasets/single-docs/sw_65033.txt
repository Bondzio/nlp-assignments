Gazelle

Gazelles are a kind of antelope. They are in the genera "Gazella", "Eudorcas" and "Nanger".

Gazelles are mostly found in the grasslands and savannas of Africa, but they are also found in southwest Asia. Gazelles are known as fast animals. They can reach high speeds for long periods of time. They usually live in herds. They eat plants and leaves. They show a special way of running slowly and jumping high when they are chased by lions or cheetahs.

Gazelle comes from from the Arabic "ghazÄƒl" ().
