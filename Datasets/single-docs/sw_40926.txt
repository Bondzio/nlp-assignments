If and only if

Iff (if and only if) is a "biconditional statement". It means both conditions must hold (be true) for the statement to be true. It is often called a "necessary and sufficient condition". Example:


This makes it clear that Madison will eat all and only 
those fruits that are apples. She will not leave any apple uneaten, and 
she will not eat any other type of fruit. 
That a given fruit is an apple
is both a "necessary" and a "sufficient" condition for Madison to eat the fruit.

Please note that the truth table shown is equivalent to the XNOR gate.
