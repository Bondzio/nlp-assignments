We'll Bring the House Down

We'll Bring the House Down is a 1981 rock album by English band Slade. It was the band's ninth studio album. After the band's period of low popularity, the band played at the 1980 Reading Festival, after Ozzy Osbourne cancelled his appearance at the last minute. The band's performance gave them popularity again and the album peaked at #25 in the UK, becoming their comeback album. The album used some songs from their previous album "Return to Base" from 1979.

The album featured the singles "We'll Bring the House Down" and "Wheels ain't Coming Down".
