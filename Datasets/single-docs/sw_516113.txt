James Cross

James Richard "Jasper" Cross, CMG (born September 29, 1921) is a British former diplomat in Canada. He was kidnapped by Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) militants during the October Crisis of October 1970.

On October 5, 1970, Cross was abducted at gunpoint from his British diplomatic residence at 1297 Redpath Crescent, in the Golden Square Mile district of Montreal, and held as a hostage for two months as the FLQ made a series of demands to the Quebec government. He was released on December 3 in exchange for safe passage for his abductors to Cuba.
