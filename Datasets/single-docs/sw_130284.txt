Commodore 64 Games System

Commodore 64 Games System (often abbreviated C64GS) was a cartridge based console made by Commodore International. It was Commodore's first console and was released in December 1990. It was a commercial failure because Commodore could not market the console properly due to its lack of games and the fact it was an 8-bit console in a 16-bit era.
