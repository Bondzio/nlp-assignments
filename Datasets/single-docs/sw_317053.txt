Carbon diet

Carbon diet is the process of reducing the production of greenhouse gas, primarily carbon dioxide, to reduce effects on climate change and global warming.

Carbon dioxide is produced from heating, driving and consuming products.

The production of carbon dioxide can be reduced by decreasing the intake of carbon, and eventually reduces the effects of climate change.

According to Deborah Jones, her family undergoes carbon diet. They are already in week two of the Globe and Mail assignment. The purpose of this assignment is to see how her family can reduces the emissions of greenhouse gas to reach the provincial goal of 33 percent reduction. It is different from a low carbon diet which is done by choosing what to eat to reduce greenhouse gas discharge.

There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.
