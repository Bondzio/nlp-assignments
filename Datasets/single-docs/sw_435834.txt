Monty Hall

Monte Halparin, OC, OM (born August 25, 1921) or Monty Hall is a Canadian television producer, actor, singer, comedian, and sportscaster. He is best known as host of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal".

Hall was born Monte Halparin in Winnipeg, Manitoba on August 25, 1921. He studied at St. John's High School. 

Since Hall was on "Let's Make a Deal," Hall's name is used in a probability puzzle known as the "Monty Hall problem", which examines the counter-intuitive effect of switching one's choice of doors, one of which hides a prize, if "Monty" reveals an unwanted item behind a door the player did not choose.

Monty married Marilyn Plottel in 1947. They had three children. Plottel died on June 5, 2017.
