The Simpsons Sing the Blues

The Simpsons Sing the Blues is an album of songs sung by the characters from "The Simpsons". The songs are not on the television series, except for "Moaning Lisa Blues". The album was released in early December 1990. It included many songs, including "Do the Bartman" and "Deep Deep Trouble". The most notable, however, was Lisa Simpson's version of "God Bless the Child" (originally by Billie Holiday). That song was a major hit during early 1991.
