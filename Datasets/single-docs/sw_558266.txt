Another book by Potocki, named "Moralia" is composed of more than 2 000 pieces, too. This was based on "Adagia" by Erasmus of Rotterdam. He wrote many poems, sometimes in ottava rima. His best known work is an epic poem "Wojna chocimska" ("The War of Chocim"). It was compared by Claude Backvis, a Belgian scholar, to John Milton's Paradise Lost. It narrates about the great battle against the Turks. The battle was fought in 1621, when the poet was born. The poem was written fifty years after. It is in heroic couplets. Lines of the poem consist of thirteen syllables with feminine rhymes.
