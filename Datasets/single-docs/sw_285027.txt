Chevrolet Cruze

The Chevrolet Cruze is a four-door Sedan and Hatchback car that is built by General Motors' Chevrolet brand. A subcompact Cruze based on the Suzuki Ignis was built between 2001 and 2008. Since 2008, the current compact has been produced as a replacement for the Chevrolet Cobalt. The Cruze is actually a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti Premiere, prior to its introduction, the original model was sold under Suzuki in America. Chevrolet Cruze is the only compact model to not have a Pontiac twin, instead it shares similarities with the new Buick Verano.

In the US, the Cruze is available with either a 1.8-liter or 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine producing 138 hp. Both are available with six-speed manual and automatic transmissions. GM has announced that in late 2016 a hatchback version of the Cruze will be offered in North America.
