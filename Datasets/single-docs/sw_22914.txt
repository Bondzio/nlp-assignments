Czechoslovakia

Czechoslovakia (Czech: "Československo", Slovak: "Československo"/after 1990 "Česko-Slovensko") was a country in Europe that existed from 1918 until 1993.

In mid 1938 Nazi Germany took over Czechoslovakia and split off Slovakia. After World War II the USSR kept part of eastern Czechoslovakia so that they could have a border with Hungary. The USSR also kept parts of Poland and Romania. All four of these countries were in the USSR's sphere of influence. The USSR thought that this meant they could make sure the countries did what they wanted. In 1968 the USSR thought that the government of Alexander Dubcek was moving away from communism and leaving the Warsaw Pact, and invaded Czechoslovakia.

In 1989 Czechoslovakia peacefully removed the Communist dictatorship in the "Velvet Revolution".

On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both countries separated in peace.
