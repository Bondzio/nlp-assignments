Evanescence EP

Evanescence is the first extended play released by American rock band Evanescence in 1998. It was written and recorded independently by singer Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody and featured guest appearances by a number of musicians.

The EP was independently released, and only 100 copies were made. They were sold during Evanescence's early live performances in Little Rock, Arkansas.

"Evanescence" consists of 7 tracks and features some of the first songs written and recorded for Evanescence. Some songs like "Imaginary" were further edited into different versions in later recordings by Evanescence.

The songs mostly consists of guitar, bass and drum instrumentation with simple piano lines. The song "Where Will You Go?" features organs in the background. The lyrics handle dark and sorrowful themes ranging from unrequited love in "Solitude" to running away from home in "Exodus".

Moody described the song "Understanding" as a "Cheesy 7-minute Goth anthem" and contains audio-clips from the movies "Terror in the Haunted House" and "When a Man Loves a Woman". The last track, titled "The End", features operatic vocals with the instrumental of the song "Solitude" playing in the background.

In a post in "EvThreads.com", Lee mentioned that despite the poor songwriting, there was a "magic" in Evanescence's earlier work, and continued "Each one was so exciting to us, we were just learning that we had the ability to make our favorite music".

The cover features the picture of the Steen Monument in Little Rock, which is a replica of the "Angel of Grief" sculpture by William Wetmore Story.
