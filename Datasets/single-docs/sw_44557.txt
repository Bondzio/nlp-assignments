Big Brother (TV series)

Big Brother is a TV reality show. People known as housemates, enter a house and they do not bring any of their belongings except clothes. They are bored and the people behind the cameras who call themselves Big Brother announce things through the loudspeaker. Housemates would get a task to do so that they can get food. There is also a celebrity version of Big Brother. 

The series was developed by Endemol, and the first season was shown in the Netherlands. The show's format has since been copied in over forty countries, including Brazil, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Spain, India, United Kingdom (see Big Brother UK 2008) and US. It also used to be in Australia, but was axed in 2008.

In some countries, there are also special editions of the show, for example "Big Brother VIP" or "". 
Usually, some of the rules in these special editions are a little bit different from the original ones.

"Big Brother VIP" is the name of the special edition of the show, in which all the housemates are famous people. It has been released in many of the countries airing "Big Brother", for example Bulgaria - "VIP Brother"; Mexico - "Big Brother VIP"; UK - "Celebrity Big Brother". 
The duration of the show is often only a month and in some countries the nominations and evictions are twice a week. 
Sometimes the big prize is given for charity or there is no big prize at all.
