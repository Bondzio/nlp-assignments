London Underground 1938 Stock

The London Underground 1938 Stock was a deep-level tube stock that ran on the London Underground from 1938 to 1988. During their long lives they worked on the Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, East London and Central lines. 

These trains do not run on the London Underground anymore. The trains were built by Metro-Cammell and Birmingham RC&W. Some of the trains still run on the Isle of Wight's Island Line as the class 483. In March 2007, South West Trains purchased the rolling stock outright from HSBC Rail for £1. They are the oldest trains used on timetabled services on the National Rail network.

The 1938 tube stock was built as part of the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works Programme, that took place between 1935–1940. The trains were mainly meant to be used on the Northern and Bakerloo lines. Seven more trains were also to be used on the Piccadilly line.

During the 1950s and 1960s the Northern Line only used 1938 and 1949 tube stock trains. These trains were starting to show how old they were by the late 1960s. The first trains were withdrawn from the Northern line in the early 1970s when they were replaced by the 1972 tube stock trains.
