Epistulae morales ad Lucillium

The Epistulae morales ad Lucilium (in English "Moral Letters to Lucilius") is the name for 124 letters Seneca the Younger wrote when he was old. All letters start ""Seneca Lucilio suo salutem"" (Seneca greets his Lucilius) and with "Vale" (Farewell). In the letters, Seneca gives Lucilius tips on how to become a better Stoic. Lucilius was the Governor of Sicily at the time, but he is only known through Seneca's writings. The letters treat different subjects, amongst others "On Noise" or "Asthma". Other letters are about "the influence of the masses" and "how to deal with one's slaves". Although they deal with Seneca's eclectic form of Stoic philosophy, they also give valuable insights into the daily life in ancient Rome.

The tag "Vita sine litteris mors" ('Life without learning [is] death') is adapted from "Epistle" 82 (originally "Otium sine litteris mors", 'Leisure without learning [is] death') and is the motto of Derby School and Derby Grammar School in England, Adelphi University, New York, and Manning's High School, Jamaica.
