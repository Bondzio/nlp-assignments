Shusha

Shusha also known as Shushi () is a town in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, in self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The city was also a major center of Armenian cultural and economic life until the World War I. Along with Tbilisi; it was one of the two main Armenian cities of the Transcaucasus and the center of a self-governing Armenian principality in the 1720s. It also had religious and strategic importance to the Armenians, housing the Ghazanchetsots Cathedral, the church of Kanach Zham and serving (along with Lachin district to the west) as a land link to Armenia. 

Shusha was founded in 1750-1752 (according to other sources, 1756-1757) by Panah-Ali khan Javanshir (r. 1748-1763), the founder and the first ruler of the independent. The first capital of the Karabakh khanate was castle of Bayat, built in 1748 in the district of Kebirli. However, soon afterwards Panah Ali khan realized that in order to secure himself and his newly-established khanate from external threats, and especially from the invasions from Iran, he needed to build a new more reliable castle. According to other sources, after serving as a town and an "ancient" fortress in the Armenian Principality of Varanda, Shusha was turned into the capital of the Karabakh khanate. 

Shusha was a popular mountainous-climatic recreation resort in the Soviet Union. After the anti-Armenian Shushi Massacres in 1920 it became the only large settlement in the Soviet autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh (1921-1991) with predominantly non-Armenian population. On May 8-9, 1992 the city was captured by Armenian armed forces.
