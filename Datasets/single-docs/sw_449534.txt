Satellite state

A satellite state is an officially independent country that is strongly influenced or controlled by another country. Examples of satellite states include Vichy France and Manchukuo. Both were satellite states during World War II. Sometimes the Warsaw Pact countries were called satellite states, but they had more freedom than most satellite states. Belarus is currently a satellite state of Russia.
