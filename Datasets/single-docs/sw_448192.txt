SKS

SKS is a Soviet Union made semi-automatic rifle. It was designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. In the 
1950s it was replaced with the AK-47. The SKS remained in second-line service for decades. It is still used as a ceremonial arm today. The SKS is currently popular in the civilian surplus market in many countries. This includes the United States, Canada and New Zealand. It was one of the first weapons designed to use the M-43 7.62Ã—39mm round, which was also used later in the AK-47.
