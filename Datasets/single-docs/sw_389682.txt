Pope Lando

Pope Lando (913-14) (; died 914) was the 122nd Pope from July or August in 913 until February or March in 914. 

Little is known about the short period during which Pope Lando was the head of the church.

Lando was to be the last pope with a name that was completely unique until Pope Francis's election. Since then, there has not been another pope with the name Lando.

Until Pope John Paul I in 1978, Pope Lando was the last pope to use a papal name which had not been used by an earlier pope.
