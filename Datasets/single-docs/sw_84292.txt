Asshole

Asshole (or arsehole in British English) is slang for the anus and is also used as a word to hurt people's feelings. It's made up from the word "arse", which has been used for a long time as another name for the anus. This was first added to the word "hole" about 1500 in books, but may have been used in talking a long time before that. By the 1970s, Hustler magazine featured people they did not like as "Asshole of the month."

Asshole is mainly used as a bad word towards someone that the speaker does not like. Men are often called asshole more than women, who are often called cunts instead.

You could not say "asshole" on normal television in the US until the early 1990s, but it was sometimes in PG-13 and R rated films before this.

In 2000, during a Labor Day event, George W. Bush made an off-hand remark to his running mate, Dick Cheney, that "New York Times" reporter Adam Clymer was a "major league asshole."

Gene Simmons of rock band Kiss released a solo album called "Asshole" which also featured a song of the same name. Denis Leary also had a song called "Asshole" in 1993. 

Words similar to "asshole" are "asshat", "assclown", "asstard", "asspat" and "asspit".
