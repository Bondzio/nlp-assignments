Kaulaulaokalani

Kaulaulaokalani (Ka-ʻulaʻula-o-kalani) was a Hawaiian nobleman, who lived on the island of Oahu. He was the High Chief of Koʻolau. Part of his name — "o ka lani" — means "one of the sky". He was a ruler of Koʻolau, while his relatives Lakona and Maelo ruled over other parts of the island.

He was a son of the Chief Kawalewaleoku and his wife Unaʻula and he succeeded his father, who was considered a deity. Kaulaulaokalani's wife was called Kalua-i-Olowalu, and they had a daughter, Kaimihauoku, who ruled over Koʻolau after her father's death. A grandson of Kaulaulaokalani's was Moku-o-Loe.
