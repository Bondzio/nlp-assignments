Ernst Zündel

Ernst Christof Friedrich Zündel (April 24, 1939 —August 5, 2017) was a German publisher and pamphleteer known for promoting Holocaust denial. He had been jailed several times: in Canada for publishing literature "likely to incite hatred against an identifiable group", and on charges of being a threat to national security; in the United States, for overstaying his visa; and in Germany for charges of "inciting racial hatred".

Zündel died at his home in Germany, of a suspected heart attack, on August 5, 2017.
