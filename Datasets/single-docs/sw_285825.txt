Highwayman

A highwayman was a type of robber who attacked people who were travelling. Highwaymen often rode on horses. They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I through to the 1800s. 

Some highwaymen robbed alone but others worked in gangs. They often targeted coaches because they did not have much defence, stealing money, jewellery and other valuable items. The penalty for robbery with violence was to be executed by hanging. 

One of the most famous highwaymen was Dick Turpin, who was hanged for his crimes in 1739. Ben Hall was said to be one too.
