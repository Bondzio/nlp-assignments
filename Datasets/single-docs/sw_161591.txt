Mr Blobby

Mr Blobby is a fictional character from the BBC1 television programme "Noel's House Party". He was a large pink "blob" covered with yellow spots. Mr Blobby had a toothy grin and eyes. He communicated by saying the word "blobby" in an electronically-changed voice. His moods were shown by changes in the tone of his voice and repetition.
