Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is a NASA spacecraft. It launched August 12, 2005 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and arrived at Mars on March 10, 2006. It went into orbit around Mars, and has been studying the planet since then. The main area of study is looking for water on Mars, under the surface of Mars, and in the atmosphere (air around Mars). To do this, it has the largest telescope ever sent to another planet. It also works as a communications satellite. Its powerful antennas send and receive messages between NASA on Earth, and rovers on the surface of Mars.
