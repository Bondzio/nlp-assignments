A.C. Milan

A.C. Milan is an Italian football club in Milan.

They were started in 1899 by two Englishmen, Herbet Kilpin and Alfred Edwards after a heavy drinking session in the Fiaschetteria Toscana tavern in Milan.

Herbet Kilpin became the first team coach and captain whilst Alfred Edwards became the first club president.

Their first name was Milan Cricket and Football Club. They have won the Serie A football league 18 times and the Coppa Italia football cup 5 times. They have won more things than any Italian club except for Juventus. In season 2005/06 they were punished for setting up the results. They started the 2006/07 season with an 8-point deficit, but they managed to end up fourth and win the UEFA Champions League qualification games. A.C.Milan won the 2006/07 UEFA Champions League in the final at Athens versus Liverpool. 2 to 1 was the score for the Italian team.

They play at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, also known as San Siro because Giuseppe Meazza was a star playing for arch rival, Internazionale Milano in Milan.
