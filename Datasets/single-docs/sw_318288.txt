Brown asbestos

Brown asbestos, also called grunerite or amosite, is one of the six types of asbestos. It has the chemical formula FeSiO(OH). It is less common than white asbestos but can be found in some construction materials. Like other types of asbestos, being exposed to it can cause mesothelioma and asbestosis.
