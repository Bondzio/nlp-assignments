Annihilation

Annihilation is the name given to the process that occurs when a particle and its antiparticle equivalent collide. The collision between these two particles makes energy release. Two types of this include the annihilation of electrons and positrons (the antiparticle for electrons), and the annihilation of protons and antiprotons.
