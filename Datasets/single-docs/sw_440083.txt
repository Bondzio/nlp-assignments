Haikouichthys

Haikouichthys is an extinct early fish-like craniate.

These creatures have backbones and distinct heads, and lived about 530 million years ago, during the Cambrian explosion. 

"Haikouichthys" had a defined skull and other characters which suggest it is a true craniate, and perhps one of the earliest fishes. Cladistic analysis indicates that the animal is probably a basal chordate or a basal craniate. It does not show enough detail to be definitely included in either stem group.
