South African Republic

The South African Republic (Dutch: "Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek", ZAR), often informally called the Transvaal Republic, was a sovereign state in southern Africa ruled by the Afrikaners. It was defeated by the UK and its colonies, the British Cape Colony and the Colony of Natal in the Second Boer War and became the British colony of Transvaal.
