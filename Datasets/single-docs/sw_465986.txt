Interstate 95 in Connecticut

Interstate 95 is the main north-south Interstate Highway on the East Coast of the United States. It runs in a general east-west compass direction for 111.57 miles (179.55 km) in Connecticut. The majority of the road, west (south) of the New London area, is part of the Connecticut Turnpike. This is connected to the New England Thruway in New York state. I-95 leaves the Turnpike west of New London, and continues east through that city towards Westerly, Rhode Island rather than turning north with the Turnpike (designated Interstate 395).
