Neoarchaean

The Neoarchaean (Neoarchean) is the last geological era in the Archaean eon. It began 2.8 billion years ago and ended at 2.5 billion years ago. Before it was the Mesoarchaean and before the Palaeoproterozoic. 

Oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved in this era. This led to an oxygen catastrophe in the Palaeoproterozoic. It was caused by a poisonous buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere. This was created by oxygen-producing photoautotrophs that evolved in the Neoarchaean. The supercontinent Kenorland formed during this period, about 2.7 billion years ago.
