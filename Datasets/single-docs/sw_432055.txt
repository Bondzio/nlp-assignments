Division of Reid

The Division of Reid is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It is named after the Right Honourable Sir George Reid, a former Premier of New South Wales and the fourth Prime Minister of Australia. Ot was set up in 1922.

The division is in the inner-western suburbs of Sydney. It includes Abbotsford, Breakfast Point, Cabarita, Canada Bay, Chiswick, Concord, Concord West, Drummoyne, Five Dock, Homebush, Homebush West, Liberty Grove, Lidcombe, Mortlake, Newington, North Strathfield, Rhodes, Rodd Point, Russell Lea, Silverwater, Sydney Olympic Park, Wareemba, and Wentworth Point; and includes parts of Auburn, Berala, Burwood, Croydon, and Strathfield.

In 2009 the Australian Electoral Commission proposed that the division be abolished. The name "Reid" was kept for a division which included most of the old Division of Lowe, with part of the old Division of Reid.

Members for the division have included Jack Lang, a former Premier of New South Wales; Tom Uren, a minister in Whitlam and Hawke governments; and Laurie Ferguson, the son of Jack Ferguson who was a Deputy Premier of New South Wales, and the brother of Martin Ferguson, a former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments.
