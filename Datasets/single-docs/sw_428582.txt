Jack Daniel

Jasper Newton "Jack" Daniel (September 5, 1850 â€“ October 10, 1911) was an American distiller and the founder of Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey.

Daniel died from an infectious case of blood poisoning at Lynchburg in 1911. The infection allegedly set up originally in a toe, which Daniel injured in kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open early one morning at work. He always had trouble remembering the combination.
