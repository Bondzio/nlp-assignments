Procompsognathus

Procompsognathus was a small, speedy theropod dinosaur. This meat-eater lived during the late Triassic period, about 210 million years ago (mya). It probably ate insects and lizards in a relatively dry, inland environment. 

"Procompsognathus" may have been about one meter long (3.3Â ft), 

A biped, "Procompsognathus" had long hind legs, short arms, large clawed hands, a long slender snout with many small teeth, and a stiff tail. The tibia is approximately 20% longer than the femur in "Procompsognathus". This suggests that they were good runners.
