Spaghetti strap tank top

A Spaghetti strap tank top is a sleeveless shirt that has very thin straps supporting it. It is typically worn by girls and women. The name comes from the very thin straps, which are almost the thickness of spaghetti.

Spaghetti strap tank tops have been banned at many schools and other formal places. There has been an increased concern that girls may attempt to wear only a tank top as a way to be sexy - showing off their bra strap or even their breasts.
