Syed Ahmed Khan

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan CSI (; (October 17, 1817 – 27 March 1898) was a teacher and politician. He was also a social reformer. He founded the school that would later become Aligarh Muslim University. 

In 1857 there was a rebellion in India. This is known as the First Indian War of Independence. During this time, Sir Syed kept loyal to the British; He also saved many European lives. After the rebellion he wrote a book where he said the British were in fact those who caused the rebellion.In order to settle the question of whether Sir Syed was a communitarian or a communalist, we need to assess the speeches and articles which he wrote.

According to Sir Syed, Muslims had to bring a positive approach to the British and accept their ways of education. He wanted the Muslims to benefit from the British. To achieve this task he had to bring about cooperation between the Muslims and the British. To do this he did the following things:

However it later proved to be functioning only for the Hindus and tried to eradicate the Muslims. The Congress made three demands:

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan played a vital role in improving the Muslim status. He worked tirelessly to restore relations between the Muslims and the British.
