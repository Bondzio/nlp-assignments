Arthur Sarkissian

Arthur Sarkissian (born 11 May 1960) is an Armenian artist and painter. He is one of the top twelve artists working now in Armenia.

Sarkissian was born in 1960 in Gyumri, Armenia and went to the School of Fine Arts there in 1977, then the Armenian Pedagogical University (Drawing) in 1989. He now lives and works in the city of Yerevan in Armenia.

Sarkissian creates abstract art to show and enjoy the post-soviet freedom in Armenia. In 2005 he said that his way of painting was because he wanted to free himself from "Socialist Realism"." His paintings put together oil paint, silkscreen printing, words, photographs and parts of other paintings, and other materials.

His work can be seen in the Public Collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Yerevan. Many private collections of art across the world also include his paintings.
