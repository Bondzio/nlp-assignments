Alexandra Frantseva

Alexandra Frantseva (born 24 April 1987) is a skier from Russia. She has a disability: she cannot see everything. She skied at the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships. She was the second skier to finish in the women's visually impaired Super-G race, Giant slalom race and Super Combined race, and the third skier to finish the women's visually impaired downhill race and slalom race. Because she cannot see, Evgenia Kolosovskaya was her guide and told her where to go when going down the mountain.
