Argo Navis

Argo Navis is a constellation in the southern sky. In the past, it represented the ship of Jason and his argonauts who were in search of the Golden Fleece. Today, it is no longer seen as one constellation but is divided instead into three smaller ones. These are Puppis (the stern), Carina (the keel) and Vela (the sails). It is visible mainly in the southern hemisphere. If it were still recognized today it would be the biggest constellation in the sky.
