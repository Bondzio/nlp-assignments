Yuki people

The Yuki are a Native American group of California. Their traditional territory is around Round Valley, in what is now Mendocino County. The Yuki call themselves the Ukomno'm, meaning "Valley People." European Americans learned and adopted the name "Yuki" from the their neighbours, the Nomlaki, who called them "enemy" in the Wintu language. "Yuki" is an exonym, a name by another group.
