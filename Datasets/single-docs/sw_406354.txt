The Slave's Friend

The Slave's Friend was a 19th-century American monthly children's magazine. It was published in New York City, New York by the American Anti-Slavery Society beginning in 1835 and ending some time before 1839. 

Thirty-eight issues were published. Single copies cost 1 cent, but the magazine was made available in public places for free. The 16-page, tiny magazine (4.5" h x 2.75") was considered dangerous reading by anti-abolitionists. Copies were destroyed in Charleston, South Carolina and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
