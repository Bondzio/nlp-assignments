Propulsion tools

Propulsion is the use of force to make movement. 

For ground propulsion the first instrument was the wheel.

For water propulsion pole, paddle, oar and sail have been used. Nowadays the most common types are underwater propellers. Sails are still common, and historically represented the most important form of early propulsion for large ships. 

For air propulsion, the most common types are propeller and jet engine. Others have been used experimentally.
