Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan

Politically, Azerbaijan is divided into these administrative divisions:

This list is for the main part of Azerbaijan. The rayons of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are listed below and numbered separately. Some rayons are completely or partially in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, shown on the map in green; this is noted in the list. Nagorno-Karabakh is not recognised as an independent state, but it functions as one.

The rayons are further divided into municipalities.

The territory of Nagorno-Karabakh currently is made up of the rayons of Khojavend, Tartar, Goranboy, Shusha and Kalbajar. When the area was part of the Soviet Union, it was known as Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO). However, on 26 November 1991, the Parliament of the Azerbaijan SSR ended the autonomy of the NKAO. Its territory was divided between the neighboring rayons. Since the Nagorno-Karabakh War, however, it is under the control of the ethnic Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.

The seven districts and one municipality of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are listed and numbered separately.
