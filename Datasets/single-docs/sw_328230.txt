Bass (vocal range)

A bass is a type of male singing voice and possesses the lowest vocal range of all voice types. According to "The New Grove Dictionary of Opera", a bass is typically classified as having a range extending from around the second E below middle C to the E above middle C (i.e., E2â€“E4). Its tessitura, or comfortable range, is normally defined by the outermost lines of the bass clef.
