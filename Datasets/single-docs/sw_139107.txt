Volvo V40

Volvo V40 was a car produced by Volvo from 1995 through 2004. It was an estate version of the first generation S40. It was replaced by the V50 after Volvo revamped the S40 and stopped making it.

In 2012 Volvo introduced a new car called "Volvo V40". It is a totally new designed car and it shares nothing but it's name with the older car.
