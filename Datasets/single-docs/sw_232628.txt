Winchester College football

Winchester College football, also known as Wincofo or winkies, is a style of football that is played at Winchester College during the spring term or ""common time,"" as the Winchester students refer to it. It was originally played during the autumn term, or ""short half."" It is very similar to games played at other public schools such as Eton's wall game and Harrow game. The school is located in the city of Winchester in Hampshire, England. 

It was originally played down Kingsgate Street, a long street that runs parallel to the college. However, there were very few rules. The only thing that has not changed is that the canvas (the pitch it is played on) is the same measurement as the part of the street it was originally played on.

Nobody knows when the game location was moved. However after a while it was moved away from the town to the grassland on the top of St. Catherine's Hill. To stop the ball from going into the canal that is below, they used junior men from the college to go fetch it when it was not caught by the players. To some extent, this continues to be in the game because there are classmates used as watchers to catch stray balls. However, there were problems with this. The biggest is the lines of watchers were depleted due to players being too enthusiastic and colliding with each other, causing injuries. So they introduced ropes to mark out the border of the playing field. These are now essential tactics of the game.
