Good Kid, M.A.A.D City

Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City (written as good kid, m.A.A.d city) is the second studio album by Kendrick Lamar. It was released on October 22, 2012 through Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Records and Interscope Records. After the release of Lamar's mixtape "Overly Dedicated" (2010), Dr. Dre quickly sighned him to his record label Aftermath.

The lyrics are about Lamar's childhood, living in Compton. He experienced gang violence and the use of drugs, which left him stuck on that type of style. It was supported by several singles, including: "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe", "Swimming Pools (Drank)", "Money Trees", "Backseat Freestyle", "m.A.A.d. city", and "The Recipe". Other musicians featured on the album include Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Schoolboy Q, MC E, Black Hippy, Jay Rock and Drake.
