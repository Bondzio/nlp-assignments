Defensive tackle

A defensive tackle is a position in the center of the defensive line in American and Canadian football. These are some of the largest players (in size) on the field. Their main jobs are to occupy offensive linemen, tackle, and make it hard for the quarterback to throw the ball. They rarely do anything else. In the National Football League, defensive tackles may wear numbers in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 90s, but may wear any number they chose in college football.
