Michigan State University

Michigan State University (or "MSU" for short) is a public university in East Lansing, Michigan.

The Michigan State Spartans are the athletic team of the university. The school's athletic program includes 23 varsity sports teams. The school colors are green and white. They play in NCAA Division I, with almost all of their teams playing in the Big Ten Conference. In 2010, the MSU football team won a share of the Big 10 title, and played in the Capital One Bowl in Orlando, Florida. The men's ice hockey team plays in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, but will leave that conference in July 2013 when the Big Ten starts a men's hockey league.

Established in 1855, MSU was originally an agricultural college. Students were known as "Aggies," but are now known as the "Spartans." Currently, Michigan State University has the largest single campus student body of any university in the state of Michigan, and is one of the largest universities in the country.

The mascot of the university is called "Sparty". He is mostly shown as a muscular male Spartan warrior/athlete dressed in a stylish Greek costume.
