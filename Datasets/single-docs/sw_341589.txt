Mutunus Tutunus

In ancient Roman religion, Mutunus Tutunus was a phallic marriage deity. He is often associated with the Greek god Priapus. His shrine was located on the Velian Hill, supposedly since the founding of Rome, until the 1st century BC.

During marriage rites, Roman brides are supposed to have straddled the phallus of Mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse, according to Church Fathers who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of virginity.
