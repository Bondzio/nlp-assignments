HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed

Histadrut HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed (, lit. "The Federation of Working and Studying Youth"), sometimes abbreviated to No'al () is an Israeli youth movement, a sister movement of Habonim Dror. The movement was founded in 1924 by youth working to defend their rights. The first name of the movement was "Hanoar HaOved" ("The Working Youth") and it was connected to the Histadrut (Isarali workers union). in 1959 it was connected with "HaTnua HaMeu'he'det" (, "The United Movement") and the name was changed to HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed.

In the 1990s, along with the decline of the kibbutz movement, HaNoar HaOved VeHalomed began re-examining the ideal life path of its members, which had always began settling kibbutzim in "gar'inim" after finishing their mandatory period of army service. Instead, a model started to be put forward in which "bogrim" ("graduates") of the movement formed small urban communes working in society, particularly in education. Today, there are about 1,000 members of HaNoar HaOved VeHalomed's "Tnuat Bogrim" ("Movement of Graduates") living in small communes in cities or kibbutzim and working in Israeli Society - mostly in education and the youth movement. The youth movement and the "Tnuat Bogrim" are called "Dror-Israel" movement, which is named after the historical "Dror" movement in Europe.

Some of the graduates of the movement have become a parliament members, such as Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Moshe Ya'alon.

The movement aims that each member aspires to the following goals:
