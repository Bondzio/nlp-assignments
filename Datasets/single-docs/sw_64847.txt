Low pressure area

A low pressure area, or low for short, is a word used in meteorology (the study of weather) that means a place where the atmospheric pressure is lowest compared to the surrounding area. Storms like tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, subtropical cyclones, and subpolar cyclones are called "low-pressure cells" in some English-speaking countries.
