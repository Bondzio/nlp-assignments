Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile

La Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, usually called the FIA, is a non-profit association established as the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR) on June 20, 1904 to represent the interests of motoring organisations and motor car users. Most people know the FIA as the governing body for motor racing events. 

Headquartered at 8, Place de la Concorde, Paris, the FIA has 213 national member organisations in 125 countries worldwide. Its current president is Max Mosley. 

As is the case with football's FIFA, the FIA is generally known by its French name and acronym, even in English-speaking countries, but is sometimes called the "International Automobile Federation".
