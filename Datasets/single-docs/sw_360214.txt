Jim'll Fix It

Jim'll Fix It was a long-running British television show. It was broadcast by the BBC between 1975 and 1994. In 2007 it was shown on UKTVGold. It was presented by the late Jimmy Savile. It was produced by Roger Ordish, who also worked on other BBC shows, including A Bit of Fry & Laurie. When Saville was knighted, the book for the 1991 series of the comedy sketch show had a statement that in future "Jim'll Fix It" would be known as: "Sir James will bring his influence to bear in arranging matters to your satisfaction."
