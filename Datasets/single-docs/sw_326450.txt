Water treatment

Water treatment is treating water to make it suitable to be used. Providing drinking water is one of the main uses of water treatment. 

Many factories also need very clean water to make steam or to make high quality products. Some of this water has to be made very pure with almost no other chemicals dissolved in it.

Treating sewage so that it does not cause harm to the environment is another use of water treatment.
