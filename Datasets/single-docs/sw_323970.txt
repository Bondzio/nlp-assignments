In 1284 he became a member od general council, together with Brunetto Latini and Dino Compagni. On June 24 1300 he was exiled, so he went to Sarzana. On August 19 of the same year he could return in Florence, but he died after a few days, on August 29.

Guido Cavalcanti wrote sonnets and ballads. Only fifty two poems by the poet are known today. Hist best works are the canzone "Donna mi prega" ("A lady asks me"), the ballad "I' prego voi che di dolor parlate" ("I ask you that speak about suffering") and the sonnet "L’anima mia vilment’ è sbigotita" ("My soul is in distress").

Cavalcanti's poems were translated into English by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ezra Pound and A.S. Kline.
