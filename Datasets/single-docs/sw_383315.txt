Scotland national cricket team

The Scotland national cricket team is Scotland's team in the game of cricket. They compete in the "Clydesdale Bank 40" as the Scottish Saltires. The Scottish Saltires play their home matches at The Grange, Edinburgh.

They were invited as member of the International Cricket Council in 1994. The team were unable to qualify for the World Cup in 2003.

In 2004 the Scotland cricket team played in the first "ICC Intercontinental Cup". They played against Ireland and the Netherlands to progress to the semi-finals in Sharjah. They won against Kenya in the semi-finals, and then won the Cup by beating Canada in the final. They also competed in that tournament in 2005, but failed to get past the first round.

Scotland played their first One Day International matches outside of World Cups against Pakistan in June 2006, with the European Championship matches against Ireland and the Netherlands during August.

Gordon Drummond has captained the side since 2010, and their coach is Peter Steindl from Australia.
