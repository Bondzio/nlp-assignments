Larry Johnson

Larry Johnson (born November 19, 1979) is a former American Football runningback in the National Football League. He played college football for Penn State.

Johnson spent most of his career with the Kansas City Chiefs. After replacing the often-injured veteran Priest Holmes, Johnson excelled. He played very well in 2005 and 2006 and far passed the 1,000 yard mark that notable backs and receivers aim for. However, after an argument with head coach Todd Haley in 2009, he was released. He finished the season with the Cincinnati Bengals, but was not resigned.

Johnson spent portions of offseasons with the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins, but was cut both times.
