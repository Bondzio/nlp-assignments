Chordate

Chordata is a phylum (group) of animals which have a notochord. The group includes vertebrates, with some closely related invertebrates.


Note: Lines show likely evolutionary relationships. Extinct groups are marked with a "â€ ". Extinct animals are ones that are not around anymore, but around in the past.

A long-standing theory is that in transformed larvae of sea-squirts (tunicates) lies the origin of chordates. Adult tunicates are sessile, but their larvae are motile, and have some features found in early vertebrates. The process of paedomorphosis, where juvenile features are retained in the adult, is the proposed mechanism. Genome analysis does show that the tunicates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates.
