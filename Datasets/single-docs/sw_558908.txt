Partial fraction decomposition

Partial fraction decompositionÂ is taking a big algebra fraction and splitting it into a bunch of smaller fractions that are added together. Partial fractions are used to get the antiderivatives of algebra fractions.

In math writing, we're turning this:

formula_1

Into this:

formula_2

The denominators of all these fractions are factors of g(x).
