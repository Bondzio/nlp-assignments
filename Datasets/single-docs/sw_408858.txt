Bernard Gay Marshall was born in North Easton, Massachusetts. His father was named Francis F. Marshall. His mother was named Helen F. Doten Marshall. He lived in North Easton until he grew up. He always wanted to be a writer who made up stories. He did not think he could earn much money by making up stories, so he worked at other jobs. Some of those jobs were playing music, writing down the words that people said when they talked about the law, and writing to tell people about how machines worked or about things that they could buy. During World War I he worked at making ships. In July 1903, Bernard Gay Marshall married Ida M. Conklin. They had one daughter. Her name was Harriet C. Marshall.
Bernard Gay Marshall wrote five adventure stories for children and young adults. He also wrote a lot of short stories and nonfiction articles for magazines. Some of these magazines were "Sunset", "Boys' Life", "St Nicholas", "Munsey's Magazine", "The American Magazine", and "The American Boy".
His first book, "Cedric the Forester", was made a Newbery Medal Honor Book in 1922. Some people said that Bernard Marshall's books were as good as Sir Walter Scott's books, but other people said they were not quite that good. A lot of people said that his books were so good that grown-ups and children should all read them.
All of these books were published by D. Appleton, and the pictures were drawn by J. Scott Williams.
