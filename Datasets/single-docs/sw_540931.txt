Assyrian calendar

The Assyrian calendar is a lunar-based calendar that begins in the year 4750 BC.  The Assyrian calendar is inspired by an estimate of the date of the first temple at Assur. The Assyrian new year is still celebrated every year by many people. This calendar is official among ethnic Assyrians in Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Armenia, Jordan, Lebanon, parts of Turkey and Iran.

This calendar begins 4,750 years before the Gregorian calendar. For example, it is set out like this: 2016+4750 = Assyrian year 6766.
