Christianity and homosexuality

Various Christian denominations are negative about homosexuality, like the Catholic Church, Eastern Christianity, Orthodox Protestant churches, and sects like Mormonism.

They consider homosexuality and other forms of LGBT activities as sinful and contradictory with God's purpose in creating people. God created man and woman (Adam and Eve), and only they are allowed to have sexual intercourse, and only within marriage (no same-sex marriage). For that reason homosexuality is considered a severe sin in the Bible, as stated for example in the Book of Leviticus and the Epistle to the Romans.

Especially in Evangelical denominations the increase of LGBT activities in modern times is subscribed to the approaching end time when evil will reach its highest point.

Liberal Christian denominations and some (less) Orthodox Protestant churches have more or less accepted LGBT activities.
