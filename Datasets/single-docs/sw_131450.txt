Of Mice and Men

Of Mice and Men is a novella (short novel) written by John Steinbeck. It was published in 1937. The story is a tragedy about two ranch workers called George Milton and Lennie Small. It takes place in the 1930s, in California, United States.

They were both born in Auburn, California

The book is based on Steinbeck's experiences of being a ranch worker. The title of the book is taken from a poem by Robert Burns called "To a Mouse". When the novella was published, it was very popular and it became a best seller. It was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club. "Of Mice and Men" is often banned in schools because of the bad language, racism, questionable morality and violence. It is on the American Library Association's list of the "Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century".


"Of Mice and Men" is a story about friendship and loneliness. It also talks about the American Dream: the hope that in America, anyone can become rich or famous if they work hard.
