Donkey punch

The donkey punch is an act during sexual intercourse. Some people wrongly think that if a man putting his penis in his partner's vagina or anus punches their back or head, the vagina and anus will become very tight, giving more pleasure to the man. In fact, no such reflex exists. In 2004, the pornography actress Gia Paloma was the first person to person to receive a donkey punch in a film.
