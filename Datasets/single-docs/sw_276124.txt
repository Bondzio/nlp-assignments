Arsenic pentoxide

Arsenic pentoxide, also known as arsenic(V) oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AsO. It has arsenic and oxide ions in it. The arsenic is in its +5 oxidation state. More common is arsen in its oxidation state +3 as AsO (arsenic trioxide or arsenic(III) oxide). The LD50 for arsenic pentoxide is 8mg/kg for rats. When the substance becomes wet, it turns into arsenic acid, which corrodes metals.

Arsenic pentoxide is a white, odourless solid. It dissolves easily in water to make arsenic acid. It is highly toxic, as are almost all arsenic compounds. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine. AsO breaks down to arsenic trioxide and oxygen when heated to about 300Â°C. 

It reacts with bases to make arsenates. The energy for the reaction is taken from the heating.

Arsenic pentoxide cannot be produced by burning arsen. That only results in AsO. To produce arsenic pentoxid, arsenic acid will be dehydrated. This is done with phosphorus(V) oxide.

The arsenic pentoxide drops out as white powder.

Arsenic pentoxide is used to make pesticides and insecticides. It is also used in glass industry.
