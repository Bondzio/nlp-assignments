Harpy eagle

The harpy eagle ("Harpia harpyja") is one of the largest eagles and most powerful birds of prey in the world. It is a magnificent meat-eater that lives in Central and South American rainforests. 

This large eagle makes whistling and clicking calls. It is an endangered species because of the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat through logging, and also because of hunting.
