La Tène culture

The La Tène culture is a culture that lasted from about 500 BC to about 100 AD. It is named after the city of "La Tène" (today, Marin-Epagnier, next to Neuchâtel). It was influenced a lot by the Roman and Greek cultures. There are two sources for this:
The Celts basically lived in clans. These were led by leaders, the Druids and Bards. Women were much better off than with the Romans, they were factually equal to men. There was Polygyny and Polyandry (A man could have several women, a woman could have several men).
