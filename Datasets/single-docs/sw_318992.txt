Voting age

Voting age is the age when a person is allowed to vote in political elections by governments. The majority of countries set it at 18, but ages ranging from 16 to 21 exist. Iran is the only sovereignty to ever have a voting age below 16 in recent history, setting it at 15 until it was raised to 18 recently. When the voting age was first established it was usually set at 21, but in the latter half of the twentieth century most countries, including the United States, lowered it to 18. A few jurisdictions today, such as Austria and the Isle of Man, have lowered it to 16.
