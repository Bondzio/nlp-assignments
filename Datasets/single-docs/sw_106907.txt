MP3 player

An MP3 player is a portable audio device people can use to listen to songs saved in the MP3 format. They can use USB cords or Wi-Fi to connect the device to computers, so that computer files can be transferred to players internal memory. MP3s are audio files that have been made smaller by removing sounds that the human ear cannot hear. Many newer MP3 players can also be used to view images or movies, or play games. The most well-known MP3 player is the iPod.
