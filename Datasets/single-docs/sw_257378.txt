Conker's Bad Fur Day

Conker's Bad Fur Day is a platform game for the Nintendo 64 that was developed and published by Rare and distributed by Nintendo in 2001. It is the sequel to the Game Boy Color game, "Conker's Pocket Tales". This game was in development for four years and was originally going to be entitled "Conker's Quest", and then "Twelve Tails: Conker 64". This game was going to be rated "E" until Rare changed it to an "mature" game, due to thinking they would be mocked as people call it a cutesy game. After the change, Conker was not a cutesy character anymore, drinks too much beer, and becomes a greedy squirrel.

This game later received a remake for the Xbox in 2005 known as "".
