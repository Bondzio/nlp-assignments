Abu Nidal

Abu Nidal () (May 1937 – 16 August 2002), born Sabri Khalil al-Banna (), was the founder of Fatah – The Revolutionary Council (), a militant Palestinian separatist group also known as the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO). At the height of his power in the 1970s and 1980s, Abu Nidal was mostly known as the most merciless of the Palestinian political leaders. He told "Der Spiegel" in a rare interview in 1985: "I am the evil spirit which moves around only at night causing ... nightmares."
