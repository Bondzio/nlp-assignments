Light Rail Transit Association

The Light Rail Transit Association (LRTA) is an association. Its purpose is to help and encourage research to keep and develop of light rail and tramway/streetcar systems. The LRTA publishes the monthly magazine "Tramways and Urban Transit" (formerly "Modern Tramway"). It is based in the United Kingdom but it has an international membership and remit. 

The LRTA was formed in 1937. It was called Light Railway Transport League (LRTL) until 1979. 

The opening of the Tyne and Wear Metro in 1980, followed by the Manchester Metrolink in 1991 and other new tram systems in Sheffield, , Croydon and Nottingham, are very much in line with the aims of the Association.
