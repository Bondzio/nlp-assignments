Division of Fremantle

The Division of Fremantle is an Australian Electoral Division in Western Australia. It was one of the original 75 divisions for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the city of Fremantle, which in turn is named for Captain Charles Fremantle. Fremantle was captain of HMS "Challenger", which brought the first settlers to Western Australia. The Division includes the southern suburbs of Perth, Cockburn, Coolbellup, Palmyra, Fremantle and Rottnest Island.

The division originally included Perth's southwestern suburbs. Boundary changes since 1949 have made it a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party.

Many senior Labor members have held Fremantle. The most famous was John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia from 1941 to 1945.Others were Kim Beazley (senior), a minister in the Whitlam Government; John Dawkins, a minister in the Hawke Government and Keating Governments; and Carmen Lawrence, the former Premier of Western Australia and a minister in the Keating Government.
