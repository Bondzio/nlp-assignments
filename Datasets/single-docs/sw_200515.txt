Earplug

An ear plug is a device usually used to protect the ears from loud noises. They are put inside the ear canal and can also be used to protect the ear from water, dust or anything that doesn't belong in the ear.

Ear plugs are made using many different materials to be used for different reasons. 


Ear plugs are also made to be re-used or disposable.
