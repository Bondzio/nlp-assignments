2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt

A coup d'état attempt took place in Turkey on 15 July 2016, when a group of people tried to take over the government because they disagreed with the way the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is running the country. It is believed that most of these people were from the Turkish army. Over 100 people were killed and over 1,000 injured. Thousands of soldiers were arrested because they joined the rebellion or for other reasons. Hundreds fled to Greece or other foreign countries. Thousands of teachers, judges and other government employees were fired in the 2016 Turkish purges.
