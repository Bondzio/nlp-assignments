Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels

Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a Mario video game made by Nintendo. It was released as "Super Mario Bros. 2" in Japan in 1986 for the Famicom Disk System. Nintendo of America took another game, called "Doki Doki Panic", and released that instead under the "Super Mario Bros. 2" name.

"The Lost Levels" was not released in the United States since Nintendo of America felt that Americans would not be happy with the game because they felt it was too hard and it was too similar to "Super Mario Bros".
"The Lost Levels" feature updated graphics from the original, new items, and new functions. 


Mario and Luigi now act differently. Luigi has a higher jump and skids more when coming to a stop.

The game was first released around the world in 1993 in "Super Mario All-Stars" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game console. That game had the other three "Super Mario Bros." games with better graphics and a save function.

Since then, it has been re-released three more times.
