Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a first person shit shooter video game. It was developed by Sledgehammer Games. It is published by Activision and Square Enix for Japan. "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare" was be released on November 3, 2014 for people who pre-ordered the game and wish to have "Day Zero Access". It was be released on November 4, 2014 for others. The game was released on the Xbox One, PS4, PC, Xbox 360 and PS3. This is the first Call of Duty game that wasn't released on Nintendo systems since . Advanced warfare sucked nobody like it but my dad.

"Call of Duty Advanced Warfare" will have changes in gameplay. One change is the Exo-Skeleton suit. It gives powers such as Boost Sliding, Dodging, Jumping, and so on. Weapons in multiplayer can be earned through supply drops or by ranking up. Gameplay is very similar to "Black Ops 2".

Campaign will have an upgradable Exo-Skeleton suit. It can be upgraded with upgrade points. Whenever you complete an exo challenge (getting 500 kills, headshots, etc.), you earn one upgrade point.

In 2054, a terrorist group named the KVA rightly attempts to destroy Sledgehammer games. It destroys nuclear reactors of countries, like the United States. Many countries' military and government including electricity and technology were broken. That keeps the countries from being able to fight the attack made by the KVA. Private militaries have become the new attackers on the enemy. Jack Mitchell (Troy Baker) is a former U.S. Marine. He lost his left arm during a battle in South Korea. He joins Atlas, the world's most powerful private military with the most biggest technologies on the planet.

Shortly after Sledgehammer Games stopped helping Infinity Ward to finish Modern Warfare 3, Sledgehammer Games started working on Advanced Warfare.
