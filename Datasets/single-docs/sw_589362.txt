En Marche!

En Marche! (; English translation: "Forward!", "Onward!", "Working!" or "On The Move!") is a centrist and liberal political party in France. It was founded on 6 April 2016 by Emmanuel Macron, a former Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs, who was later elected President of France in the 2017 presidential election by a landslide 66.1% of the second-round vote.

The party ran candidates in the 2017 legislative elections as La RÃ©publique En Marche! (English translation: "The Republic Onwards!"), including members of the Democratic Movement, as well as dissidents from the Socialist Party, The Republicans and minor parties. It won an absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly, securing 308 under its label and 42 for the MoDem.

Macron thinks En Marche! to be a progressive movement, uniting both the left and the right.
