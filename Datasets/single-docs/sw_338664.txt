Kushan Empire

The Kushan Empire ( ("Kuṣāṇ Rājavaṃśa"), BHS: "", Parthian: "Kušanxšaθr") was first formed in the early 1st century AD. It was in eastern and northern Afghanistan and the north-west of India.

The Kushan were a branch of the Yuezhi confederation. Previously a nomadic people living in eastern Central Asia, the Yuezhi moved southwest and settled in ancient Bactria.
