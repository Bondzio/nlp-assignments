As part of the NHL's 75th anniversary celebration, throwback uniforms were worn by Original Six teams for select games, and throwbacks were also worn for the All-Star Game.

The uniform styles that were worn include:
Boston Bruins - circa 1933
Chicago Blackhawks - circa 1940
Detroit Red Wings - circa 1928
Montreal Canadiens - circa 1926
New York Rangers - circa 1940
Toronto Maple Leafs - circa 1940
Wales All-Stars - white All-Star jersey circa 1952
Campbell All-Stars - red All-Star jersey circa 1952

The throwback uniforms would have an impact on future seasons in the NHL, as several teams adopted throwbacks as alternate jerseys. The National Football League and National Basketball Association would follow the NHL's lead, with teams wearing throwbacks to celebrate their leagues' 75th and 50th anniversaries, respectively.
