Owen Hart

Owen James Hart (May 7, 1965 â€“ May 23, 1999) was a Canadian professional wrestler. He competed for many professional wrestling promotions including Stampede Wrestling, New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) where he was most well known. While in the WWF, Hart competed under his real name and the ring name The Blue Blazer. He was a member of the Hart wrestling family and was the youngest of 12 children of Stampede Wrestling promoter and WWE Hall of Famer Stu Hart and Helen Hart.

He was a one time WWF European Champion, two time WWF Intercontinental champion, four time WWF Tag Team champion and was the 1994 King of the Ring. 

Hart died on the night of May 23 1999, while performing a stunt which involved him being lowered down to the ring from the rafters, the cape he was wearing with his "Blue Blazer" gimmick got stuck in the release hatch of the cord he was trying to yank it out but when he did the release hatch released and he fell 78 feet down into the ring landing on the top rope (this happened during the 1999 Over the Edge.)

The next WWF Raw was a two hour special tribute show to Hart called "Raw is Owen", It featured remembrance matches and shoot interviews with fellow wrestlers. They tolled the bell ten times (known as a "ten bell salute") in memory of Hart.
