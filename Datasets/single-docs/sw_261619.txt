Alvarezsaurus

Alvarezsaurus is a small dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina, about 86-83 million years ago. It measured about 2 meters in length and weighed 20 kilograms. 

It was named by paleontologist Jose Bonaparte in 1991. It walked on two legs, had a long tail, and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner. It may have eaten insects. It was more primitive than other, better-known members of its family, such as "Mononykus" and "Shuvuuia". 

"Alvarezsaurus" was featured in the Discovery Channel television series "Dinosaur Planet", which speculated that it was a predator of young "Saltasaurus", although these species did not exist at the same time, "Alvarezsaurus" being about 5 million years older than "Saltasaurus".
