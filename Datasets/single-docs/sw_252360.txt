Dino Bravo

Adolfo Bresciano (August 6, 1948 â€“ March 10, 1993) was an Italian-born Canadian professional wrestler. He was better known by his ring name Dino Bravo. He was self-proclaimed as "Canada's Strongest Man" and later the "World's Strongest Man". Bravo is best known for his time wrestling in World Wrestling Federation (WWF). During his time there, Bravo was a one-time WWWF World Tag Team Champion with Dominic DeNucci and was the only wrestler to ever hold the short-lived WWF Canadian Champion.

On March 10, 1993, Bravo was found dead in his apartment by his wife. Bravo was hit by 17 bullets, 7 to the head and 10 to the torso, while he was watching ice hockey in his Vimont, Laval, Quebec home. He had an alleged role in illegal cigarette smuggling in Canada which is what is popularly believed to have led to his unsolved murder.
