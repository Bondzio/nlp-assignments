Emperor Junnin

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was Ōi"-shinnō" (Ōi-no-ō). The posthumous name of Emperor Junnin was given by Emperor Meiji.

He was the seventh son of Prince Toneri, a son of Emperor Temmu. His father died when he was at the age of three, and he was given no rank nor office of the court.

His fate was changed in 757 when Empress Kōken named him as her heir (crown prince).




Junnin caused grain storage centers ("Jōheisō") to be established in the provinces. The government stored rice from the years of good harvests. This rice was used to control higher prices when harvests of rice were not good. The "Jōheisō" were abolished during the Kamakura period.

The actual site of Junnin's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Awaji. 

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Junnin's mausoleum. It is formally named "Awaji no misasagi".

In 1870, Emperor Meiji conferred the posthumous name and title by which he is now known.

The years of Junnin's reign are identified by a single era name.
