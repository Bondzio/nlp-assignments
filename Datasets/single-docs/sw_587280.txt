Generative adversarial networks

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are neural network artificial intelligences that work together to give better answers. One neural net is the tricky net, and the other one is the useful net. The tricky net will try to give an input to the useful net that will cause the useful net to give a bad answer. The useful net will then learn not to give a bad answer, and the tricky net will try to trick the useful net again. As this continues, the useful net will get better and not become tricked as often, and the useful net will be able to be used to make good predictions.
