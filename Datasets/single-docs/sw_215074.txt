Assassination of Julius Caesar

The assassination of Julius Caesar was the result of a conspiracy by forty Roman senators, the self-styled "Liberatores". They were led by Cassius and Brutus.

The conspirators stabbed Caesar to death in the "Theatre of Pompey" on the Ides of March, 15 March 44 BC. Caesar was the dictator of the Roman Republic at the time. He had been declared "dictator perpetuo" (dictator for life) by the Senate. This declaration resulted in many senators fearing that Caesar wanted to overthrow the Senate in favour of a tyranny. 

The assassination led to civil war. The Second Triumvirate led to the ascendancy of Caesar's adopted heir Octavian to the position of emperor, and the dissolution of the Republic leading to the Roman Empire. So it turned out that, by murdering Caesar, the Liberators had brought about the end of the Republic they hated so much.
