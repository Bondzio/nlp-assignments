Kitzingen Rural District

Kitzingen is a district in Bavaria, Germany.

The district was last changed in 1973. The old district of Gerolzhofen was split up, and half of its territory was joined with the old Kitzingen district. The city of Kitzingen lost its status as an independent city and was put into the district.

The Main River runs through the district from south to north.
