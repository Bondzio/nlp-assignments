Kate Beckinsale

Kathrin Romary Beckinsale (born July 26, 1973) is an English actress. She starred in the movies such as "Pearl Harbor" (2001), "Underworld" (2003) and "Van Helsing" (2004).

Kathrin Romary Beckinsale was born in Chiswick, London, England. She is the only child of actor Richard Beckinsale and actress Judy Loe. Her father was of one-quarter Burmese ancestry. She made her first television appearance at the age of four, in an episode of "This is Your Life" dedicated to her father. When she was five years old, her 31-year-old father died suddenly of a heart attack. Beckinsale was deeply traumatised by the loss and "started expecting bad things to happen". While she has seen her father "more on television than I have in life", "there are certainly enough memories for me not to feel that it's somebody I didn't know." Her widowed mother moved in with director Roy Battersby when Beckinsale was nine and she was brought up alongside his four sons and daughter. She has a close relationship with her stepfather: "I couldn't have knitted a better one ... He wasn't pushy, he let me come to him." She has a paternal half-sister, actress Samantha Beckinsale.
