Infante Philip, Duke of Calabria

Prince Philip of Naples and Sicily, Duke of Calabria, Infante of Spain (13 June 1747 â€“ 19 September 1777). At his birth he was the eldest son of King Carlo of Naples and Sicily and was the heir to the throne but never succeeded. His younger brothers, Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies replaced him in the succession. When his father became King of Spain in 1759, Philip remained in Naples where he lived until his death from smallpox at the age of thirty. He was given the title of Duke of Calabria as heir to the throne.

Named after his grandfather Philip V of Spain, he was expected to succeed to the Spanish throne at his fathers death. By birth he was an "infante" of Spain as well as a prince of the kingdoms of Sicily and Naples. He was the heir to one of the largest collection of former Italian states. Because of his disability he was mostly kept out of public view and forced to live quietly at the Palace's of Capodimonte and the Palace of Caserta. He died of smallpox in 1777, unmarried and childless.
