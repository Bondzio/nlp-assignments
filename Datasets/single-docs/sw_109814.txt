Regis Philbin

Regis Francis Xavier Philbin (; born August 25, 1931) is an American media personality, actor and singer, known for hosting talk and game shows since the 1960s. Sometimes called (alternatively attributed to James Brown) "the hardest working man in show business". He is often called "the hardest working man in show business" and holds the world record for the most time spent in front of a television camera. He is most widely known for "Live! with Regis and Kelly" (previously "Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee"), "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", "Million Dollar Password", and for hosting the first season of "America's Got Talent".

Philbin was born in the Bronx, New York City. His father, Francis "Frank" Philbin, a U.S. Marine who served in the Pacific, was of Irish ancestry. His mother, Filomena "Florence" (nee Boscia), was of Arbëreshë ancestry. They lived in the Van Nest section of the Bronx. Philbin was raised Roman Catholic. He was supposedly named "Regis" because his father wanted him to attend the prestigious Regis High School. It was long believed that Philbin was an only child, but on the February 1, 2007, broadcast of "Live with Regis and Kelly", Philbin announced that he did have a brother, Frank M. Philbin (March 1, 1951 – January 27, 2007), who had died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma several days earlier. Philbin said his brother had asked to not be mentioned on television or in the press.

Philbin attended Our Lady of Solace grammar school in the Bronx, and graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1949 before attending the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated in 1953 with a sociology degree. He later served in the United States Navy as a supply officer, then went through a few behind-the-scenes jobs in television and radio before moving into the broadcasting arena.

On November 18, 2011, Philbin aired his final episode on "Live with Regis and Kelly."
