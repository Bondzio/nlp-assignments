Southern Europe

Southern Europe is a region of the European continent. Most people see Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece and over all the Mediterranean countries of the European continent as parts of Southern Europe. Very often the South of France is also included. 

Geographically, Southern Europe would be the south half of the landmass of Europe. This definition is relative, with no clear limits.
The Alps mountains are a physical barrier between Italy and the rest of Europe.

For its official works and publications, the United Nations Organization has its own special definition of regions. Corsica for example is part of France, thus not part of Southern Europe, but Italian Tyrol belongs to Southern Europe as it is part of Italy..

The climatic definition of southern Europe would be similar to the areas of Mediterranean climate. The Mediterranean climate is often thought to be a typical characteristic of Southern Europe. 

Countries of Latin Europe are often associated with the concept of Southern Europe, especially Italy and Spain. 
Greece, Malta and Anatolia are often associated with them.
