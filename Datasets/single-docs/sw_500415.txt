Urban heat island

An urban heat island, or UHI, is what happens when a city is warmer than the area around it. It happens because things in cities like concrete take longer to give off heat than things like trees, which are common outside of cities. The urban heat island effect is stronger at night and when there is not much wind. Cities can be 3Â°C warmer than nearby countryside.
