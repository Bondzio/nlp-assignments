Platonic love

Platonic love or platonic relationship means a close relationship between two people that is not sexual. In the modern use it has generally been used to mean a non-sexual relationship between heterosexual friends. The term is named after the philosopher Plato. He was the first to describe this kind of love. Plato calls this his theory of "er√¥s" (meaning "love"). He describes this philosophy in his dialogues "the Phaedrus" and "the Symposium". Like many in his society, Plato was most interested in the same-sex relationships between older and younger men. But his theory can apply to other kinds of erotic relationships as well. Platonic love includes a sexual desire that is overcome by a stronger desire and appreciation for friendship.
