Operation Cornflakes

The Operation Cornflakes occurred in February â€“ March 1945 during World War II. It was a military propaganda provocation operation of the American intelligence in the enemy territory. Fake stamps similar to real issues of German postage stamps were produced and spread in the hostile territory. In philatelic terms, they are illegal and have status of forgeries, falsification (fakes) or cinderellas. The specific case of passage by mail was an interesting operation of Intelligence; otherwise, stamps in the circulation would be identified and destroyed by post employees and/or intelligence agencies of victim state.
