2014 ATP World Tour

The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour is the top level professional tennis tour for men's tennis competitions. The 2014 ATP Tour calendar is made up of four Grand Slam tournaments (organised by the International Tennis Federation (ITF)), and sixty-one regular tournaments. It also includes the Davis Cup (organised by the ITF), and the year-end championships (the ATP World Tour Finals). The Hopman Cup, which does not distribute ranking points, is included. The season begins on 30 December 2013 and will end on 17 November 2014.

The tournaments are played on flat surface, called a tennis court. The measurements of a tennis court are set by the ITF. The court is long and wide. Its width is for singles matches and for doubles matches. Tennis is played on a variety of tennis court types. Each type has to be played differently. There are four main types of courts based on what's used to build the court surface, clay, hard, grass and carpet courts. The ITF ranks them by five different speed ratings from slow to fast.
