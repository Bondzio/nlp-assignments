Pixies

The Pixies are an American alternative rock band. The band started in 1986. They broke up in 1993, but they started to play together again from 2004 to the present. There are four members in the band: Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass guitar, vocals), and David Lovering (drums).

The Pixies' band members came together during the mid-1980s. Joey Santiago and Frank Black met at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where they were students. Santiago introduced Black to new music, such as David Bowie.

In 1985, they decided to create a band. Kim Deal joined on bass guitar after answering an advertisement in a Boston newspaper. The band's musical style was influenced by bands such as Hüsker Dü. David Lovering, the drummer and a friend of Deal, joined in late 1985.

The band released their first album, "Come on Pilgrim", in 1987. The released one album every year from 1987-1991. Although they were not very successful in the USA, they were popular for alternative rock fans in Europe. In 1988, they recorded a session with British radio DJ John Peel because he felt they were a good band.

The band had many problems, with band members disagreeing on certain issues. In 1989, the band nearly asked Kim Deal to leave because of her laziness. She was also trying to take more control as a songwriter. These problems got worse and in 1993, they split up.

The Pixies influenced many bands that were more successful, such as Nirvana and OK Go.

They re-united and went on a tour in 2004-2005. However, they have yet to release a new album.

The lyrics to the Pixies' songs are well known for being unusual. The band are also well known for combining loud music with more quiet melodies, and for combining pop with rock.
