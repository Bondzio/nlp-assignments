Dawson College shooting

The Dawson College shooting was a school shooting incident on September 13, 2006, which took place at the Dawson College in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Kimveer Gill, a twenty-five year old Indo-Canadian, shot 20 people and killed 1 person as well as himself (suicide) after being shot in the arm by a police officer.

Gill had a Vampirefreaks.com profile and mentioned the song "À Tout le Monde" by thrash metal band Megadeth on the day of the shooting. News outlets blamed Megadeth for the shooting. Later in 2006, Megadeth performed a live concert in Montreal and responded to the blame they and their music received. Lead singer and guitarist Dave Mustaine said to the crowd:

Mustaine was also interviewed by CBC News before Megadeth's concert and said :

Gill drove to the college campus and parked his car. Bystanders saw that Gill took weapons out of his trunk. He took a person as a hostage and forced him to carry a bag which had a fourth gun and more ammunition in it. Gill shot at students that were outside on the steps of the college near the rear entrance. The hostage ran away with Gill's bag and hid it. 

Gill entered the school and went to cafeteria. He walked to the corner of the room and shot students that were standing in front of him. He ordered the students to lie on the floor and shot at more students. Two police officers that were visiting the school at the time because of an unrelated incident rushed to the cafeteria after hearing the gunfire. More officers surrounded the college and Gill took two more people hostage. Officer Denis Côté shot him in the arm and Gill killed himself. The officers tried to bring him back to life but they failed.
