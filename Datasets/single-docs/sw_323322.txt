Sacramento River

The Sacramento River is a river in California in the United States. It flows through the Sacramento Valley in northern California, and is about long. The Sacramento has many tributaries, including the Pit, Feather and American Rivers. Cities along the river include Redding and Sacramento.

Native people have inhabited the region for about 12,000 years. The Sacramento River's tributaries were the focus of the California Gold Rush, which brought many settlers to the area in the 1800s. Today, the river is used as a source of irrigation water and to produce hydroelectricity.
