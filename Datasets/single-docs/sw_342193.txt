Argentine Declaration of Independence

What today is commonly called the Independence of Argentina was made on July 9, 1816. It was done by the Congress of Tucumán. In reality, the congressmen that were together in Tucumán declared the independence of the United Provinces of South America. This is still today one of the legal names of the Argentine Republic. The Federal League Provinces, were at war with the United Provinces. They were not allowed into the Congress. Many provinces from Upper Peru were at the Congress.

Independence began with the 1810 May Revolution.
