Smile (album)

Smile was an album by The Beach Boys. Their bass player Brian Wilson wanted the album to be the follow-up to the album "Pet Sounds". For some reasons, it was not released for over 30 years.

After seeing the success that "Pet Sounds" had been, Wilson wanted to make an album that was even better. In late 1966, he started work on what he said would be "the greatest rock album ever made." He asked Van Dyke Parks to write words for new songs. 

"Smile" was not completed on time for at least three reasons:

When the time came to release the album, Brian said that the album was not finished and would be delayed for an unknown length of time. People still hoped that he would finish it, but in May 1967, the album was cancelled. Wilson had stopped working on it and said it would never be finished.

Later in 1967, The Beach Boys released another album called "Smiley Smile". The album had songs that were written for "Smile". "Smiley Smile" was not the great success that Wilson thought "Smile" would have been. The Beach Boys lost many fans because of the album's failure. The failure also cost Capitol Records much money because not enough people bought the album.

As Carl lamented, they tried for a homerun with "Smile", and ended up hitting a bunt with "Smiley Smile".

In 2004, Brian finished "Smile". The album was a success. People were happy that "Smile" could finally be heard as it was meant to be heard.
