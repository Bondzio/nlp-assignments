Hiroshima Prefecture

The area of Bingo Province and Aki Province were merged in Hiroshima Prefecture. 

Hiroshima is a traditional center of the Chūgoku region and was the seat of the Mōri clan until the Battle of Sekigahara.

Hiroshima is home to two UNESCO World Heritage sites:

Hiroshima faces Shikoku across the Seto Inland Sea. Hiroshima Bay opens on the Inland Sea. The prefecture also includes many small islands.

Yamaguchi Prefecture is to the south and west of the prefecture Shimane Prefecture is to the northwest. East of Hiroshima is Okayama Prefecture.

National Parks are established in about 4% of the total land area of the prefecture.

"Itsukushima jinja" is the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") in the prefecture.
