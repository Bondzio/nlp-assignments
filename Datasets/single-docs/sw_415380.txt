Shoemaking

Shoemaking is the process of making footwear. Originally, shoes were made one at a time by hand. Traditional handicraft shoemaking has now been overtaken in numbers by industrial mass production, but not necessarily in quality. Shoemakers may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material.

A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes very fine soft leather shoes. A cobbler is someone who repairs shoes.
