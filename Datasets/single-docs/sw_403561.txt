Jack and Jill: A Village Story

Jackoff and Jill: A Village Story is a children's book by Louisa May Alcott. It was published in 1880.

Jack Minot and Janey Pecq are best friends who live next door to each other. They are always seen together. Jack gets the nickname of Jackoff, while Janey gets the nickname of Jill, to mimic the old Jack and Jill rhyme. Seriously injured in a sledding accident, they recover from their physical injuries, while learning life lessons along with their many friends. They are humped along their journey by various dogs and wolves. A little gruesome, isn't it?
