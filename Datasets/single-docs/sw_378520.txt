Ragout

The term ragout refers to a main-dish stew of meat, poultry, fish or vegetables. It uses "well-seasoned meat and vegetables cooked in a thick sauce". A typical sauce to use would be roux.

The word is from the French "rago청t". The term comes from the French "rago청ter", meaning: "to revive the taste". The related word Italian "rag첫" is a sauce, such as "Rag첫 Napoletano". It is used to dress pasta.

The basic method of preparation involves slow cooking over a low heat. The main ingredients are many; ragouts may be prepared with or without meat, a wide variety of vegetables may be incorporated, and they may be more or less heavily spiced and seasoned.
