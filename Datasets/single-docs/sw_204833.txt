Brain cell

Brain cells are a group of cells that includes neurons and glial cells. The neurons perform the tasks, and the glial cells look after the neurons. Current research suggests that glia have a more complex function than just supporting neurons, some new functions have been identified. A child over 3 years old has over 1,000 trillion synapses.
