Mastic ice cream

Mastic ice cream is common in Greece, Arab countries and Turkey. It is named after the Mastic (plant resin) spice being traditionally produced on Greek island of Chios, and, like other natural resins, in its natural form it is "tears" or drops. Because the real mastic is expensive and difficult to find, ice cream sellers of the other countries prefer to replace the mastic spice with glucose.
