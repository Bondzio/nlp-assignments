Cuando Cubango Province

Cuando Cubango is a province of Angola. There are about 140,000 people. Menongue is the capital of the province. 

The name of the province is from the Cuando and Cubango rivers. They both flow through the province.

This area had the endangered Painted Hunting Dog. The land was destroyed during the Cuban intervention years. The Painted Hunting Dog is no longer there.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Cuando Cubango was the main base camp of Angola's UNITA rebel movement.
