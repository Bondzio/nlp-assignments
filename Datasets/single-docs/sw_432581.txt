Euromaidan

Euromaidan () is a period of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine. It began on the night of 21 November 2013 with protests demanding that Ukraine become part of the European Union. On 30 November 2013 riot police attacked protestors, violently putting a stop to the protests. The protesters then demanded the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. Many people have been killed in the riots.

The President fled in February 2014 but protests continued. On March 2014 the Russian Federation captured Crimea which angered many other nations. As a result, many fear this may lead to a global war.

Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the western part of the country, wanted to be part of Europe. But the President wanted to keep relationships with Russia. This made people mad and they started protesting. Then on 30 November, the cops attacked them. As a result, more people came out to protest.

Many people blocked the streets with their cars in a protest called "Automaidan". 
As the riots continued, the protesters were attacked. Hundreds were killed or injured. Ukrainians got the freedom they wanted and a new government. But they lost Crimea to Russia.

Russia did not like the Ukrainian government being overthrown. Some of the people in the east who preferred the old President declared independence and wanted to join Russia. Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the east, suffered in fighting.
