Heckler &amp; Koch G36

The Heckler & Koch G36 is an assault rifle designed in the 1990s by Heckler & Koch (H&K) in Germany. The weapon is gas operated and has a standard magazine that holds 30 of the 5.56mm NATO rounds. It can also be used with a 100-round 'drum'. The G36 has a 3x scope and often a red dot sight, too in the carrying handle. The G36 is the main weapon of many special units and the army of Portugal, Spain and Germany (Bundeswehr). 

Before Heckler & Koch started building for Germany, the G36 has had the name "HK50".
