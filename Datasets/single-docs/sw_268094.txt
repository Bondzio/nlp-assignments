Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas

"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is an extremely popular Christmas song that is played every holiday season. The words were written by Ralph Blane and the music by Hugh Martin in 1943. The song was first introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 movie, "Meet Me In St. Louis". A modified version was introduced by Frank Sinatra who felt the original was too sad for his 1957 album, "A Jolly Christmas". It has also been recorded by many other performers including Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato and the Pretenders. In 2007 ASCAP listed the song at number three in the 25 most played holiday songs.
