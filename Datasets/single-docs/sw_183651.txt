Photographic filter

A photographic filter is a lens that is used in photography to filter the light. There are different kinds of filters:

Filters can be cheap or expensive. Glass (or plastic) that is treated or coated in different ways usually costs more. Some filters can be screwed in front of a lens that is made for this. Others can be placed in the back of the lens, or in special filter holders screwed in at the front.
