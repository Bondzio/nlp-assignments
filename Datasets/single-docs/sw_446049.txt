The Hardy Boyz

The Hardy Boyz is a professional wrestling tag team. The team members were real-life brothers Matt and Jeff Hardy. The Hardy Boyz are best known for competing in World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWE). They were known for competing in ladder matches and Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches. They also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) for a short time. The team first started in independent promotions around North Carolina in 1993.

The team signed with the WWF in 1998. They joined Gangrel to form The New Brood in August 1999. During their time in the WWF, they were managed by Terri for a short time before they were managed full-time by their real-life friend Lita. When Lita joined, the team was known as "Team Xtreme". They split up in 2002 and reunited in 2006 to feud with MNM before they decided to focus on singles competition. Jeff left the company in August and Matt left in late 2010.

They both reunited in January 2011 in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where they were members of the Immortal stable. Matt was released from the company in August 2011 after he was arrested for driving while intoxicated.
