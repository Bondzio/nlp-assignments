Pak Beng dam

The Pak Beng dam is a project (as of 2017) to build a hydroelectric power plant and a dam on the Mekong river - inside Laos.

Laos "has already begun preparatory work for the 912-megawatt Pak Beng dam in the northern province of Oudomxay, and the official Lao News Agency reported ... that construction would begin in early 2017", according to an article in Seattle Times in 2016.

"The project is set to be financed by the Chinese firm, Datang Overseas Investment".

"Citizens from eight Thai provinces along the Mekong River are suing [as of June 2017,] state agencies [in Thailand] because they claim there was inadequate public participation in planning for the Pak Beng hydropower dam, which is being built by Laos".
