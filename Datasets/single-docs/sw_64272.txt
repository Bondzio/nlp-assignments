Mathematical notation

Mathematical notation is a field of mathematics. In mathematics and other exact sciences like physics or computer science, problems often need to be presented in some way. In such representations, different symbols have different meanings:

Some mathematical notations use diagrams, or small drawings to show the underlying concepts. One example is the Penrose graphical notation which is used to show tensors. Another examples are Coxeterâ€“Dynkin diagram which are used for certain problems of geometry. 

There are different ways to write down an "equation" like " two and three"
