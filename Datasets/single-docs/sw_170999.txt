Whopper

Whopper is a kind of hamburger sold at the fast-food chain Burger King. It is made using a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, sliced onion, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. Also, cheese can be added at the customer's request. There is also a Double Whopper available.

A "Whopper Jr." is the same as the Whopper, but in a smaller size.
