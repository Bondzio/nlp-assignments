Islam in Nigeria

About 85,000,000 Nigerians are Muslims. That is about half of the people of Nigeria. Most of the rest of the people are Christian. Muslims in Nigeria are predominantly Sunni in the Maliki school, which is also the governing Sharia law. However, there is a significant Shia minority, mostly in Sokoto State (see Shia in Nigeria). A smaller number of people follow the Ahmadiyya Islam, a reformatory sect that started in 19th century India. Pew Forum on religious diversity says that 12% are Shia Muslims while 3% are Ahmadi Muslims.
