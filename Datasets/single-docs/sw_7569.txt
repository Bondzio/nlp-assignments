Snoopy

Snoopy is the name of Charlie Brown's pet beagle in the comic strip "Peanuts", by Charles M. Schulz. Born on the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Snoopy started out in the background, but eventually turned into a main character. Snoopy was noted for his many alter egos, including The World War I Flying Ace, The Scout Leader and World Literary Ace.

Snoopy's house is so much larger inside than it appears from the outside. The house has stairs and the lower floor has TV, air conditioner, table tennis set, billiard set, library, and so on. Charlie Brown made it.



Snoopy is in the game Clash of Clans and Clash Royale as the Lava Hound.
