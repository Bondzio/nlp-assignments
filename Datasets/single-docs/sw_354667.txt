Vase in the Form of a Phallus

Vase in the Form of a Phallus is an ancient Greek terracotta vase in the form of a flaccid uncircumcized penis. The scrotum and public hair are depicted. Its overall measurements are 4 1/2 x 4 x 3 1/2in. (11.4 x 10.2 x 8.9Â cm). It dates to the Archaic period, about 550500 BC. Phallic vases are rare in Archaic Greek pottery and this vase probably held a perfumed oil for erotic or medicinal uses. It was probably made in Rhodes. The museum writes that the vase displays a playfulness typical of Greek art.
