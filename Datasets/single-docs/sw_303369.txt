SN 1987A

SN 1987A was a supernova that was in a small galaxy that is orbiting our Milky Way galaxy. The supernova was 168,000 light years away, which means it happened 168,00 years ago in 1987 when it was discovered. It was close enough that scientists found neutrinos before the light came to Earth. SN 1987A is the only supernova that has been that close in modern times and was the brightest object seen from Earth in over 400 years.There have been many others that were closer but they were before scientists had the tools to help them understand what was happening.
