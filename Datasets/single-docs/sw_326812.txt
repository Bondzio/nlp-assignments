Former Provinces of Hokkaidō

The Former Provinces of Hokkaido were created by the Meiji period government of Japan in 1869. They lasted only until the creation of prefectures.

In 1869, the island of Hokkaidō was organized into 11 provinces. 

Other than the Hokkaido provinces, the majority of Japan's former provinces were converted into prefectures by the Meiji government between 1870 and 1876.

The Hokkaidō provinces were dissolved in 1882. In that year, they were replaced with Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture. 

In 1886, Hakodate, Sapporo and Nemuro prefectures were abolished. The reform replaced with another entity called the . 

In 1947, Hokkaido Prefecture was established. The old provincial boundaries are mirrored in the island's subprefectures.

Although the 19th century provinces of Hokkaidō lasted for only a short time, the subdivisions of the land of the island are very much like those which still exist.
