Lymphoma

Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. There are many types of lymphoma, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, the B-cell lymphoma, and the hepatosplenic lymphoma. 


Chemotherapy is often used for both Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiotherapy may also be used.
