The New World Order (professional wrestling)

The New World Order (also known as just nWo) is a professional wrestling stable that is best known for competing in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E). The stable was created on July 7, 1996 and broke up on July 15, 2002. nWo had a gimmick of a group of unsanctioned wrestlers trying to "take over" WCW.

The nWo angle was based on Universal Wrestling Federation's invasion of New Japan Pro Wrestling. A well known moment happened at "Bash at the Beach" when Hulk Hogan unexpectedly turned heel for the first time in nearly fifteen years. The nWo angle is one of the most popular and successful angles in modern-day professional wrestling.
