Common buzzard

The common buzzard ("Buteo buteo") is a bird of prey, very widespread in the Old World. It lives in most of Europe and into Asia. It is between 51 and 57 cm in length. The wings are between 110–150 cm (48–60 inch) when spread out. They can have a lot of different colours, from almost pure white to black. Usually, they are brown.

It breeds in woodlands. It hunts over open land. It eats mainly small mammals like pheasant, rabbit and also lizards. It can be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects. 

Buzzards do not normally form flocks, but several may be seen together on migration or in a good habitat. Pairs mate for life.
