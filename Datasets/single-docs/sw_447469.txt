David Bateson

David Bateson (born 9 February 1960) is a South African-British actor. He was born in South Africa. He is known best for providing the voice and appearance of Agent 47, the main character of IO Interactive's computer and video game series "Hitman".

Bateson was born in South Africa to English parents. He became an actor before returning to Britain in 1984. He later moved to Canada, and later to Copenhagen, Denmark. He is a full member of British Equity and Danish Actors Union.

His first achievement was in 1994 film "Prince of Jutland". He also played the part of a young sailor in the 1996 film "Breaking the Waves". He played the main role in the 2002 film "Debutanten".

In the "Hitman game series", Bateson provided the voice, physical guide and appearance of Agent 47. He stayed as the character model until the fifth game, "", when he said to a member of a "Hitman" fan forum that "No one from IO Interactive is answering my calls, e-mails or sms."

However on 28 August 2012, the "Hitman" Facebook page confirmed that Bateson will once again be voicing 47. Brand Director Jon Brooke said his absence made them realise they wanted him.
