Madden NFL 09

Madden NFL 09 is a video game about the National Football League (NFL). It was published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon.

"Madden NFL 09 All-Play" for the Wii has several exclusive features.

New York Jets quarterback Brett Favre is on the cover.

On the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS versions, play-by-play and color commentary is provided by Tom Hammond and Cris Collinsworth, respectively, replacing Al Michaels and John Madden. However, Michaels and Madden still appear on the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP versions. Madden still has a part in Madden 09 as the person describing instructions to the Madden IQ. Madden guides you on advice and other things to help you understand how to raise your Madden IQ. Madden also appears in Mii form in the Wii version of the game, suggesting plays to run in the game's "Madden's Pick" feature.

EA's relationship with ESPN also enables tie-ins with different ESPN shows.
