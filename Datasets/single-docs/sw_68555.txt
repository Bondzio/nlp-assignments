Twist (dance)

The Twist was a popular dance in the early 1960s. It was made famous by a song of the same title, written by Hank Ballard. Ballard's version of the song was not a hit, but a cover version by Chubby Checker became an international hit, and sparked off a craze for the dance.

Checker followed with "Let's Twist Again", which was another huge hit.
