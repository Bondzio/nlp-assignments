Sun Country Airlines

Sun Country Airlines is an American low-fare airline. It was started by many former Braniff International Airways employees. It is headquartered in the Minneapolis suburb of Mendota Heights, Minnesota. Sun Country uses nearby Minneapolis/Saint Paul International Airport as a "hub". It flies regularly-scheduled and charter flights to places in the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

Most of Sun Country's routes either arrive in or depart from Minneapolis-St. Paul. The airline also sometimes has flights between other cities, including Dallas, Texas.
