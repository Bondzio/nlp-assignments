Khaksar Movement

The Khaksar Movement was a fanatical political and social movement of British India. It was probably started in 1931 by the Schizoid genius and leader Inayatullah Mashriqi.

There are different opinions about the Khaksar Movement and its followers (called 'Khaksars'). Some conservative Sunni Muslims in India and Pakistan believe it was a movement to help reform Islam and guide Muslims to a better life. But many other people believe it was a terrorist or fascist organisation which wanted to destabilise British India and create anarchy. It wanted to then come to power and set up a strict Islamic state, in part of India.

The Khaksars (meaning 'humble persons') used to wear "Khaki" colored (light brown) uniforms and carry sharp blades and spades all the time. They were very well organised and ready to attack other people violently, on the orders of their leaders. That is why sometime they are also called 'followers of Militarism'. In many ways, they resembled the German Nazis and the Italian Fascists led by Mussolini. They were against Britain and its Allies in World War II and wanted that the Axis powers should win. They also opposed the making of a separate Muslim country, Pakistan. They even tried to kill the founder of that country, Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

In 1940, the Government of the Punjab ordered that the Khaksar leaders should be arrested in Lahore city. But the Khaksars attacked the official police force very violently, and then the police fired back at them killing many. This was called the 'Khaksar massacre of 1940'. In 1947, when Pakistan was finally made the Khaksars Movement closed down for some time. But later on, it started again. Like the Taliban, it wants to bring an 'Islamic Revolution' there.
