Bernardo O'Higgins

Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme (1778–1842) was a Chilean independence leader. Along with José de San Martín, he is credited with liberating Chile from Spanish rule. Although he was the second (1817–1823), he is considered one of Chile's founding fathers. He was also the first leader of a fully independent Chilean state.
