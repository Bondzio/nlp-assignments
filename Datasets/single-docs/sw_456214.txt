The "arrondissement" is bordered to the north by the "arrondissement" of Albi, to the northeast by the Aveyron (Occitanie) department, to the east by the Hérault (Occitanie) department, to the south by the Aude (Occitanie) department and to the west by the Haute-Garonne (Occitanie) department.

After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the "arrondissements" so they could have "communes" that belong to different "arrondissements". That is the case of the Le Haut Dadou and the Les Portes du Tarn cantons where some "communes" are in the "arrondissement" of Castres and others in the "arrondissement" of Albi. The following table shows the distribution of the "communes" in the cantons and "arrondissements":
