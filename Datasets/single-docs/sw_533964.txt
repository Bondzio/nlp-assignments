Tasmanian oak

Tasmanian oak (or Australian oak) is hardwood timber made from some types of "Eucalyptus" trees in Tasmania. The trees for making Tasmanian oak are "Eucalyptus regnans", "Eucalyptus obliqua" or "Eucalyptus delegatensis". It is a light-coloured type of wood. It is used for building, furniture and paper.

Wood from the same species of trees in Victoria is called Victorian ash.
