Barbary Coast

The Barbary Coast, or Berber Coast, was the land of the Berber people. It was the name used by Europeans from the 16th to the 19th century. It was the coast of North Africa â€“ what is now Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. 

This area was used by pirates. They attacked ships and coastal towns. They stole goods and people to sell as slaves from Europe, America and sub-Saharan Africa.
