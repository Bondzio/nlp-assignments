Beowulf (hero)

Beowulf is the hero of the Anglo-Saxon poem "Beowulf". He was the son of Ecgþeow, a banished warrior of the Wægmundings. Ecgþeow had killed a man from another clan and had to flee to the Danes. The Danish king Hroðgar accepted him as one of his warriors.

When king Hroðgar came into difficulties because his land was raided by the giant Grendel, Ecgþeow's son Beowulf came to help him with twelve warriors. During the night, Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men. Beowulf attacked him without his sword and tore the arm off the beast. Grendel flew and his arm was fixed to the wall. During the following night Grendel's Mother arrived and Beowulf had an even harder fight against her, but he won.

Later on in life, Beowulf ruled over his native Geatland for 50 years until a dragon attacked after a golden goblet was stolen from its cave. He travels to its cave and successfully slays it, but is severely injured in the melee. The dying Beowulf then crowns a young warrior called Wiglaf as his successor (as he himself does not have children and all his predecessors have died). He is then burned on a pyre.
There have been many ficton books and films made based on "Beowulf". Beowulf appeared in most of them.
