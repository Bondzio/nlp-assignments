Tanuma Okitsugu

Tanuma was also a daimyo of the Sagara han. He used the title Tonomo-no-kami.

The administration of Tanuma was marked by corruption and by inflation of currency. 

In 1784 ("Tenmei" 4), Okitsugu's son was assassinated in front of his father inside Edo Castle. The involvement of senior figures in the "bakufu" was suspected, but only the assassin was punished. The result was that liberal reforms and the relaxation of the national isolation policy "sakoku" were stopped.
