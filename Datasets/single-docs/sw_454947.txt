Gliese 876

Gliese 876 is a red dwarf about 15 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. It is the closest star known to be a multiplanetary system. As of 2011, four extrasolar planets have been found orbiting the star.

It is the third closest known star to the Sun which has a planetary system, after Epsilon Eridani (10.5 ly) and Gliese 674 (14.8 ly). 

Two of the middle planets are in the system's habitable zone. However, they are giant planets thought to be like Jupiter.
