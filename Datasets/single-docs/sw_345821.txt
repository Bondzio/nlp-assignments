Jamesâ€“Lange theory

The James-Lange Theory is a hypothesis about emotions. It is one of the earliest theories of emotion. The theory is that emotions come from the physiological response to what is happening around us.

It was developed independently by two 19th-century scholars, William James and Carl Lange. The basic idea of the theory is that physiological arousal triggers the experience of a specific emotion. The theory is that the physiological change is primary, and emotion is caused by the information from the body's nervous system.

The theory has been criticised and modified over the course of time. There are several competing theories.
