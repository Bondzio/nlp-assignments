Halibut

Halibut is a kind of flatfish often used for food and living in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans (they live in warm water). The halibut from the Atlantic ocean has been overfished. It might become extinct. 

Their names come from "haly" (holy) and "butt" (flat fish), because it is said people like to eat them on Catholic holy-days.
