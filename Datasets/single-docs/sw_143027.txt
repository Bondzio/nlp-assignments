Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964) is a children's book by British author Roald Dahl. This story of the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric candymaker Willy Wonka is often considered one of the most beloved children's stories of the 20th century. It has been made into a movie twice.

Only five children were to be allowed into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Only those five would see all the mysterious machinery in the factory where the world's most wonderful sweets are made. Those five children are greedy Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, smart-alecky Mike Teavee and our hero Charlie Bucket. What happens when the children pass through the big factory doors and, one by one, disobey Mr Willy Wonka's orders? 
"No, no, no, no, no! You mustn't do it." said Mr Willy Wonka. But they do...and what happens?
