Omega (letter)

Omega (uppercase/lowercase Ω ω), is the 24th and last letter of the Greek alphabet. It stood for a long "o" sound in Ancient Greek. It still stands for "o" in Modern Greek, but there is no longer a difference between long and short vowels, so it sounds the same as Omicron. In the system of Greek numerals, it stands for the number 800. 

There was also once a letter "Omega" Ѡ in the Cyrillic alphabet. It was there so people could spell Greek names both in Cyrillic and in Greek in the same way. But this letter is no longer used today.

In electromagnetism and engineering, uppercase omega (Ω) is utilized as the symbol for ohms, which are the units of electrical resistance. In physics and other sciences, lowercase omega (ω) is often used to represent .
