List of heavy mortars

Heavy mortars are large-calibre mortars which fire a heavy shell on a high angle trajectory. These weapons have a short range, but are usually less complex than similar sized field artillery.

This category includes the "Trench Mortars" of World War I. These were all heavy and difficult to move.
