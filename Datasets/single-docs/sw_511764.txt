Mi querida España

"Mi querida España" ("My Dearest Spain" or "My Lovely Spain") is a song. It was written and sung by the Spanish songwriter Cecilia in 1975. It was included on her album "Un ramito de violetas" "(A bouquet of violets)." This song was considered a protest song in the last years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship because of its lyrics.

"Mi querida España" was a hit in the 1970s and became a part of Spanish music history. It has become a national symbol.

In 1996 (twenty years after Cecilia's death) it was published in a tribute album titled: "Desde que tú te has ido (Since you are gone)". Several artists sang her singles in memory of Cecilia. Miguel Bosé recorded this song.

In 2015 "Mi querida España" was performed by Kiko Veneno and Rozalen for the soundtrack of the Spanish movie "Perdiendo el norte".
