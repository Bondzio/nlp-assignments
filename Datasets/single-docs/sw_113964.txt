Kowloon

Kowloon (; ) is one of the 3 main parts of Hong Kong. It comprises the Kowloon Peninsula and New Kowloon. 
Kowloon is north of Hong Kong Island and south of the mainland part of the New Territories. The size of Kowloon is about 47 square kilometres. In law, Kowloon refers to the area south of Boundary Street and Stonecutters Island, leased to the United Kingdom by the Qing dynasty in 1860. In 1898, the Qing dynasty leased the New Territories to the United Kingdom for 99 years. New Kowloon, the area north of Boundary Street, is officially part of the New Territories. In modern culture, however, New Kowloon is part of Kowloon.

Kowloon was developed largely in the 20th century, after Kowloon Wharf and Kowloon-Canton Railway were built. Aeroplanes from Kai Tak Airport used to fly above Kowloon, so buildings there are usually lower than the ones on Hong Kong Island.

The name Kowloon means "the nine dragons" â€“ eight mountains and a Chinese emperor: Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill, Crow's Nest and Emperor Bing (Song Dynasty).
2,108,419 people lived in Kowloon in 2011. 94.2% of Kowloon's residents are Chinese. Smaller groups include Indonesians (1.8%), Filipinos (1.5%), Indians (0.5%), Nepalese (0.4%), and White people (0.3%).
86% of the people Kowloon usually talk in Cantonese, 2.3% use English and 1.2% use Mandarin.
