Titanoboa

Titanoboa was the largest known snake. Now extinct, the snake was a relative of the "Anaconda" and the "Boa constrictor". It was about 43 feet long (13 m), and weighed over a ton (about 1135 kg or 2500 pounds). The snake lived in the Palaeocene epoch, about 58 million years ago. 

The fossil was found in an open-cast coal mine in Colombia, in 2009. Plant fossils at the site proved the climate at the time was a tropical rainforest. The site was in the Cerrejón Formation in La Guajira, Colombia. Other large reptile fossils have been found at this site.

Researchers found three skulls of the snake in 2002. A lifesize replica is now on view at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C.
