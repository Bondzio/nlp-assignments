Sic

Sic is a Latin word meaning "thus", "so", "as such", or "in such a manner". In writing, it is put in square brackets and italic type – ["sic"] – to show that any incorrect or unusual spelling, phrases, punctuation, or other quoted material have been copied (word for word) from its original source. 

At first, it was said like the English word "seek" (IPA /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word "sick" (/'sɪk/).

The word "sic" may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully: for instance, quoting the U.S. Constitution:

It is often used, though, to highlight an error, sometimes to ridicule, such as here in "The Times":

Sometimes, "sic" is said to be an abbreviation for "said in context", "spelled in context", "said in copy", and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used.
