North Sydney is one of only two original divisions in New South Wales, which have never been held by the ALP. It has been held by a member of a non-Labor party for all but six years, when independent Ted Mack held it. It was held after the December 1922 election by Prime Minister Billy Hughes. Hughes was replaced as Nationalist party leader, and therefore Prime Minister by Stanley Bruce in February 1923. Joe Hockey was Treasurer in the Abbott Government, but lost his position when Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister. Hockey resigned from Parliament which caused a by-election, and was then appointed as the Ambassador to the US.
