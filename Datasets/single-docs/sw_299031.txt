Pulp (fruit)

The pulp of a citrus fruit are the stringy content of the fruitâ€™s endocarp. The pulp contains the juice of the fruit. The pulp is usually removed from fruit juice by filtering it out.

The color of the pulp can change, depending on the species and the ripening stage. Usually, it has the color of the fruit's peel.

The juiciness of the pulp depends on the species, variety, season, and even the tree on which it grew.
