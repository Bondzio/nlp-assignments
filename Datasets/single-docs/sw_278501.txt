Electromagnetic Pulse

An Electromagnetic Pulse or EMP is a burst of electromagnetic radiation (light, magnetism, electricity), and is caused by a huge release of energy. A "common" cause for an electromagnetic pulse is a nuclear explosion. A scientist name Enrique Fermi predicted electromagnetic pulses from nuclear bombs before they were ever even fired. An EMP can damage electronic recording equipment and shut off digital clocks, even if they are moderately shielded.
