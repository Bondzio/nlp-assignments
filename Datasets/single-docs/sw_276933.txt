Charles, Duke of Berry

Charles of France, Duke of Berry, (31 July 1686 – 5 May 1714) was a grandson of Louis XIV of France. The Duke of Berry was for seven years heir presumptive to the throne of Spain (1700–1707) when his brother Philip V of Spain was childless.

Born at the Palace of Versailles, Charles was the youngest son of Louis, Dauphin of France, ""le Grand Dauphin"", and of Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria. 

The Duchess of Orléans proposed he marry her daughter Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans. All agreed, the marriage with Marie Louise Élisabeth took place on 6 July 1710. It was an unhappy marriage, and after a miscarriage which ended her first pregnancy, Marie Louise Élisabeth never gave birth to a child that lived for more than a few days. Once a widow, Madame de Berry became ill-famous for her debauched lifeways. She hid several pregnancies and died at 23 a few weeks after suffering a harrowing clandestine childbirth. Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchess Dowager of Orléans and the grandmother of Berry's wife, nicknamed him ""Berry-Bon Cœur"" ("Berry Good Heart").
