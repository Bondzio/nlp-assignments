Miss Universe

Miss Universe is an international beauty contest. It was started in 1952 and today has over 190 countries taking part. About one billion people watch it on television every year.

The pageant is owned by WME and IMG. Until 2015, it was owned by NBC and Donald Trump. In 2015, Trump started his campaign for President of the United States and said he wanted to stop illegal immigrants from Mexico from coming into the US. NBC then stopped working with him, and so Trump bought Miss Universe out, and sold it to its current owners a few days later.
The most recent person to receive the Miss Universe title is Iris Mittenaere of France, who did so on January 30, 2017 in Manila, Philippines.
