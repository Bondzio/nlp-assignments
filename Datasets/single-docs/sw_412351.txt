Amazing Alex

Amazing Alex, which is developed by Rovio, is a puzzle game.

In Google Play, this game is rated as 4.3 out of 5 stars.

In Pocket Gamer, Harry Slater, a player of this game, prefers "Angry Birds" to "Amazing Alex". He said, "That's not to say that Amazing Alex isn't an addictive experience - it's just that compared to Angry Birds, there's less excitement involved. You rarely feel like throwing your arms in the air when you've completed a puzzle, for example, and the absence of any kind of antagonist reduces the stakes slightly."
