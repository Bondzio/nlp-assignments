Myanmar at the Olympics

Myanmar, also known as "Burma", was first at the Olympic Games in 1948.

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Myanmar is MYA. In 1964, it was BUR for Burma.

Athletes from this country have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1976 Games. The nation has never been in the Winter Olympic Games. Since the 1992 Games, the nation has been named "Myanmar" in Olympic competition.

As of 2011, no Burmese athlete has ever won an Olympic medal.

The National Olympic Committee for Myanmar was formed in 1947 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee that same year.
