Tribute in Light

The Tribute in Light is a memorial with two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky done to remember the September 11 attacks. It is lit up at dusk every September 11, lasting until dawn the next day. It is done by the Municipal Art Society of New York. It was first done on March 11, 2002, six months after the attacks happened, and lasted until April 14, 2002. It was done again on the second anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2003. Since then, it has been done on every September 11.

On clear nights, the lights can be seen from over 60 miles away. It can be seen in all of New York City, as well as most of Northern New Jersey and Long Island, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Westchester County, New York, Orange County, New York and Rockland County, New York.
