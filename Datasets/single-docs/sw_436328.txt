Bryce Canyon National Park

Bryce Canyon National Park is a national park in southwestern Utah. Its major feature is Bryce Canyon.

Despite its name, this is not a canyon but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is known for its "hoodoos". The hoodoos are badlands formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks. 

The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce is much higher than nearby Zion National Park. The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2,400 to 2,700 m).
