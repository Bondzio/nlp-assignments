6th G7 summit

The 6th G7 summit was a meeting in 1980 for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The international group of leaders were together in Italy on June 22-23. The meetings were held in Venice.

The Venice summit of the Group of Seven (G7) was the 6th meeting in a series which began in 1976. 

This was the first G7 summit hosted by Italy.

The G8 and the summit are part of a consultation process. The G8 is not an international organization. It is an informal group.

The participants were the "core members" of the group:

Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira had a fatal heart attack only 10 days before the summit. The Foreign Minister led the Japanese delegation.

The G7 leaders agreed to work together to break the link between oil consumption and economic growth. Medium- and long-term policies were identified as important issues.
