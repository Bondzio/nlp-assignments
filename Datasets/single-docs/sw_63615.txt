Conquistador

A Conquistador (English: "Conqueror"; : "Conquistadores", or "Conquistadors") was a Spanish soldier, explorer and adventurer. The "Conquistadors" invaded and conquered much of the Americas and the Philippines Islands and other islands in Asia Pacific. Many of them were "hidalgos" (noblemen of low category).

Their conquests brought these lands under Spanish colonial rule between the 15th and 17th centuries, starting with the 1492 settlement by Christopher Columbus in what is now the Bahamas. They created what is now called Latin America.

The first immensely successful conquistador was Hernán Cortés. Between 1520 and 1521, Cortés, along with native enemies of the Aztecs, conquered the mighty Aztec Empire. Present day Mexico came under the dominion of the Spanish Empire, as New Spain. Francisco Pizarro later found and conquered the similarly large Inca Empire.
