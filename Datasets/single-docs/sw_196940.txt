Doug Bentley

Douglas Wagner Bentley (September 3, 1916 – November 24 1972) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers. Bentley missed the entire 1944–45 NHL season after being given permission to stay home and tend the family farm by Canadian Armed Forces officials, September, 1944.

From 1940 to 1947, his brother Max Bentley was his teammate and linemate in Chicago. Both brothers have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and in 1998, both brothers were named to "The Hockey News"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, Max at number 48 and Doug at number 73.
On March 13, 1966 in an Eastern Hockey League game vs Jacksonville, Doug Bentley inserted his son, Doug Jr. (b. June 1, 1951) into the game when the team was short of players due to injuries. Doug Jr. was only 14 years of age at the time, becoming the youngest player to play a shift in a professional hockey league.
