Krispy Kreme

Krispy Kreme is the name of an international chain of doughnut shops that was made by Vernon Rudolph in 1937. The real parent company of Krispy Kreme is Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc.

While selling all types of doughnuts, Krispy Kreme's signature is a glazed doughnut that is traditionally served warm.

Loblaws supermarkets and Petro-Canada gas stations in Canada have Krispy Kreme. In the United Kingdom Tesco supermarkets, Tesco Extra and Moto service stations carry Krispy Kreme products.
On May 6, 2008, the first Krispy Kreme shop in Puerto Rico opened, followed by two additional places in 2010 and one location in 2011.

In 2002, Krispy Kreme opened a restaurant-style shop in the Amarillo area in Texas.

The 18 stores that opened in Canada were reduced to four. Two of them are in Quebec while the other two stores are in Mississauga, Ontario and Delta, British Columbia. A small seasonal shop was recently opened in Wasaga Beach, Ontario. The Wasaga Beach receives its doughnuts from the Mississauga shop every morning. Another small store recently opened on November 3, 2010 in Toronto at Bathurst and Harbord Streets in the city's Harbord Village neighborhood. This store got shipments from the Mississauga store. Krispy Kreme's Canadian assets were put up for sale in 2005 seven weeks after the U.S.-based doughnut company had the firm that owns the stores in Canada placed under bankruptcy protection.

In Japan, over 27 shops of Krispy Kreme doughnuts opened around the country.
