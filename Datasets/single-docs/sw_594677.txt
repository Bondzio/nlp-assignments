Dominick Cirillo

Dominick Vincent "Quiet Dom" Cirillo (born July 4, 1929) is an American gangster. He is a high-ranking member of the Genovese crime family, who briefly served as acting boss for the imprisoned Boss Vincent "Chin" Gigante. He was born in Harlem, New York. 

Cirillo represented the Genoveses in their dealings with the other Mafia families of New York City after Gigante was jailed, though Gigante remained in overall charge of the family. In this way, Cirillo served as "acting boss", and was seen by US authorities as the most powerful member of the Genovese family. However, in 1998 Cirillo stepped down as acting boss because of a heart attack.

On August 22, 2008, the 79-year-old Cirillo was released from federal prison after serving more than three years.
