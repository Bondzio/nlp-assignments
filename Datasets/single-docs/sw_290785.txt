Polemic

A polemic is a forceful argument or controversy made against one opinion, doctrine, or person. 

It is one-sided and extreme, not a debate or discussion. It often occurs in disputes. 

The word is derived from the Greek "polemikos" (πολεμικός), meaning "warlike, hostile". 

Polemic journalism was common in continental Europe, when libel laws were not as stringent. 

To support study of the polemics and controversies of the 17th-19th centuries, a British research project has placed thousands of pamphlets of that era online.
