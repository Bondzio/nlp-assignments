Morocco at the Olympics

Morocco at the Olympics is a history which began in 1959. 

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Morocco is MRC.

A team from Morocco was first at the Olympic Games in 1960. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. Morocco also boycotted the 1976 Games, withdrawing after having initially sent a delegation. Only one Moroccon representative had time to compete before his country's withdrawal: Abderahim Najim took part in the Men's Light Flyweight event in boxing, and lost his first and only match.

Morocco has been in the Winter Olympic Games four times since 1968, but not since 1992.

Moroccan athletes have won a total of twenty two medals, nineteen in athletics and three in boxing.

The National Olympic Committee for Morocco was formed in 1959.
