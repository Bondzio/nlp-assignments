I Think I'm a Clone Now

"I Think I'm a Clone Now" is a song by "Weird Al" Yankovic. It is a parody of "I Think We're Alone Now", which was originally recorded by Tommy James & The Shondells. Yankovic's parody seems to have been based more on the 1987 cover by Tiffany. It was released on the 1988 album "Even Worse".
