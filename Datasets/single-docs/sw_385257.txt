Cuboid bone

The cuboid is one of the many bones of the feet. It is located on the side of the foot. It articulates (connects with) metatarsals number 4 and 5. Ligaments help hold the foot in an arched position and to hold the metatarsals and medial bones (one of many is the cuboid) together. Most likely, the name cuboid comes from the fact that the cuboid bone is shaped kind of like a cube.
