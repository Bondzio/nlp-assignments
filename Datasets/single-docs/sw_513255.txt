All for You (Janet Jackson album)

All for You is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson. Released on April 24, 2001 by Virgin Records. The album was recorded during Jackson's separation from then-husband Ren√© Elizondo, Jr. The album is mainly more dance-pop tinged hip hop and R&B than her previous album "The Velvet Rope" (1997).


"All for You" was re-released with two additional remixes and a limited edition bonus DVD. It was announced on October 21, 2001 via "Billboard", and released on November 20, 2001. The new version features alternate artwork in addition to the "Flyte Tyme" single edit and Diddy remix of the album's third single, "Son of a Gun." It also includes a bonus DVD of Jackson's videography. It was intended to include a twenty-four page photo booklet of Jackson's All for You Tour, however, it was omitted for unknown reasons. The re-release contains the edited version of the album, which omits the song "Would You Mind."

The DVD, titled "Janet: The Virgin Years", includes fifteen music videos released throughout Jackson's involvement with Virgin Records, including the album's hits "Someone to Call My Lover" and "All for You." It also includes exclusive tour audition footage, in addition to behind-the-scenes clips and Jackson's performance on "MTV Icon: Janet Jackson". Promotional footage for each of her albums are featured, focusing on interviews and touring.
