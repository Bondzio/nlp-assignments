Airbus A340

The Airbus A340 is a long-range four-engined widebody commercial passenger airplane manufactured by Airbus S.A.S. a subsidiary of EADS. It is similar in design to the twin-engined A330.

There are 4 variants of this model:
The A340-200 (which is the shortest), the A340-300, the A340-500 and the longest one the A340-600. The A340-600 is the second longest passenger plane in the world. 

Having four engines, the A340 uses more fuel than many other aircrafts.However, that also mean it does not have to pass the ETOPS(extended range twin operations)test to fly long range. 

The Airbus A340 is now not made anymore.
