Nikola Bizumić

Nikola Bizumić was born in 1823 in Neradin, Serbia and lived the life of a rural peasant by breeding pigs. Bizumic wanted to leave that lifestyle, so he fled to the city of Ruma where he met barber Petar Javonovic and became his apprentice. Eventually, Bizumic developed the first pair of manual hair clippers before his death in 1906.
