Sri Lanka Railways S11

Sri Lanka Railways Class S11 is a diesel multiple-unit (DMU) train, built for Sri Lanka Railways by RITES Ltd, an Indian state infrastructure corporation. The DMUs are currently being imported in phases, with the last batch arriving in Sri Lanka in March 2012. They were built to replace locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Twenty S11 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long distance travel on the Coastal railway line from Colombo to Matara.
