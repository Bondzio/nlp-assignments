North Hollywood shootout

The North Hollywood shootout was a gunfight that happened on February 28, 1997. Emil Matasareanu and Larry Eugene Phillips were the bank robbers, and used AK-47s, an AR-15, an HK-91, and 9 MM pistols. The police could not kill them because of their heavy body armour, which was made out of kevlar. 20 people were wounded, and the only two killed were the robbers.

Larry Eugene Phillips Jr (1970-1997) shot himself in the head with a Beretta M92F after being injured multiple times. His body was left in the street for about an hour before ambulances came to take his body away.
