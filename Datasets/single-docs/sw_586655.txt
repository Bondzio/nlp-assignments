George Foster Peabody

George Foster Peabody (July 27, 1852 â€“ March 4, 1938) was an American banker and philanthropist.

Peabody retired from business in 1906 to pursue a life of public service. Long interested in social causes, he supported such progressive ideas as the single tax as advocated by Henry George in his book "Progress and Poverty", free trade, women's suffrage and government ownership of railroads. He was also active in the anti-war movement.

Perhaps Peabody's best-known legacy is the George Foster Peabody Awards, presented annually since 1941 by the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication for excellence in radio, and, since 1948

Peabody died on March 4, 1938 at his home in Warm Springs, Georgia at the age of 85.
