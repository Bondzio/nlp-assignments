Japanese Occupation of Singapore

The Japanese Occupation of Singapore is a time from 1942-1945 (during World War II) where the Japanese occupied Singapore. The occupation started after the army of Japan defeated the garrison of Australian, British Malaya, Britain, and India. This was at the Battle of Singapore. It was officially returned to the British after the peace treaty ending World War II was signed. 

The Japanese did not treat the people very well during their occupation. They tried to kill all anti-Japanese people. There was a large amount of inflation because the Japanese printed paper money for Singapore to use.

In 1941, due to the weak defenses of the country, the Japanese attacked Singapore. They took control of the colony on 15 February 1942 and renamed it Syonan-to (pronounced as Sio-nan-to), meaning Light of the South, during the rule. Many people suffered during this time till the British got back Singapore in September 1945.
