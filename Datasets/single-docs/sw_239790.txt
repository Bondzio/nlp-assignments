Conspiracy of One

Conspiracy of One is the sixth album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 2000. The album debuted at 9 on the US Billboard 200 with around 125,000 copies sold in its first week and has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. It is the follow-up to the commercially successful "Americana".

The Offspring had come out in support of file sharing, claiming it does not hurt sales. This album was originally planned to be released directly on their website before retail, until their label threatened to sue.

"Conspiracy of One" is also the band's final studio album with the most successful line-up, as drummer Ron Welty left band in early 2003 to pursue his career with Steady Ground.
