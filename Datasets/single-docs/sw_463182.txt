Julio Jaramillo

Julio Alfredo Jaramillo Laurido (October 1, 1935 – February 9, 1978) was a famous Ecuadorian singer and recording artist. He performed throughout Latin America. He received great fame for his music of boleros, valses, pasillos, tangos, and rancheras.

Having recorded more than 4,000 songs throughout his career, his most famous song was perhaps "Nuestro Juramento" written by Puerto Rican composer, Benito de Jesús.

Jaramillo died from liver sclerosis at the age of 42 in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
