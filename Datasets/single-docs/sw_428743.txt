Robert G. Heft

Robert G. "Bob" Heft (January 19, 1941 â€“ December 12, 2009) was the designer of the current United States 50-star flag. He has also designed a 51-star flag that would be used if a new state joins the United States. He was born in Saginaw, Michigan.

Heft designed the current United States flag as a school project in Lancaster, Ohio when he was 17 years old. He got a B- for his project by his teacher, Stanley Pratt. After talking about the project, he made an agreement with his teacher that if the flag was made as the official flag by the United States Congress, he would get a better grade for the project. Heft's design was chosen out of more than 1,500 designs that were given to United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and his teacher changed his grade to an A.

After graduating from college, he became a high school teacher and later a college professor. He was also mayor of Napoleon, Ohio for 28 years.

Heft died on December 12, 2009 from a heart attack while living in Saginaw. This happened after many years of fighting with diabetes. He was 68 years old.
