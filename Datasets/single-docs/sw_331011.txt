Baltimore Colts

The Baltimore Colts were an American football franchise in the National Football League. The team was based in Baltimore. The logo was a white horseshoe (blue uniforms). The team had success since 1953 when it began, winning four NFL championships, including Super Bowl V. The most famous player was quarterback Johnny Unitas. However, in 1984, Bob Irsay secretly (meaning in the middle of a March night without an announcement) moved the team to Indianapolis to begin play as the Indianapolis Colts.
