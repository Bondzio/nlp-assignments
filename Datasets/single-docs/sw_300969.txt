Bit rate

In telecommunications and computing, the bit rate (sometimes bitrate), or data rate, is the amount of data that can be transported or processed in a given amount of time. This is different from, but related to, the symbol rate and the bandwidth. The data rate is usually measured in "bits per second" ("bit/s"); sometimes this is qualified with a SI prefix. Note that kilo has the usual meaning of 1000, and not 1024, as was often used in computing.
