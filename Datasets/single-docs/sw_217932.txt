Hurricane David

Hurricane David was the strongest and deadliest hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, but not the costliest. This hurricane caused a lot of damage as it slammed into Dominican Republic as a category 5 hurricane and was it struck Florida as a category 2 hurricane. Hurricane David killed 2,068 and caused over $1.5 billion in damage. 

Because it killed so many people in Dominican Republic, the name David was retired. This was the first male name retired in the Atlantic Ocean. Meaning, David will never be used as a name of a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. The name Danny replaced it in 1985, 1991, 1997, 2003, and 2009. The name Danny is also on the list in 2015.Hurricane David was a very strong hurricane killing many.
