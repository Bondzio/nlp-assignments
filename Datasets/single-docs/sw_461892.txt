Brasserie

Brasserie, in France and nowadays in Britain, means a type of French restaurant. It has a relaxed setting, and serves single dishes and other meals. The word 'brasserie' is also French for "brewery". In the beginning, it was used for the place where the beer was brewed. Often these places served the beer they brewed, together with a meal. 

A brasserie has professional service, printed menus, and (traditionally) white linenâ€”unlike a bistro which may have none of these. Typically, a brasserie is open every day of the week and serves the same menu all day.

In 1901 "Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language" defined 'brasserie' as "in France, any beer-garden or saloon". In 2000 "The New Penguin English Dictionary" had this definition of 'brasserie': "a small informal French-style restaurant".
