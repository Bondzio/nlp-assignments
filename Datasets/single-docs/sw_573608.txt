Arnold Spielberg

Arnold Meyer Spielberg (born February 6, 1917) is an American electrical engineer of Jewish descent.

He was known for his help "to real-time data acquisition and recording that significantly contributed to the definition of modern feedback and control processes". For General Electric he designed, with his colleague Charles Propster, the GE-225 in 1959. He said that his greatest contribution was to be the first computer-controlled "point of sale" cash register. 

He is the father of movie director Steven Spielberg.
