Ilha da Queimada Grande

Ilha da Queimada Grande is an island off of the coast of SÃ£o Paulo state in Brazil. The island has earned the nickname of Snake Island. It is the home of the Golden Lancehead Viper ("Bothrops insularis"), one of the most venomous snakes in the world. The Brazilian Navy bans people from visiting, though some biologists and researchers are able to receive waivers to visit the island.
