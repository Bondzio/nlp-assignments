Hitler Youth

The Hitler Youth was an organization in Nazi Germany for children from ages 10 to 18. The girls split off from the Hitler Youth when they were 14 to join The League of German Maidens. All German children between these ages whom Adolf Hitler considered to be "pure blooded" (blonde hair and blue eyes) were required to join, and parents who stopped their children from joining could be sent to prison for a long time. In order to get rid of any distractions or other groups that might keep children from being involved with the Hitler Youth, Hitler banned all other youth groups or clubs. The Hitler youth also prepared boys for the army and taught them how to use weapons.

The purpose of the Hitler Youth was to train children to accept values such as duty to the Nazi Party and to Hitler, and to teach them to be prepared even to give their lives for their country. Many children died because of the Hitler Youth.
