Mary Jane (shoe)

Mary Janes are low-cut, rounded-toed shoes that are worn almost entirely by girls or women. They are usually low or mid heeled, though there are some that are high heeled. The shoes have one thin strap over the instep of the foot. They are made almost exclusively of leather. These shoes are worn at school, in church or during work (for certain places), and with skirts, dresses and certain types of pants.
