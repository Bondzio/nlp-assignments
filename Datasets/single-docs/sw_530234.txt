Socialist Campaign Group

The Socialist Campaign Group is a left-wing, democratic socialist group of Labour Party Members of Parliament in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. It was formed in December 1982 as an alternative Parliamentary left-wing group to the Tribune Group. The Campaign Group, as it is commonly known, is often considered on the hard left of the Labour Party and has been very critical of New Labour.
