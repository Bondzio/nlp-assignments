Volksschule

A Volkschule was part of an 18th-century system of state-supported primary schools established in the Habsburg Austrian Empire. Attendance was supposed to be compulsory. However, a 1781 census found that only one fourth of the school-age children attended. At the time, this was one of the few examples of state-supported schooling.

The Volkschule still exist in Austria today, "Volksschule" is the Austrian equivalent to the German word "Grundschule" and the Swiss German word "Primarschule", i.e. primary school.
