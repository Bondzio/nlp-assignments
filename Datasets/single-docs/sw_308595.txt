Rhipidistia

The Rhipidistia are lobe-finned fish, and include the ancestors of the tetrapods. The Rhipidistia are a subgroup of Sarcopterygii which includes the lungfish (Dipnoi) and the tetrapodomorphs.

As cladistic understanding of the vertebrates has improved over the last few decades a monophyletic Rhipidistia is now understood to include the ancestor of the whole Tetrapoda.
