Cubic metre

The cubic metre (symbol m³) is the SI unit of volume. Since a "cube" is a shape formed by having the same length, breadth and height, a cubic metre refers to a unit of volume that is one metre in length, breadth and height (1m). In other words, it is a cube with a length of one metre, with 1,000 litres of space.

In the United States it is spelled "cubic meter". Other names are stère and kilolitre, spelled kiloliter in the United States.

1 cubic metre equals:

A cubic metre of pure water at the temperature of maximum density (3.98 °C) and standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) has a mass of 1000 kg, or one tonne. At 0 °C, the freezing point of water, it is slightly less, 999.972 kg.

It is sometimes abbreviated cu m, m3, m^3 or m**3 when superscript characters or markup are not available/accessible (i.e. in some typewritten documents and postings in Usenet newsgroups).

Abbreviated CBM in the freight business and MTQ (or numeric code 49) in international trade.
