Cross product

The cross product is a mathematical operation which can be done between two vectors. After performing the cross product, a new vector is formed. The cross product of two vectors is always perpendicular to both of the vectors which were "crossed". This means that the cross product must always be used in 3-Dimensional space.

Being a vector operation, the cross product is extremely important in all sorts of sciences (particularly physics), engineering, and mathematics. One important example of the cross product is in torque or moment.

Like any mathematical operation, the cross product can be done in a straightforward way.

If
formula_1
and
formula_2
then
formula_3

or

formula_4
and
formula_5

formula_6 is just a symbol which says that our new vector is pointing up (in the z-direction). If you "cross" two vectors which are both in the x-y plane, the product will always be perpendicular to both vectors, and if both vectors are in the x-y plane, the only way for it to be perpendicular to both is to be in the z direction. If the value of formula_7 is positive, then it points OUT of the page; if its value is negative, then it points INTO the page.

If 
formula_8
and 
formula_9
then
formula_10

formula_11

formula_12

formula_13
