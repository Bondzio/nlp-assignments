Just Say No

"Just Say No" was an advertising campaign, part of the U.S. "War on Drugs", dominant during the 1980s and early 1990s, to discourage children from engaging in illegal recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying no. This also expanded the realm of "Just Say No" to violence and premarital sex. The slogan was created by First Lady of the United States Nancy Reagan during her husband, Ronald Reagan, presidency.
