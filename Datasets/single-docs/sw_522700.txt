Great Wall

The Great Walls are the largest known structures in the universe. They are based on data set mapping of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The mapping found an unusually high concentration of similarly distanced GRBs in certain areas. 

Structures larger than 1,200,000,000 light years are incompatible with the cosmological principle according to all estimates.
