German Cross

The German Cross () was begun by Adolf Hitler on 16 November 1941 as an award that was a higher level than the Iron Cross First Class but below the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. It was given in two classes: gold and silver (the color of the laurel around the swastika), the gold was given out for bravery, the silver was given out for service.
This award was also available in cloth, which made for easier wear on the combat uniform.

The title of the award is taken from the fact that the swastika is a type of cross.
