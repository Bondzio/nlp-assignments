Okinotorishima

Okinotorishima is one of the Pacific Ocean islands known as Ogasawara, Tokyo.

Japan claims the waters around the island as an Exclusive Economic Zone {EEZ); but this is disputed by China.

The Japanese government identifies Okinotori as Japan's southernmost island. It is 1,700 kilometres south of central Tokyo.

Okinotori is at a militarily strategic point. It is midway between Taiwan and Guam.
