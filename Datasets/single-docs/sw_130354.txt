Good Girl Gone Bad

Good Girl Gone Bad is the third studio album released by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. The singles from the album include (from the original version of the album) "Umbrella", "Breakin' Dishes", "Shut Up and Drive", "Hate That I Love You", "Don't Stop the Music", and "Rehab". The album is a change from the reggae sound of Rihanna's previous albums for a more pop, dance-pop and R&B album.

Rihanna did a worldwide concert tour on September 15, three months after the release of the album. The tour had three parts with sixty-one shows. It ended on April 5, 2008. The first part of the tour began in Canada. It included eleven shows across the country with Akon. The tour later went through United States and Europe without Akon.
Supporting acts for the tour were Akon, Ciara and David Jordan.
