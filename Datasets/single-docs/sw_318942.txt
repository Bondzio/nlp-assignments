Wilson's bird-of-paradise

The Wilson's bird-of-paradise is a small bird of the Paradisaeidae family.

The male is a red and black bird-of-paradise with a yellow mantle on its neck, a light-green mouth, blue feet and two curved violet tail feathers. The head is naked blue with a black double cross pattern on it. 

As so often with birds in general, and paradise birds in particular, the female is not showy. It is a brownish bird, though it does have a bare blue crown.

Wilson's bird-of-paradise eat usually fruit or small insects.
