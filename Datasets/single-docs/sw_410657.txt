Jokichi Ikarashi

Jokichi Ikarashi (五十嵐 丈吉 Jōkichi Ikarashi; 26 January 1902 – 23 July 2013) was a Japanese supercentenarian who was the world's oldest verified living man after the death of 111-year-old James McCoubrey on July 5, 2013. He remained as the oldest living man until his own death 18 days later at the age of 111 years, 178 days. However, two days after Ikarashi's death, the Gerontology Research Group confirmed the longevity of New York man Salustiano Sanchez, who was born on 8 June 1901, making Ikarashi the second-oldest man at the time of his death.

Ikarashi also became the oldest living man in Japan upon the death of 116-year-old Jiroemon Kimura on June 12, 2013. Ikarashi had four children, eleven grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, and one great-great grandchild.
