Ottawa Redblacks

The Ottawa Redblacks is a professional Canadian football team in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The team is part of the East Division of the Canadian Football League. It plays its home games in TD Place Stadium.

There were two other CFL teams in Ottawa before the Redblacks started. The original CFL team, the Ottawa Rough Riders, folded in 1996. A second team, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2006. The Redblacks team was formed in 2008, but problems with the team's stadium kept the team from playing until the 2014 CFL season.
