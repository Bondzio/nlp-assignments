Copa América Centenario

The Copa América Centenario (English: Centennial Copa America) was a men's association football tournament that took place from 3 June to 26 June 2016. The tournament was made to celebrate 100 years of the Copa América. It was hosted in the United States for the first time.

Chile won the final in penalties over Argentina (which was a repeat of the 2015 Copa América Final).

The winner of the tournament will not qualify for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup because Chile already won the 2015 Copa América.
