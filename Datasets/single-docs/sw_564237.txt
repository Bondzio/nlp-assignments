Al-Masih ad-Dajjal

Al-Masih ad-Dajjal ( "", "the false messiah", or "the deceiver") is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology. He is to appear, pretending to be "al-Masih" (i.e. the Messiah), before "Yawm al-Qiyamah" (the Day of Resurrection). According to Islamic belief, at the end of days he will gather together everyone he has deceived into a great army. His army will then confront the Messiah and his army. The Dajjal is not mentioned directly in the Qur'an. This may be because he is only human and is mentioned in the future.
