Tin(IV) fluoride

Tin(IV) fluoride, also known as stannic fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SnF. It contains tin and fluoride ions. The tin is in its +4 oxidation state.

Tin(IV) fluoride is a colorless solid. Its melting point is very high. It reacts with alkali metal fluorides like potassium fluoride to make hexafluorostannates, compounds that have the SnF ion in them. 

Tin(IV) fluoride is made by reacting tin and fluorine. It can also be made by reacting hydrogen fluoride with tin(IV) chloride. 

It is sometimes used in toothpaste, although tin(II) fluoride is more common.
