Interracial marriage

An interracial marriage is a marriage between two people of different races. In some countries, it is against the law to marry someone of a different race. These countries include, Germany (during the Nazi period), South Africa under apartheid, and some U.S. states in the United States before a 1969 ruling. In some Arab countries, it is forbidden for an Arab to marry outside their race because of the law and traditional customs. If an Arab person marries someone out of their race their civil rights are taken away from them. In 2008, Pakistani senators allowed women to be buried alive, if found guilty, of marrying someone outside their race.
