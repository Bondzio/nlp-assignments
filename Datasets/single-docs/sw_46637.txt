Service (economics)

In economics and marketing, a service is an economic activity (e.g., labor) offered as a product. Although a service (i.e., the activity) is a non-material good, the result it produces may be a material good depending on the service. For example, a construction service may produce a material good, but a lawn mowing service may not. In most cases, the person or company buying the service does not obtain exclusive ownership of the service, but may take ownership of the material good, if one is produced.

Services can be described in terms of their main attributes.
