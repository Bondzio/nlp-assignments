WYSIWYG

WYSIWYG ( or ), is an acronym for "What You See Is What You Get", used in computing to describe a system where things you edit on the on-screen editor appear almost the same to the final output, which might be a printed document, a web page, a PowerPoint presentation or even the lighting for a concert. Web designers often use this word to talk about their work.
