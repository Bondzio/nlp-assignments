Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?

Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? is a song from the Walt Disney animated short movie "Three Little Pigs" (1933). It was written by Frank Churchill and Ann Ronell. The song buoyed spirits during the Great Depression. It inspired the title of Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1963).
