SimCity DS

SimCity DS, or SimCity Creator, is a simulation video game made in 2007 by Electronic Arts. The player can build a city, while trying to keep it healthy.

The player will be known as the "Mayor" throughout the game. They will have to look at five sheets to run their city.

Zones are the places where buildings can develop. They are different, and the "heavier" the zone, the more buildings grow. However, land value has a greater effect.

Certain facilities are called "needs". Power and water are considered "needs" in the game, although one is not completely mandatory.

"Advisers" are people you choose to help you build a city.
