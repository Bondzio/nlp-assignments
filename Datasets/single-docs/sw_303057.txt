Hockenheim was first mentioned 769 as "Ochinheim" in a document of the Lorsch Codex (a list of early monastery gifts). The name "Hockenheim" was first used in official documents in 1238. During the Middle Ages, Hockenheim was owned by several local authorities.
In the 17th century, Hockenheim was severely destroyed twice by French troops. In 1644 during the Thirty Years' War, and in 1674 during the Franco-Dutch War. Tobacco was brought to the area by the French. During this time, the growing of hops started to be replaced with tobacco. In 1803 Hockenheim was merged into Baden. The tobacco crop grew well and prospered, and Hockenheim was awarded town rights on 22 July 1895.

At the beginning of the 20th century, asparagus growing replaced most of the remaining hops growing. On 29 May 1932 the Hockenheimring opened with a motorcycle race. In January 1973, Hockenheim was assigned to the new Rhein-Neckar-Kreis (district).
