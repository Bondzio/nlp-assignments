In 1867, the town had a boom in population when gold and silver were found in the area. Silver was also found at nearby Toad Mountain in 1886. This helped with the population boom and incorporated the town in 1897. Nelson was named after the Lieutenant-Governor of BC, Hugh Nelson. Many American draft dodgers during the Vietnam War settled in and around Nelson.

Historic Baker Street is in Nelson. Steve Martin filmed his 1987 movie "Roxanne" in Nelson which helped Nelson transform from a resource-based town to an arts and tourism town. Parts of the movie "Snow Falling on Cedars" and "The Tall Man" (2012 film) were shot in Nelson.
