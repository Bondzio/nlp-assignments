Fernando Pessoa

Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa (Lisbon, 13 June 1888 - Lisbon, 30 November 1935), also known as Fernando Pessoa, was a Portuguese poet and writer. 

Pessoa is considered one of the greatest Portuguese poets. He has been compared to Luís Vaz de Camões. His works reflect the infuence of classic tradition and French symbolism and his poetry reflects nostalgia. 

He is famous for having written under 73 different names. Each had its own presumed biography, physical qualities, relationship to the others, poetic voice, and point of view. Pessoa believed that a person could have more than one integrated personality. His work was also influenced by the English language which he learned in South Africa, where he spent a great part of his youth. 

He died of liver disease at age 47 in Lisbon. His last words were in English: ""I know not what tomorrow will bring..."." 

Among Pessoa's poems in English, there are "Sonnets" (1918), "English Poems" (1922), and "Mensagem" (1934).
