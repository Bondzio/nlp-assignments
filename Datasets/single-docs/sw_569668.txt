Sachet d'epice

A sachet d'Ã©pices (pronounced "sa-SHAY DAY-pees") is a small cheesecloth sack containing herbs and spices. It is used to add flavor to stocks, soups and sauces. It means "bag of spices" in French.

It is often referred to simply as a "sachet". It is used like a "bouquet garni", but a sachet's ingredients are enclosed in cheesecloth while a bouquet garni is not. This means that spices such as whole peppercorns and dried herbs, which couldn't be used in a bouquet garni, can go in a sachet.
