Apollo 8

Apollo 8 was a mission in the Apollo program in December 1968. It was the first manned spaceflight to leave Earth orbit and first to orbit the Moon. Commander Frank Borman, Pilot Jim Lovell and Bill Anders transmitted a television show while they were in orbit. The kind of spaceship that could land on the Moon had not yet been built, so they photographed and studied the Moon from above. After that, they fired their rockets and returned to Earth.
