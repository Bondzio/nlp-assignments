Renault Mégane

The Renault Mégane is a automobile produced by Renault in three generations since 1995.

The first Mégane arrived in late 1995 to replace the 19. It came in many bodystyles and engines, the model formed the basis for the Scenic, Europe's first compact MPV which arrived in late 1996. The range was facelifted in April 1999 and an estate/wagon version appeared but wasn't sold in the UK. Although a new Mégane arrived in late 2002, the original was sold into 2003 until all bodystyles were redesigned. 



The second Mégane arrived in late 2002 with the hatchback models, other versions appeared during 2003. The hatchback models became known for their distinctive rear end styling which resulted in Renault doing an advert for it based on that. It was facelifted in early 2006. 



The third Mégane arrived in late 2008 with the hatchback and coupe models. Other models arrived during 2009. It received a mild facelift in 2012 then a more thorough one in late 2013. It entered its fourth generation in 2016.
