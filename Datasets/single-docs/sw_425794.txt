Rick Ross

William Roberts Leonard II(born January 28, 1976), better known by the stage name Rick Ross, is an American rapper and former civil servant. He is the founder of Maybach Music Group. This group has helped release three of Ross' albums, including "Deeper Than Rap" (2009), "Teflon Don" (2010), and "God Forgives, I Don't" (2013). MTV named him the "Hottest MC in the Game" in 2012.

In July 2008, "The Smoking Gun" claimed that Ross used to work in a prison. They also released a photograph of him in prison officer clothes. At first, Ross said that that was a lie; but after more proof was published in the media, Ross admitted to having worked as a correctional officer in Florida before.
