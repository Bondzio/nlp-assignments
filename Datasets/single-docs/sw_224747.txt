Eleventh grade

Eleventh grade (called Grade 11 in some places, also known as junior year in the United States and Australia) is the second to last year of secondary education in the United States, as well as many other nations. Students are usually 16 or 17 years old at this time, though it may be different because of the country or their birthdays.
