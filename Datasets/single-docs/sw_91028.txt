BÃ¼rgermeister

The German word Burgermeister often spelled in English as "Burgomaster" or "Burgomeister" means "master of the citizens".

A Burgermeister is chairman of the executive council (or cabinet) in many towns and cities in Germany. In France, the person is called a "mairie". In the Netherlands the person is called the "burgemeester". The title is usually translated into English as "Mayor", but the position of mayor is not quite the same as the Burgermeister.


"Ober-" is put in front of many title to show that it is higher than another, especially in military.
