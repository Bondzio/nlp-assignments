European Grand Prix

The European Grand Prix (sometimes called the Grand Prix of Europe) is a Formula One race. It was reintroduced during the mid-1980s. It has been held regularly since 1999. 

In earlier years, one of the national Grands Prix was also called the "European" Grand Prix. The first race to be so named was the 1923 Italian Grand Prix, held at Monza and won by Carlo Salamano in a Fiat. Since , the European Grand Prix is a separate race. It is usually held in a country that also holds a national Grand Prix.
