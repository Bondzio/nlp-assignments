International Day Against Homophobia

International Day Against Homophobia is a day for campaigning against homophobia and transphobia held every May 17. On this day in 1990, the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases, where it was listed as a mental illness. The Declaration of Montreal demands all countries to recognize this day, and the European Union and Brazil have already recognized formally this memorial day.
