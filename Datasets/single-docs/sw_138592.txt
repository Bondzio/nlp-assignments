WrestleMania IX

WrestleMania IX was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on April 4, 1993 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was the ninth WrestleMania event held by the WWF.

The main event saw Yokozuna defeat Bret Hart to win the WWF Championship. Yokozuna won the match by pinfall after Yokozuna's manager Mr. Fuji threw salt in Hart's eyes. After the match, Hulk Hogan came down to the ring to check on Hart. Mr. Fuji challenged Hogan to face Yokozuna in a impromptu match and Hogan accepted. Hogan won the match and the championship in 22 seconds after he hit Yokozuna with the leg drop and pinned him. 

WrestleMania IX received negative criticism and was called a poorly booked event. John Powell of SLAM! Wrestling said that other than the Intercontinental and Tag Team Championship matches and the women that accompanied Lex Luger to the ring, the rest of the pay-per-view was not good. He also did not like some of the outfits that were worn at the event, most notably Jim Ross's toga and Giant Gonzalez's spray-painted suit.
