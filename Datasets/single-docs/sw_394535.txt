The Rev

James Owen Sullivan (February 9, 1981 â€“ December 28, 2009), known by his stage name The Reverend Tholomew Plague, usually shortened to The Rev, was an American musician, best known as a co-founder and drummer of the American hard rock band Avenged Sevenfold. 

Sullivan was also the lead vocalist and pianist in the side-project Pinkly Smooth along with Synyster Gates.

He was born in Huntington Beach, California and started playing the drums when he was 10 years old. Before he joined Avenged Sevenfold, he was a member of the third wave ska band Suburban Legends. The last album that Sullivan was featured on was "Nightmare" which was released on July 27, 2010.

On the morning of December 28, 2009, Sullivan was found dead in his Huntington Beach home. Toxicology results later revealed that his death was from an overdose of Oxycodone, oxymorphone, diazepam, nordiazepam and alcohol. The coroner also said that an enlarged heart may have played a role in his death.
