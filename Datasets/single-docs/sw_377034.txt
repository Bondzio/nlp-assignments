List of Korean War Medal of Honor recipients

The Korean War was an increase of border clashes between two rival Korean governments (each of which was supported by external powers). Each Korean government was trying to topple the other through political and guerilla tactics. Some may refer to it as a civil war. Though many other factors were at play. South Korea filed to strengthen their cause in free elections held in May 1950. The refusal of South Korea to hold new elections per North Korean demands was also a factor. The communist North Korean Army moved south on June 25, 1950. It was an attempt to reunite the Korean peninsula which had been formally divided since 1948. The conflict was then expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950 until the armistice was signed on July 27, 1953.

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient is killed (posthumously).

During this war 135 Medals of Honor were presented for bravery in action. Ninety seven were presented posthumously.
