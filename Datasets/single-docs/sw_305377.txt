Curtin University

Curtin University is the largest university in Australia. Its main campus is in Bentley, Western Australia.

Curtin University was first called the Western Australian Institute of Technology (WAIT), which opened in 1966. But the name was changed to the Curtin University of Technology. In 2010, 'of Technology' was dropped and it is now known just as Curtin University.

In 2005, both Curtin and Murdoch University considered merging together, but this was later cancelled.

Curtin is split into four "faculties", the Centre for Aboriginal studies, Curtin Business school, Humanities, and Science and Engineering.

Curtin has its own bus port, which has many routes run through it, including services from Canning Bridge railway station.
