Como Ama una Mujer

Como Ama una Mujer () is the first full-length Spanish-language studio album, and fifth studio album overall released by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. The album was mainly produced by Colombian composers Julio Reyes and Estéfano.

In 2004 Lopez worked on a song with her husband Marc Anthony called "Escapémonos". She enjoyed working on the song so much that she decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years.
