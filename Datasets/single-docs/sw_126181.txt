SWAT team

A SWAT team is a group of highly trained police officers who deal with very dangerous criminals. SWAT is an acronym that means Special Weapons And Tactics. SWAT officers carry weapons of higher caliber than most police officers do, such as machine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Usually, police departments use SWAT teams to catch people who sell illegal drugs or try to hold people hostage. They also respond to serious crimes like bank robberies when normal police officers can not control the robbers.

The SWAT teams are usually called to deal with hostage situations. They plan the entry into the building where the hostages are being held carefully. They look closely at all building entrances to choose the best option. They make use of equipment such as rappelling ropes, nightvision goggles, thermalvision goggles, a tactical shield, flashbang and smoke grenades, snake cameras (small cameras that fit under doors and into very small holes), among others.

SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) officers are members of highly trained paramilitary units that tackle situations beyond the capability of conventional police forces. SWAT teams are called in when an incident presents significant risk to law enforcement officers or the public.SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) officers are members of highly trained paramilitary units that tackle situations beyond the capability of conventional police forces. SWAT teams are called in when an incident presents significant risk to law enforcement officers or the public. These elite professionals use their advanced training in weapons, teamwork and strategy to resolve crises such as:
•Counterterrorism operations
•Apprehension of armed and barricaded suspects
•Suicide intervention
•Warrant service under fire
•Protection of visiting dignitaries
•High-risk search and seizure
•Covert and undercover operations
•Crowd and riot control
•Fugitive tracking in rural environments

While all SWAT officers are expert marksmen with in-depth training in close combat, most play a specialized role within the team. Some serve as negotiators or medics while others are experts in handling assault vehicles or weapons. Each team includes several tactical officers who coordinate and carry out assaults on barricaded positions and apprehend armed suspects.

When not responding to crises, SWAT officers perform more routine duties. Many spend a majority of their time in conventional policing activities such as patrol and traffic enforcement. In some areas, they use their specialized tactical knowledge to conduct crime suppression exercises that ferret out dangerous offenders. 

Most SWAT officers consider serving on the team an honor and privilege. Members are chosen from the ranks of experienced police officers based on their superior fitness, marksmanship and service record. They take great pride in protecting the public and their fellow law enforcement officers in life-and-death situations that put their years of training and experience to the test.
