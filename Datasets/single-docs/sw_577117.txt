Edward Balliol

Edward Balliol was a claimant to the throne of Scotland. He was born in 1283 and died in 1367. He reigned from 1332-1336 but claimed the throne from 1314-1356.
He was the eldest son of John Balliol and thus the heir to the Scottish throne after John Balliol but John was deposed by Robert I and William Wallace (as guardian of Scotland).

He was chosen as king after the death of Margaret, maid of Norway. Although he was never considered to be the true king as he was an ally with Edward Longshanks and Edward II, kings of England.
