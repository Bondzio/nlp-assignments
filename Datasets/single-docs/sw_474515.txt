Division of Grey

The Division of Grey is an Australian electoral division in South Australia. It was set up in 1903 and is named for Sir George Grey, Governor of South Australia from 1841â€“45 (and later Prime Minister of New Zealand). 

The division covers 92% of the state. The borders of the electorate include the Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales borders, as well as the south coast. The division includes Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Roxby Downs, Coober Pedy, Port Pirie, Kadina, Maitland, Orroroo, Peterborough, Burra and Eudunda.

Jack Mortimer won the division in a by-election in 1963, caused by the death of Edgar Russell.
