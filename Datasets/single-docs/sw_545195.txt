The Treveri, a Gallic or Celtic tribe, inhabited the region for several hundred years until they were conquered by Julius Caesar in 54 BC. A Celtic necropolis from the 1st century was discovered in the early 1970s on the "Juckelsboesch" plateau between Mamer and Kehlen.
During the Gallo-Roman era which lasted until about 450, the Romans built and maintained a number of roads in the area including the "Kiem" (Latin "caminus", road) linking Trier to Reims through what is now Mamer. "Mambra" was a small Roman settlement on the banks of the Mamer river at the eastern end of today's Mamer. The Roman settlement was burnt by Germanic invaders around 276.

The road linking Luxembourg City to Brussels, passing through Mamer, was built in 1790. In 1859, the railway to Brussels was opened, with a station in Mamer.
