Photo editing

Photo editing is the changing of images. These images can be digital photographs, illustrations, prints, or photographs on film). Some types of editing, such as airbrushing, are done by hand and others are done using photo editing programs like Photoshop, Gimp and Microsoft Paint. Photo editing is done for many reasons. Many photos of models are edited to remove blemishes and make the model better. This is usually called "retouching", "airbrushing" or "Photoshopping", even if Photoshop or airbrushes are not used. Other reasons to edit a photo include fixing errors (red eye, contrast, brightness, etc.), practical jokes, and to trick people. Photo editing is also used to make completely new images. Photo editing is sometimes called photo manipulation, usually when it is used to trick people.

The first known example of photo editing happened in the 1860s to a photo of President Abraham Lincoln. Before the invention of computers, people had to edit images by hand. Some editing was done by pasting photos together. People also used tools like ink, paint and airbrushes. Enlargers made bigger pictures, and allowed adjustments such as brightening or darkening different parts. 

In the 1980s, photo editing computer programs for personal computers were made. The first version of Adobe Photoshop was released in 1987. Since then, it has become one of the most popular photo editing programs. It is so popular that many people now use the word "photoshop" to mean photo editing in general.

In 2011 the first photo editing mobile apps were released on App Store. First was Fotolr Photo Editor. Other apps have been made for other mobile operating systems. These apps allow easy editing and photo sharing by smartphone and tablet computer. 

Nowadays, online free photo editing Web applications prevail, such as Flickr, Vectr, and FotoJet. 

Professional photo editing is still dominated by Adobe Photoshop.
