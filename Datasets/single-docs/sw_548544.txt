Graeae

The Graeae, alternatively known as the Grey Sisters, are characters from Greek myth. They are a trio of hags, called Deino, Enyo and Pemphredo, and are so named because they were born with grey skin and hair. They also share one tooth and eye between them and they took it in turns to use them. They are affiliated with the gorgons and the hero Perseus forced them to reveal the whereabouts of Medusa by taking their eye and ransoming it for information.
