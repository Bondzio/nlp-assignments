Night of the Hurricane

Night of the Hurricane is a three-part crossover event in the "Animation Domination" block on Fox. It included the three animated series by Seth MacFarlane. These series were "Family Guy", "American Dad" and "The Cleveland Show". It was first to be broadcast on May 1, 2011, but a series of tornados that killed many people in the Southern United States made Fox broadcast it later. It was broadcast in the next season.
