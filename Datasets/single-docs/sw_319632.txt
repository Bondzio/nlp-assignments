Line of succession to the Norwegian throne

The line of succession to the Norwegian throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of Norway.

Since 1990, Norwegian law identifies the eldest child of a Norwegian monarch the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.

In 2011, the current order of succession is clear.
