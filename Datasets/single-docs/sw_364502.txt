Fundamental rights in the German Constitution

Fundamental rights in the German Constitution () are a set of rights guaranteed to the German people through their Basic Law (). The majority of the fundamental rights are contained in the Articles 1 to 19 of the "Grundgesetz" (GG). These rights are binding each of the country's constitutional institutions. In case the "Grundrechte" are violated and a remedy is denied by other courts, the Basic Law provides for an appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ().
