Great Green Wall

The Great Green Wall of Africa is a strip of trees going across Africa to stop the Sahara from moving south affecting lives up to 19 million people, including more than 1 million children. The strip of trees is planned to be about 15kms wide. Unfortunately some people, when they see these trees, think its an opportunity to gather wood as timber for them to make fire or other resources. Because of the Sahara desert moving south is affecting countries such as: Niger, Chad, Sudan, Mali and many more.
