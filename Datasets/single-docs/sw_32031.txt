Star Trek: Deep Space Nine

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9) is the third "Star Trek" television series. Most of the series takes place on a space station called "Deep Space Nine". It was the first and so far only "Star Trek" show to be based on a space station rather than a starship.

On the space station Deep Space Nine, the crew gets sick with an aphasia virus, which makes them say random words in place of what they mean to say.
