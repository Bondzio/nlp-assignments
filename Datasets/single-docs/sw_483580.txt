Stock (food)

Stock in cooking (cuisine) is a liquid flavoring base for soups and sauces. A flavoured liquid preparation, it forms the basis of many dishes. A stock is made by simmering animal bones and/or meat, fish, or vegetables in water and/or wine, adding mirepoix or other aromatics for more flavour. A newer approach is to use a pressure cooker. The ingredients may include meat, bones, herbs and spices, and mirepoix. Mirepoix is a mixture of onions, carrots, celery, and sometimes other vegetables.

Many use ready-made ingredients like Oxo cubes or bouillon cubes. Stock lasts for three or four days in the fridge, but can be boiled again, and stored again.

The ideas go back to CarÃªme, and were simplified by Escoffier.
