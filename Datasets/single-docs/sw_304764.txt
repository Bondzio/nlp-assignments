Qatar at the Olympics

Qatar at the Olympics is a history which includes 8 games in 7 countries and 100+ athletes. Since 1979, Oman has contributed to the growth of the "Olympic Movement".

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Qatar is QAT.

The Qatar Olympic Committee was formed in 1979 and recognized by the IOC in 1980.

Teams from Qatar have taken part in the Summer Olympic Games but not the Winter Olympic Games.

After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Qatar was, along with Saudi Arabia and Brunei, one of only three countries to never send a female athlete to the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee in 2010 said it would "press" these countries to have women's participate. Then the Qatar Olympic Committee said it "hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and fencing" to the 2012 Summer Games in London.
