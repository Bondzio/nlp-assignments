Audio description

Audio description is an additional track of narration. It is targeted at visually impaired or blind consumers of television, dance, opera, movies or other visual art. In these tracks, a narrator talks through presentation and makes a description about what's happening during natural pauses in audio. Descriptive video service (DVS) is used for the DVDs of certain movies as part of the audio description.
