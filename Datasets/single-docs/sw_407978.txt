In April 2013 it was shown that Sahai committed plagiarism in her habilitation thesis. She had submitted this thesis to the University of Heidelberg in 1986. She was also accused of presenting herself as being or having been a professor at that University. She never actually had such a position. The University of Heidelberg confirmed on 14 April, 2013, that plagiarism had taken place. The university also said that Sahai has no right to call herself a professor of the University of Heidelberg. Her habilitation has been revoked.
