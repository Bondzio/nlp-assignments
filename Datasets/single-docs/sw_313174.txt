RMS Lusitania

The RMS "Lusitania" was a British cruise-liner. The ship is best known for being sunk by Germany. 

Many believe the Lusitania was carrying ammunition to British troops when it was torpedoed by a German U-Boat early during World War I. 

There were 128 Americans on board. They were killed when the ship sank. At first President Woodrow Wilson only asked the German government to apologize and compensate the families of the victims. 

Two years later, this and other events led to the United States joining World War I on the Allied side.
