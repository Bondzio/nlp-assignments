Paul Bocuse

Paul Bocuse () (born 11 February 1926) is a French chef. He was raised in Lyon. He is famous for the high quality of his restaurants and his innovative approaches to cuisine. 

Bocuse is one of the most prominent chefs associated with the "nouvelle cuisine", which is less opulent and calorific than the traditional "cuisine classique", and stresses the importance of fresh ingredients of the highest quality. Paul Bocuse claimed that Henri Gault first used the term, "nouvelle cuisine", to describe food prepared by Bocuse and other top chefs for the maiden flight of the Concorde airliner in 1969.
