Goth subculture

A goth is a person who listens to gothic music. Goths often wear black clothes and unusual jewelry. Both goth men and goth women often wear make-up.

The "goth subculture" originated in the early 1980s among fans of the first gothic rock group, Bauhaus.

The word Goth comes from the word "Gothic" which actually means "gloomy" or "dark". This meaning of the word comes from "gothic fiction", a type of literature popular during the late 18th and early 19th century. 

People who call themselves a Goth are those who live up the meaning of the name through wearing clothes or putting on makeup that is in colours that represent death, decay, or gloominess, such as the colour black, deathly white face makeup, dark bloody red colours, or the tones of the colour puce.

Goth people also make and listen to "Goth music".

Goths wear normal black clothes and mix them with other colours to make a new look

Goth people are often mistaken to be emo or punk because of the everyday stereotypes.
