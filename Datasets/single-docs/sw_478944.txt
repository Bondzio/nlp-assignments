UY Scuti

UY Scuti is a bright red supergiant or hypergiant star. It is a pulsating variable star in the constellation Scutum. It is possibly the largest known star. It is also one of the most luminous and well-known of its kind. 

The star has an estimated average median radius of 1,708 times that of the Sun, or a diameter of 2.4 billion km (1.5 billion mi; 15.9 AU); thus a volume 5 billion times that of the Sun. 

It is about 2.9 kiloparsecs (9,500 light years) from Earth, so it is one of the nearest known hypergiants. If placed at the center of the Solar system, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Jupiter. The radius is not known for certain, and may be larger than the orbit of Saturn.
