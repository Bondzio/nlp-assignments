United States presidential election, 1992

The United States presidential election of 1992 was on November 3, 1992 in the United States. The three main people running were: George H. W. Bush, a Republican from Texas and the President; Bill Clinton, who was a Democrat and Governor of Arkansas; and Ross Perot an Independent candidate. 

Bill Clinton was the winner of the election. Clinton got 370 Electoral votes, Bush got 168, and Perot got 0. A person running for president will need to get 270 to win.

George H.W. Bush could have lost the election for several reasons. He broke his promise of "Read my lips: no new taxes" by increasing taxes during his term. Some of his most well-known accomplishments during his presidency came from his foreign policy, and because of the Cold War and Gulf War being over, foreign policy became a smaller issue, as the economy became a bigger issues, since the economy was bad.
