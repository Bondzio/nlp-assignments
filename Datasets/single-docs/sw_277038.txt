Teddy Bears' Picnic

"Teddy Bears' Picnic" is a very popular song about teddy bears. The tune was composed by John Walter Bratton in 1907. The words were added by Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy in 1932. Since then it has always been extremely popular as a children's song. Many musicians have made recordings of it. A particularly famous recording was made in 1932 by Henry Hall. For more than 30 years this recording was used by BBC audio engineers to test audio equipment.
