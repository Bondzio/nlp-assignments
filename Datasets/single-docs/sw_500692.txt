Fennoscandia

Fennoscandia or Fenno-Scandinavia is the region including the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. The term usually covers the countries Finland, Norway, and Sweden in their entireties. It also includes a part of Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words Fennia (which means Finland) and Scandia (which means Scandinavia).

Fennoscandia is different to both Scandinavia and the Nordic countries. Denmark is not in the Scandinavian Peninsula and Karelia and the Kola Peninsula are not a part of the Nordic countries. They are a part of Russia. The geography of Fennoscandia is very mountainous and rough. It is also very beautiful with sights such as fjords, which take up a lot of space in Norway. Socially Fennoscandia shows the historically close relationship between the Finnish, Norwegian, Russian, Sami and Swedish people.
