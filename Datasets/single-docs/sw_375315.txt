Fundamental force

The four fundamental forces are the ways that all things in nature affect each other. These forces are called gravity, electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force.

It is thought by most physicists that three of these forces (electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force) become a single force under very high temperatures. This idea is known as the grand unification theory.

Gravity is the force that pulls all common objects to each other.
