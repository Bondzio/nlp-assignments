Hydrosphere

The hydrosphere is the total mass of water on, under, and over the surface of a planet. It is part of physical geography.

The total mass of the Earth’s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 10 grams, which is about 0.023% of the Earth’s total mass. Around 2 × 10 grams of this is the Earth’s atmosphere. In addition, 71% of the Earth’s surface, an area of 361 million square kilometers, is covered by ocean.
