List of London railway stations

This list, by their present names, of heavy rail passenger stations in the Greater London region excludes stations served only by the London Underground, Tramlink and Docklands Light Railway systems.

Other station lists for the area (whose limits are a matter of debate, see this article's Talk) are:
For simplicity only major place names and lines are given, to help locate the stations. A line listed may neither serve passengers nor access platforms. Two lines are given for a station only if they do not connect and are not essentially collinear. Each station's linked article gives more detailed information, including services.

Repeated links (overlinkage) in this, a list, allows finding linked articles and expanding abbreviations without scrolling searches.

For compactness some abbreviations (e.g. N, S, E, W, M(ain)) are used. Roll over or click to see the full name.

Official names by this site for Blackfriars, Waterloo East and eleven absolute termini (which means "route ends") (not Moorgate) all start with "London". The thirteen are prefixed with asterisks in the list. Programs such as Travel planners require the "London" inconsistently. Queenstown Road is labelled "Queenstown Road (Battersea)" on maps and timetables, though its name is unique within London.
