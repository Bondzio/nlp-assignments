Tlazolteotl

Tlazolteotl (or "Tla√ßolteotl") is an Aztec goddess. She is the goddess of purification, steam bath, midwives, sin and adulterers. In Nahuatl, the word "tlazolli" means vice and diseases. Thus, Tlazolteotl was a goddess of filth (sin), vice and sexual misdeeds. However, she was also a purification goddess. Her dual nature is seen in her epithets; "Tlaelquani" ('she who eats filth [sin]') and "Tlazolmiquiztli" ('the death caused by lust'), and Ixcuina or Ixcuinan ('she of two faces'). Her sisters include Tiacapan (the first born), Teicu (the younger sister), Tlaco (the middle sister) and Xocotzin (the youngest sister).

She is the mother of Centeotl and Yum-Kax, the Maya maize god.
