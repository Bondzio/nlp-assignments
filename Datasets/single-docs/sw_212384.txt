Hurricane Agnes

Hurricane Agnes was a Category 1 hurricane in the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. Agnes affected many states, but the worst was in Florida, Pennsylvania, and New York. The name "Agnes" was one of five Category 1 hurricanes to get its name retired. ("Cesar", "Klaus", "Noel", and "Stan" were the others). At the time Hurricane Agnes was the costliest hurricane in the United States and the Atlantic Ocean. Agnes killed 130 people and caused $3 billion (USD) in damage. In 2009, that would have cost $15.7 billion (USD). As Agnes moved over the United States it caused a tornado outbreak. About 28 tornadoes were seen.

Because of the high damage and high number of people killed, the name "Agnes" was retired. There was no name to be used instead of Agnes, because the list changed in 1979.
