The shovelnose frogs are medium sized frogs, reaching a length of . They are round-bodied, with short legs. Their head is small and narrow, with a hard, upturned nose. 

The shovelnose frogs are digging frogs. They live most of their life underground. The female will dig underground while it is in amplexus. It then will lay the eggs in an underground hole. The male will leave through the tunnel, and the female will stay with the eggs. Once enough rain has fallen, the female will dig, with her nose, towards a water source. The tadpoles will stay there until metamorphosis. The tadpoles may stay out of water for up to a few days. 

Unlike most digging frogs, the shovelnose frogs dig head first. Other frogs dig rear first. 

Some species are kept as pets.
