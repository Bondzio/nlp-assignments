Division of Lalor

The Division of Lalor is a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of Victoria. It is located in the outer western suburbs of Melbourne. It includes the suburbs of Werribee, Point Cook, Laverton, Rockbank and Melton.

The Division was drawn up on 11 May 1949, for the 1949 Federal election. It was named after Peter Lalor, the leader of the miners at the Eureka Stockade, and a former member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. 

Barry Jones was the Minister for Science under Bob Hawke and Labor National President. Jim Cairns, was the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister under Gough Whitlam. As Julia Gillard was Deputy Prime Minister prior to becoming Prime Minister, Lalor is the only federal electorate to have been held by two Deputy Prime Ministers.
