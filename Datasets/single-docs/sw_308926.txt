Tetrapodomorph

Tetrapodomorpha is a clade of vertebrates. It is a clade of the Sarcopterygii which includes tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest relatives. Tetrapodomorpha is part of Rhipidistia. 

Advanced transitional fossils between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, like "Tiktaalik", are informally called 'fishapods' by their discoverers. They are half-fish half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology.

Among the characters defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint).

Tetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include "Eusthenopteron", "Osteolepis", "Panderichthys", "Tiktaalik", "Ventastega" and "Kenichthys".

The fossils of the early Mississippian, "Pederpes" and "Whatcheeria" are regarded as early tetrapods whose relationships are not yet clear.
