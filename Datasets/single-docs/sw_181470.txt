Isambard Kingdom Brunel

Isambard Kingdom Brunel (9 April 1806 â€“ 15 September 1859) was an English engineer. He was born in Portsea, Portsmouth. He created the Great Western Railway. He built many steamships and several bridges and tunnels. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering.

During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering "firsts". He assisted the building of the first tunnel under a large river. He designed the SS "Great Britain", the first propeller-driven ocean-going iron ship, at the time (1843) the largest ship ever built. He was the first designer of the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The bridge had a complicated history. It was a long span at a great height over the River Severn. Brunel died before the bridge was completed, and before the first voyage of his ship the SS "Great Eastern".
