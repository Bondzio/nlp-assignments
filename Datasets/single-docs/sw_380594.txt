Bird feet

Bird feet are adapted to the life they lead, and the patterns are often use in avian classification. They are derived from the basic limb of ancestral tetrapods, the pentadactyl limb. Whereas humans (and other primates) have the original five fingers and five toes, birds all have only four toes. These four toes are arranged into four main patterns.


The scales of birds are made of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found on the toes and sometimes further up on the ankle. The scales and scutes of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals.
