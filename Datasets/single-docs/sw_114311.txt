Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations is an adventure game made by Capcom for the Nintendo DS handheld. It's about a lawyer who has to defend his clients for murder.

A flashback case where Mia Fey has to defend Phoenix Wright for the murder of his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. This is Mia Fey's second case, and the first time she and Phoenix meet.

Phoenix Wright, Maya Fey, and Pearl Fey go to an art gallery and have to defend a thief who apparently stole Maya Fey's sacred urn. A man named Godot is prosecuting him, and has a grudge against Phoenix.

Someone impersonates Phoenix and does a bad job defending someone to frame them for murder. Phoenix learns that it's Maggey Byrde, a client he defended, and tries to find the real killer.

Mia Fey's very first case; she defends an escaped convicted murderer for the murder of a police officer.

Phoenix goes with Maya and Pearl to a shrine so that the two girls can train. They meet a famous writer, who is murdered the night they arrive. After this, the bridge to where Maya is training is set on fire by a bolt of lightning, and Phoenix tries to get across to save her, but falls into the raging water far below, so Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor and friend of Phoenix, has to come and act as a defense attorney for him.
