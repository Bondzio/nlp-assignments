National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award

The National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA) is a competition, exhibition and award held each year for visual arts in Australia. It is one of the most important art awards in Australia. It was first created in 1984 by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Telstra has sponsored the event since 1992, so it is often known as the Telstra Award.

The competition is open to all adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists. It features artists from all over Australia. Its goal is to show the best indigenous art in the country. The works can be in any media, including paintings (on bark, canvas and paper), prints, sculpture, textiles, weaving, ceramics, glass, photography, digital media and video.

The first prize of AU$40,000 is awarded to the work considered the best in the show. Smaller prizes of AU$4,000 each are awarded in four categories.
