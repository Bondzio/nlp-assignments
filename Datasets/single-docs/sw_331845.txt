Nagano Prefecture

Nagano Prefecture was created from the area of the former Shinano Province. 

Nagano was host to the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Nagano Prefecture is south of Niigata Prefecture. The eastern borders of Nagano meet Gunma Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture, Yamanashi Prefecture and Shizuoka Prefecture. Nagano's souther border is shared with Aichi Prefecture. The western borders of the prefecture are shared with Toyama Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture.

National Parks are established in about 21% of the total land area of the prefecture.
