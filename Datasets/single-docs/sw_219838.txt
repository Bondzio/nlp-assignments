Rubeus Hagrid

Rubeus Hagrid is a teacher and groundskeeper at Hogwarts, friend of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. He is also a "half-giant." His father was not a giant, whereas his mother, Fridwulfa, who died whilst he was young, was a giantess. He has a half-brother named Grawp. In the movies, Hagrid is played by Robbie Coltrane. Martin Playfield appears as a young Hagrid in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets".

Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts after The Ministry of Magic thought he had opened the Chamber of Secrets, but he had been framed by Tom Riddle and so was allowed to remain at the school as gamekeeper. The government broke his wand and banned him from doing magic when he was expelled, but he keeps pieces of the wand in his pink umbrella. 

Hagrid is also friends with Madame Maxime, it is not known if they were together in a romantic way.

Hagrid keeps several pets.
