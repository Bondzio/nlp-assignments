Artemis Fowl (novel)

Artemis Fowl is a book written by Eoin Colfer. It is the first book in the "Artemis Fowl" series. One of the main characters is Artemis Fowl II, trying to get gold from a group of fairies.

Some of the main characters are:



Artemis kidnaps Holly to try and get gold from the fairies. He succeeds because she does not have any magic as she has used it all. The fairies then put a time stop on Artemis' manor, to control the time for eight hours so they can get Holly back. As the negotiations fail, the fairies attack, but Artemis and Butler beat the fairies. The fairies send in Mulch, who discovers the reason Artemis knows about the fairies. They then send in a troll, which very nearly kills Butler and severely injures Holly. Luckily, Holly has got her magic back, so she can heal them both. After the troll episode, the fairies finally decide to give Artemis the gold, planning to kill him later so they can take the gold back. Artemis however escapes the time stop. At the end of the book, Artemis has given half the gold back so Holly heals his mother Angeline, who was sick.

The book received a good review by reviewers. A movie was supposed to be filmed in 2007, but there is still no sign of the movie.
