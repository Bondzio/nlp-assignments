The Jed Foundation

The Jed Foundation is a non-profit organization working to reduce the rate of suicide and emotional distress among college students. It is the largest such effort in the United States. It works with the government program, Suicide Prevention Resource Center, to develop and spread suicide prevention strategies. 

The Jed Foundation was founded in 2000 by Donna and Phil Satow. Their son Jed, a second year student at the University of Arizona, ended his life after struggling with college life. The organization works with the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, set up in 2002 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
