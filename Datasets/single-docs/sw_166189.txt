Battle of France

In World War II, the Battle of France, also called the Fall of France, was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, from 10 May 1940, and ended the Phoney War. The battle was made up of two parts. In the first, called "Fall Gelb" in German (called "Case Yellow" in English), German tank units pushed through the Ardennes, to circle the Allied units that moved into Belgium. Most of the British Expeditionary Force and many French soldiers escaped to England from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo. 

In the second part of the battle, called "Fall Rot" in German ("Case Red" in English), from 5 June, German armed forces circled the Maginot Line to attack the rest of France. Italy started its own invasion of southeastern France on 10 June. The French government left Paris for Bordeaux, and the Germans took Paris on 14 June. After the French Second Army Group surrendered on 22 June, France gave up as a country on 25 June. For the Axis, the Battle of France was a big win.

France was split into a German-occupied part in the north and west, a small Italian-occupied part in the southeast, and a satellite state part in the south, called Vichy France. Southern France was taken over on 10 November 1942 and France was run by Germany until after the Allied return in 1944; the Low Countries were set free in 1944 and 1945.
