Non-conformism

Non-conformism is a movement within English Protestantism which originated with the Puritans, later called Dissenters. These Christians refused to conform or submit to the rules of the Anglican church for doctrinal reasons, and so formed their own denominations, some Baptist, some Presbyterian.
