Pub rock (UK)

Pub rock is a rock music genre that developed in the mid-1970s in the United Kingdom.

Pub rock was a reaction against progressive and glam rock. Pub rock was short-lived, but it helped return live rock to small pubs and clubs. Its basic style of playing inspired the British punk rock scene.
