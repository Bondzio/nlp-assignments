Hinche

Hinche (Kréyòl: "Ench") is a city in the centre of Haiti. It is the capital city of the Centre "Département".

The city is in the region called "Plateau Central" about northeast of Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has four "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Hinche, Cerca-Cavajal (Kreyòl: "Sèka Kavajal"), Maïssade (Kreyòl: "Mayisad") and Thomonde (Kreyòl: "Tomonn").

Hinche is on the southern limit of the Plateau Central, a long valley between the "Massif du Nord", to the north, and the "Montagne Noire", to the south.

The city is on the right side of the River Guayamouc, a tributary of the River Artibonite.

The city was founded in 1704 with families that came from the Canary Islands; it took the Taíno name of the region: "Hincha". The French people changed the name to Hinche but in Spanish it is still Hincha. At that moment, the region was part of the Spanish colony of "Santo Domingo" (now the Dominican Republic).

After the Haitian Revolution, in the early 19th century, this region became part of the new Republic of Haiti but the Dominican Republic accepted the transfer of the region to Haiti only in 1929.

"Bassin Zim", to the east of Hinche, is a beautiful 20 m waterfall, a 30-minute drive from town.

In the city you will also find the "Cathédrale de Sacré-Coeur" ("Sacred Heart Cathedral").
