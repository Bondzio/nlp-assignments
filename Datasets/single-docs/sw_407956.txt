Epistolary novel

An epistolary novel is a novel written as a series of letters or other documents. The word "epistolary" comes from the Latin form of the Greek word ("epistolÄ“"), meaning a letter (see epistle). The epistolary form of writing can make the story seem more realistic to the reader. This is because it is more personal, and is more like the workings of real life.
