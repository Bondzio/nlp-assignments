Kiribati at the Olympics

The island nation of Kiribati was first in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. Weightlifter Meamea Thomas and sprinters Kakianako Nariki and Kaitinano Mwemweata represented the country.

The country's name was notably mispronounced by officials in all three languages -French, English and Greek- during the opening ceremony in 2004.
