Artemision Zeus

The Artemision Zeus is a Greek bronze statue. It dates to the Early Classical period, ca. 460 BC. It stands 2.09 m in height. It was found in the debris of a shipwreck near Cape Artemision in 1926-1928. It is in the National Museum, Athens. There has been some debate whether the statue represents Zeus or Poseidon. Caroline Houser believes it is unlikely the statue is Poseidon because his trident would obscure the statue's face.
