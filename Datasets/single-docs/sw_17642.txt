Cinnamon

Cinnamon is a spice got from the inner bark of "Cinnamomum verum". 

The spice is used in both sweet and savoury foods. It is very aromatic. People usually put cinnamon in sweet baked goods (such as cinnamon rolls), hot wine or liquors. 

Cinnamon was used to make the spiced wine, claret, in the Middle Ages. In India, cinnamon is commonly used in making flavoured tea. It is either directly added as small pieces or put in powdered form during the preparation of tea. It is known as "Daal-Cheeni" in Hindi.

The Sinhalese name is "kurundu". Cinnamon is grown as an export crop in Sri Lanka.

There is a literature which suggests that cinnamon spice may have positive effects on diabetes type II. This is not the view of the U.S, National Institutes of Health.
