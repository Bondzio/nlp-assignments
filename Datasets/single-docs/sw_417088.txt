Ribonuclease

Ribonuclease (commonly abbreviated RNase) is a type of enzyme that chops RNA into smaller parts. There are many different versions of the enzyme.

All organisms studied contain many RNases of many different sorts. This shows that RNA degradation is a very ancient and important process.
