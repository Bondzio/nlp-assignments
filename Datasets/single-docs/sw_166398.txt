Pirna

Pirna is a "Große Kreisstadt" in the rural district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

Pirna is located at the beginn of the Elbtalkessel, where the Wesenitz and the Gottleuba flow in the Elbe. In the south of Pirna is the "Osterzgebirge". Pirna is named "Tor zur Sächsischen Schweiz" (door to the Sächsische Schweiz).

Direct in the north of Pirna is the capital of Saxony, Dresden. Nearby towns are Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel, Bahretal, Dohma, Dohna, Dürrröhrsdorf-Dittersbach, Heidenau, Lohmen, Stadt Wehlen and Struppen. All these towns are in the rural districts of Sächsische and Schweiz-Osterzgebirge.

The first relics of human settlers are from the last ice age. In the neolithic age farmers lived in this region. In the 6th century the Sorbs settled in Pirna.

With the foundation of the "Mark Meißen" in the 10th century it was possible to re-prove a settlement in the area of Pirna. In the 12th century the castle of Prina would be built. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen gave the townrights to Pirna. The Elbe was in this time an important river for the trade. In 1233 the town was first mentioned in a document. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia bought the town in 1293 and so the town was Bohemian until 1405. In 1307 a convent was founded.
