Dave Ulliott

David A. Ulliott (4 April 1954 â€“ 6 April 2015), known by the nickname Devilfish, was an English professional gambler and poker player. Ulliott was a minor figure in the Hull underworld, but went on to become a World Series of Poker bracelet-winner, and a mainstay of televised poker. 

At the poker table, he is known for wearing orange sunglasses, a sharp suit (or leather jacket) and gold knuckleduster rings reading "Devil" and "Fish", which he made himself.

He lived in Kingston upon Hull, not far from where he grew up. Ulliott died on 6 April 2015 from colon cancer.
