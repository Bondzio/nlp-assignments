Assassination of Theo van Gogh

Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was assassinated by Mohammed Bouyeri in Amsterdam East, Netherlands. He was murdered in broad daylight. Van Gogh's last words, according to eyewitnesses, were "Mercy mercy! We can talk about this!"

The murderer Mohammed Bouyeri killed van Gogh. The reason for murdering Gogh was to oppose the controversial film Submission. Bouyeri shot and stabbed van Gogh, then cut his throat. Finally the killer attached a 5 letter page to van Gogh's chest with a knife. Bouyeri was chased by Dutch police after shooting a bullet into Bouyeri's leg. Bouyeri was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Bouyeri stated, he doesn't have any regret for killing van Gogh. He termed the assassination as Jihad.

Van Gogh was buried in Amsterdam on 9 November, 2004. Van Gogh's son claimed that many assassination attempts were made but van Gogh refused to take police protection.

Sooner after van Gogh's assassination, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Geert Wilders went into hiding. This is because Bouyeri made death threats against Hirsi as the writer of the film.

On 18 March 2007, a sculpture honoring van Gogh, entitled "De Schreeuw" ("The Scream"), was unveiled in Amsterdam. It is located in the Oosterpark, a short distance from where van Gogh was murdered.
