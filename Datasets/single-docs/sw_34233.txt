Idi Amin

Idi Amin Dada (17 August 1925 â€“ 16 August 2003) was a repressive dictator of the African country of Uganda. The President of Tanzania at the time, Julius Nyerere, invaded Uganda to save the country from Idi Amin.

Amin is famous for sending all Asians, mainly from India and Pakistan, out of Uganda. He threw them out because he believed they were taking the jobs of Ugandans. Many of the Asians that left Uganda came back after Amin was thrown out.

Amin was a convert to Islam. He supported the cause of Palestine freedom. This caused the hijacking of an Air France flight that landed in Uganda. 

He died in 2003 in Saudi Arabia from kidney failure, aged 77. He lived in Saudi Arabia after being thrown out of Uganda, he was barred from ever returning since he left. He died one day before his 78th birthday.

He was put on life support on July 18 but when his organs began to fail, life support mechanism was disconnected by family. He was buried without any memorial in a simple grave without headstone.

A 2006 movie, "The Last King of Scotland" is about Amin's government. Forest Whitaker won an Academy Award for best actor.
