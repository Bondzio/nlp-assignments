Back in Black

Back in Black is a 1980 album by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It was the first album made without former band member Bon Scott. Back in Black was intended as a tribute to his death. One song from the album, "You shook me all night long", ranked number thirty-four on the Billboard charts. This was the first time a heavy metal song appeared in the Top 40. Even today, record producers rank 'Back in Black' as the standard for how a hard rock song should sound.
