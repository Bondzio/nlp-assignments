The Little Match Girl

"The Little Match Girl" is a story by Hans Christian Andersen. It was first published in December 1845. Andersen got the idea to write the story after seeing a print by Johan Thomas Lundbye of a little girl selling matches. The story has been adapted to various media including an animated movie.

A little match girl lights all the matches she carries to keep herself warm on a cold New Year's Eve. In the glow of the firelight, she sees wonderful visions of a Christmas tree and a festive dinner. The last vision is her dead grandmother, the only person to ever show her any love. The little match girl dies in the cold, and ascends into Heaven with her grandmother.
