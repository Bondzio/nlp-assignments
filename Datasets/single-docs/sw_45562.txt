Mango

A mango is a type of fruit. The mango tree is native to South Asia, from where it has been taken to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics.

Pakistan and India share the major export market of mangoes. It is also their "national fruit". 
Ripe mangoes are very sweet in taste but they are bitterly sour before they ripen. There are many different types of mangoes found in India such as Langra, Dussheri, Chausa, Tota, Safadi. Alphonso mangoes can be found in various parts of western India.

The tree is more known for its fruit rather than for its wood. However, mango trees can be converted to lumber once their fruit bearing lifespan has finished. The wood is susceptible to damage from fungi and insects. The wood is used for musical instruments such as Ukeleles, plywood and low-cost furniture. The wood is also known to produce phenolic substances that can cause dermatitis. It was the state tree of Junagadh State.
