Preposition

Prepositions are words which link nouns, pronouns and phrases to other words in a sentence.

Prepositions usually describe the position of something, the time when something happens and the way in which something is done, although the prepositions "of," "to," and "for" have some separate functions.

Prepositions can sometimes be used to end sentences. For example, "What did you put that there for?"

The table below shows some examples of how prepositions are used in sentences.
