Electronic commerce

Electronic commerce more well known as e-commerce, consists of the buying or selling of products via electronic means such as the internet or other electronic services. This type of trade has been growing rapidly because of the expansion of the Internet.

Over time many variants of EFTs within banks were introduced like debit cards, credit cards and direct deposits.
