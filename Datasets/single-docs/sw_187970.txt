Red Faction: Guerrilla

Red Faction: Guerrilla is a third-person shooter video game made by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ, with the PC version being made by Reactor Zero. The game first came out on June 2, 2009 in North America for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In the European countries it was released on June 5 2009 and the Microsoft Windows version will be released on August 25 2009. The game is the third game in the Red Faction series.

Red Faction: Guerrilla has a third person perspective, the first two games had a first-person perspective. This was changed because Volition though that the third-person view would be better because the player would be able to see more of the environment. In Red Faction: Guerrilla, the hero, Alec Mason, can run, jump, steal vehicles, and use weapons to explore the open world of Mars and fight the EDF (Earth Defense Force).

Red Faction: Guerrilla has gotten good reviews. The Metacritic score is 85/100. The GameSpot reviewer Randolph Ramsey gave the game a, 8.5/10. He said that the physics and the realism of the game were good, but also said that the game is repetitive and that the story was not good. IGN reviewer Charles Onyett gave the game an 8/10. He said that the game is fun, but that the storyline, graphics, and voice acting are weak.
