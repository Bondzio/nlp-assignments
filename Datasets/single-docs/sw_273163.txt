Bee Train

Bee Train Production Inc. (ビィートレイン株式会社, Biītorein Kabushikigaisha?) usually referred to as Bee Train is Japanese anime studio in Japan. The studio was started in 1997 by a director named Koichi Mashimo with a few of his colleagues in 1997. The studio is most famous for showing strong female characters with a light lesbian attraction.

1997 a Japanese anime director Koichi Mashimo had been working around Japan as director on his own (not employed to one single company) with a group of other artists. The goal of Mashimo was to start a studio that would encourage and help young artists. To do this, Mashimo went to a friend of his at another studio called Production I.G. The company president agreed to help Mashimo with his plan and helped start it. .

The first few years the two studios worked together on anime based on popular video games then Bee Train studio grew big enough to work more on its own. Later the studio was given a project of short videos to tie in with a new video game series called .hack (said as "dot hack"). In addition to the new set of videos the studio was also given a 26 episode television series. The next years would be met with new additions to the game series and the studio's famous "girls-with-guns" trilogy.

In 2006 Bee Train left its parent company Production I.G and became independent. The two studios still have a good relationship with each other and work together on projects occasionally.

2009-2010 the studio expanded to include two new areas called C-Station and D-Station. Bee Train also has another small office called Studio Road. Studio Road does the color work for anime.
