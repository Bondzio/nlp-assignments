Bilan d'aptitude délivré par les grandes écoles

The Bilan d'aptitude délivré par les grandes écoles (BADGE) is a French degree created in 2001 by the "Conférence des Grandes Écoles" and primarily intended for owners of a two-year degree after the end of secondary studies.

The BADGE program necessarily includes a number of common elements: at least 200 hours of instruction, including theoretical, practical work, team projects and possibly distance learning and a final validation test.
The program takes place over a period of 7 weeks to 24 months maximum, subject to alternating training / business where the period exceeds 6 months.
