The movie got mixed to positive reviews from critics. It has a 66% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert rated the movie three out of four stars and said that it "doesn't match the poetry and the mystery of the original film" and that it "has an ending that is infuriating, not only in its simplicity, but in its inadequacy to fulfill the sense of anticipation, the sense of wonder we felt at the end of 2001". He finished his review by "And yet the truth must be told: This is a good movie. Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that 2001 continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed 2010 of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera".

In 1985, the movie was nominated for five Academy Awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, and Best Sound Presentation.
