Stereotypic movement disorder

People with stereotypic movement disorder often hurt themselves. Some people make behaviors such as keeping their hands in their pockets, to prevent these movements. Cause of stereotypic movement disorder is certain physical conditions, head injuries and use of some drugs (cocaine). Childhood habits can result in negative social interactions and avoidance by peers and family members. Some repetitive behaviors can cause damage. The most common treatment approaches used for children with this condition are therapies aimed at reducing stress that may trigger the movements and changing behaviors. Some medications may also help reduce stereotypic behavior. Naltrexone has been used with some success in reducing stereotypic self-injurious behavior. In some cases, antidepressants such as Prozac, Zoloft and Luvox (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), or Anafranil (a tricyclic antidepressant) may be helpful.
