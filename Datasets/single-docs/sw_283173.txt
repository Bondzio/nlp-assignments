Hearing aid

A hearing aid is a small electrical machine which fits in or behind a person's ear. The purpose of a hearing aid is to make sounds louder so the person can hear spoken words and other sounds.

The two most common types of modern hearing aids are "behind the ear aids" and "in the ear aids".

Before hearing aids were invented, people used "ear trumpets" also called ear horns.

There are many different types of hearing aids as shown in the "different hearing aids," image on this page. Depending on your lifestyle as well as how much help you need to hear, you will use different hearing aids. An audiologist can help make hearing aids even better suited to you by customising them depending on what you need.
