Fox News Channel

Fox News Channel is an American conservative cable and satellite television news network. It was made by Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes. It is owned by Fox Broadcasting Company. 

The channel plays up to 15 hours of live shows every day. 9 hours are news programs based on fact. The remaining 6 hours are opinion shows. The hosts of its opinion shows are Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Neil Cavuto, Greta Van Susteren, and Geraldo Rivera. Fox News Network leans right-wing, but has some liberals, such as Greta van Susteren. 

There was a documentary called "Outfoxed" that criticized the channel because they say it is biased towards conservatives and the US Republican Party in its reporting. Fox says its opinion shows are biased but its regular news programs are not. President Obama through a spokesperson accused Fox News Network of working for the Republican Party. Roger Ailes has called Fox News "the balance" against the liberal networks news groups such as ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, Cable News Network, and MSNBC, and seems to now promote his network as a conservative network.
