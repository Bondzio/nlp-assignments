Šiprage

Šiprage (Шипраге) is a settlement in the Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska entity, Kotor Varoš Municipality.

Šiprage is on the Vrbanja river. In 1991, 956 people lived in Šiprage. The highest elevation is 520 m.

During the Bosnian War (1992–95), Bosnian Serb Police and Army forces destroyed villages upstream along the Vrbanja to Kruševo Brdo. One of the 18 camps for detained Bosniaks from the Kotor Varoš Municipality was at the Police station (MUP) in Šiprage.

After 1996, most of the Bosniak villages were partly restored thanks to the Luxembourgish government. During the war, an Orthodox church was built in the centre of the village.
