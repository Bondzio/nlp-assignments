Hernia

A hernia is a medical condition. If an organ or its tissue moves from its normal position through to another position, this is called a hernia. 

There are various types of hernia. Most hernias happen in the abdomen. Hernias sometimes give pain and/or a lump that can be felt or seen. The cause can be hereditary or it can be from lifting objects especially heavy ones â€“ in a wrong way. There are other things that can give hernias as well.
