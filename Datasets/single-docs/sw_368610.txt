Glires

Glires (from Latin "glīrēs", dormice) is a clade (sometimes ranked as grandorder) consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, and pikas). This hypothesis that these form a monophyletic group has been long debated based on morphological evidence, although recent morphological studies strongly support monophyly of Glires.
