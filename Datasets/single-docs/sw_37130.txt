Imtech Arena

The Imtech Arena is a concert and sports arena in Hamburg, Germany. It is owned and used by the Hamburger SV football team. Many Hamburg residents still refer to the arena as the Volksparkstadion (Peoples Park Stadium), though AOL bought the naming rights for 30 million marks or 15.3 million euros in 2001. From July 2007 until July 2010 the name was HSH Nordbank Arena. 

The stadium houses a museum which presents the history of the Hamburger SV club.

The HSV museum is open daily from 10 am to 8 pm.
