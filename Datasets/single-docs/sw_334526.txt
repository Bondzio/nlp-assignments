Anaïs Mitchell (; born March 26, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist.

Anaïs Mitchell is the daughter of a novelist and a college professor. She started writing and performing songs at the age of seventeen. As a child, she grew up on a farm in Addison County, Vermont. She also traveled to the Middle East, Europe and Latin America. She later studied at Middlebury College.

In 2002, Mitchell recorded her first album "The Song They Sang When Rome Fell".

In 2003 Mitchell won the "New Folk" award at the Kerrville Folk Festival.

Her album, "Hymns for the Exiled", was released on Chicago's Waterbug Records label in 2004. This recording caused her to be noticed by singer/songwriter, Ani DiFranco. DiFranco signed Mitchell to the Righteous Babe Records label.

In 2008 Mitchell was nominated in the "Contemporary Artist" category of the third annual Folk Alliance awards show broadcast. In September that same year Righteous Babe Records released "country e.p."

Mitchell released an album called "Young Man in America," on her Wilderland Records label in 2012.

Mitchell has gotten good reviews on her musical style and performance. An article in "Acoustic Guitar" magazine compares her to Dylan, Cohen, and Welch.

A review in "No Depression" magazine said that Mitchell is "girlishly sprite and brimming with innocence" and says that she "brings to mind the hippie-throwback charm of Victoria Williams and "80s pop star Cyndi Lauper".
