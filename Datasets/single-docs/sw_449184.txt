Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics

Basketball in the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at the Jamsil Gymnasium in Seoul, South Korea. The United States won the gold medal in the women's competition. This repeated their performance from the 1984 tournament. In the men's tournament, the Soviet Union took home their second gold medal in the team's history for this event. Yugoslavia won the silver medal. The USA won the bronze medal. This was the last Olympic basketball tournament where NBA players were not allowed to participate. Professionals from other leagues were allowed to compete. But players from other leagues were still considered amateurs. These were also the last Olympic basketball tournaments where the Soviets fielded a team. This was because the Soviet Union broke up prior to the 1992 Games. The United States was a major favorite to win.
