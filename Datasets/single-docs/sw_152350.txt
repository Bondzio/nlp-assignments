Halo (song)

"Halo" is a song by American R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles. It was written by Ryan Tedder, Evan Bogart and Knowles for her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce". In the United States, the song was released on January 20, 2009 as the album's fourth single. Even before its official release the song debuted on the "Billboard" Pop 100 at number 87.

It references her husband Jay-Z. It was a successful song worldwide, reaching the Top 10 in several countries.

Ryan Tedder wrote the song for Leona Lewis to sing. However, in an interview, Leona Lewis stated that she did not have the time to record the track for her album and felt that it better suited Beyoncé.
