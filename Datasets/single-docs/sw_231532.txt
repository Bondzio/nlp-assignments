BOINC

BOINC, or The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing, is an organization that lets ordinary people use their computers to do scientific work. SETI, or Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is the most popular of the BOINC programs. SETI searches for radio signals from outer space that might be a sign of alien life and worlds. BOINC involves other scientific work. For example, it allows individuals to use their computer to find the structures of proteins, a cure for the disease malaria or the very structure of our galaxy, the Milky Way.
