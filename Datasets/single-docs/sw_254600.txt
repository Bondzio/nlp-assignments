Hurricane Allen

Hurricane Allen was an extremely powerful hurricane in 1980. The storm smashed through the Caribbean, Mexico and South Texas in August 1980. Over 200 were killed and damages were $1 billion (1980 USD). The winds of this hurricane reached 190 miles an hour, tying Hurricane Camille for highest wind speeds in any Atlantic Tropical Cyclone. Allen was one of the most powerful Atlantic tropical storms in recorded history. The name Allen was later retired in Spring of 1981 and replaced with Andrew, which in turn was retired because of the destructive 1992 hurricane.
