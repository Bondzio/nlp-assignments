Babri Mosque

The Babri Mosque (, ), or Mosque of Babur was a mosque in Ayodhya, India. It was constructed by order of the first Mughal emperor of India, Babur, in Ayodhya in the 16th century. 

The mosque was built on top of a Hindu Temple, the Ram Janmabhoomi, birthplace of Lord Rama. Babri mosque was destroyed in 1992 when a Rally of Hindus entered to the Ayodhya. After the demolition of the Babri Mosque there was violence between Muslims and Hindus. On 27 September 2010 an Indian High Court (Allahabad High Court) decided that the Mosque was built on the Shri Ramlala Temple which was destroyed by Babar. Allahabad High Court decided to split the site into three parts.
