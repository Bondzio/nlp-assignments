Oxegen

Oxegen was an annual music festival held between 2004 and 2013. It was sponsored by Heineken and was Ireland's biggest festival. The event was promoted by MCD Productions. Oxegen was originally a two-day festival, but in 2008 was increased to four days. It took place at the Punchestown Racecourse in County Kildare, Ireland with an average attendance of around 80,000 people a day, with around 70,000 of these camping on site for the duration, and the rest travelling to the site each day. It took place on the same weekend as T in the Park in Scotland, and would sometimes share similar line-ups each year. Oxegen was also somtimes compared to England's Glastonbury Festival, with the Oxegen 2008 festival sharing three of the same headliners. The festival attracted attention from outside Ireland, with some visitors travelling from overseas.
