National Front of Balawaristan

The party was formed on December 28, 1989 under the Chairmanship of Nawaz Khan Naji. The first time reorganized in July 30 1993. In 1947 at the time of Independence of Pakistan the people of the area were predominantly Shia Muslims. However over the years the ethnic composition has been changed as sunni Kashmiri and other Pakistanis have settled in this area leading to discontent - although Shias remain the outright majority. A 2008 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determined that Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which included Gilgit-Baltistan, was 'Not Free'. In 2009 as part of "Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order Act of 2009", the region was granted self-rule for the first time with an elected legislature in its history, despite protests from the Republic of India it asserts that Gilgit-Baltistan is a part of the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu which they regard it as so-called an 'integral part' of India. which illegally regards the disputed region as Indian territory.
