Body image

Body image refers to the perceptions of a human's own physical appearance. It can also refer to the internal sense of having a body which is interpreted by the brain.

A 2007 report by the "American Psychological Association" found that a culture-wide sexualization of girls (and women) was contributing to increased female anxiety associated with body image. The study found that women are more worried about their body image than men, though the last pioneered the culture of bodybuilding.
