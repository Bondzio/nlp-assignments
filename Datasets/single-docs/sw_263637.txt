Hypomanganate

Hypomanganate is an ion. Its chemical formula is MnO. It is bright blue. It disproportionates into manganates and manganese(IV) oxide easily. This can be stopped by adding a lot of a base. They are both reducing agents and oxidizing agents. They are made by reducing manganates with sulfites and hydrogen peroxide.
