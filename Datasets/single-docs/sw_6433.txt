Nahuatl

The Nahuatl language is a language spoken by 1.5 million people in Mexico. A classical form of the language was spoken by the Aztecs, the Toltecs and perhaps by the people of Teotihuacan. Since the end of the Aztec empire, several dialects of Nahuatl started to exist. Nowadays people who speak different Nahuatl dialects do not always understand each other.

Some English words from Nahuatl origin are:

According to John Lipski, most "Mexicanisms" phrases that are unique to Mexican Spanish come from Nahuatl. One example is "Ã¡ndale "(often meaning "let's go"). Another is the word "Bueno?", which many Spanish speakers use when they answer the telephone.

Additionally, the names "Mexico," "Guatemala," and "Nicaragua" come from Nahuatl words.
