Graham Nash

Graham William Nash (born 2 February 1942 in Blackpool, England) is a English musician, singer and songwriter. He was a founding member of The Hollies, but left that band to form Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby and Stephen Stills. He moved to California to be part of the new group, which Neil Young also joined later.

While Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young broke apart and came back together many times, Nash has almost always worked with David Crosby since the 1960s.

Nash became an American citizen in 1978. Besides music, he is also a talented photographer, and collector of photographs.
