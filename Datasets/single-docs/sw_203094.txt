Iller-Lech Plateau

The Iller-Lech Plateau () or Upper Swabian Plateau ("Oberschwäbische Hochebene"), is one of the natural regions of Germany.

In the northwest: the Swabian Jura (D60 on the map); The river Danube is roughly the border between the two natural regions.

In the extreme northeast: the Franconian Jura (D61 on the map); The river Danube is roughly the border between the two natural regions.

In the east: the Lower Bavarian Uplands and the Isar-Inn Gravel Plateaus (D65 on the map); The river Lech is roughly the border between the two natural regions in parts.

In the south: the Southern Alpine Foreland (D66 on the map); The terminal moraines of the Würm glaciation are roughly the border between the two natural regions.
