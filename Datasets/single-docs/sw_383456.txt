Edwin Jarvis

Jarvis Hopson or Edwin Jarvis is the butler of Tony Stark. He had also appeared in the Spider-Man comics. He has also been a supporting character in The Avengers comics. He sometimes is mistaken with DC Comics butler Alfred Pennyworth because of their background and what they do. He took care of the Start Mansion and Tony after his parents death.

Jarvis is as J.A.R.V.I.S, a robot in "Iron Man", "Iron Man 2", "The Avengers", and in "Iron Man 3" because the directors did not want any confusion with Alfred Pennyworth. He is voice by Paul Bettany.
