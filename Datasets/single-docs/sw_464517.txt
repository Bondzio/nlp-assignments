Argument from morality

An argument from morality is an argument for the existence of God. Also called moral arguments, most are apologetic arguments. They argue there is a moral order in the universe and so there must be a God. German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an argument from morality based on reason. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue. Further, that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this.
