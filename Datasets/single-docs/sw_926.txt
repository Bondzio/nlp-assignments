Wiktionary

Wiktionary is a dictionary, or a group of meanings for words, in the form of a wiki. There are many languages of Wiktionary. Wiktionary is also a thesaurus. Wiktionary is run by the Wikimedia Foundation, which also runs Wikipedia. There is a , which is the sister project to the Simple English Wikipedia. The Simple English Wiktionary was created on November 2005. As of June 2016, it has over 24,000 articles (or entries), over 16,000 users and 4 administrators.

In 2006, there was a vote for the change of the logo of Wiktionary. The original logo of only words was replaced. However, there were very few people who voted in this contest. Therefore, smaller wikis used the newer logo but the English Wiktionary stayed the same logo.

In 2009, there was a second contest for a newer logo "(pictured)". This was a step to make all the Wiktionaries to have the same logo on all projects. However, the English Wiktionary still did not use the new logo. The Simple English Wiktionary voted on the new logo on November 30, 2010 and the community decided the new logo to become their logo. However, no changes were made to the logo and the discussion was thus forgotten.
