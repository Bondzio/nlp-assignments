Sam Koch

Samuel David Koch ("Koch" is pronounced "Cook") (born August 13, 1982 in York, Nebraska) is an American football punter for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). 

Koch was drafted out of the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln by the Baltimore Ravens with the 203rd pick in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Koch has had a good career, with an impressive 43.8 punting average. In a 2008 Week 16 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Koch has a critical fourth down run. In 2010, he passed to cornerback Cary Williams for a first down on another fake punt. Koch has also kicked occasionally in relief of Matt Stover. He won Super Bowl XLVII with the Ravens when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31. During the end of the game, Koch scrambled in his own end zone and took an intentional safety to leave 4 seconds on the clock, he then booted a 60-yard free kick which Ted Ginn, Jr. returned for 31 yards but was tackled in the midfield as the time ran out.
