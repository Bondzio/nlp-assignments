Citizenship in the United States

Citizenship in the United States means being a citizen of the United States. A person who has citizenship is called a citizen.

Citizenship does not just mean that a person lives in the United States. United States citizenship gives people many rights, many protections, and also some duties. 

Once a person is a United States citizen, their citizenship cannot be taken away unless they ask for it to be taken away.

There are two ways that people can become citizens of the United States.

The first is called "birthright citizenship." Anybody who is born in the United States automatically becomes a United States citizen.

The second is called "naturalization." This is for people who were born outside the United States. A person becomes a "naturalized citizen" if they apply for citizenship and are approved.

Once a person is a naturalized citizen, they have all of the same rights, protections, and duties as a person who was born in the United States.

Being a United States citizen gives a person many rights. Here is a list of some of these rights.


Citizenship also comes with duties. Here are some of those duties.
