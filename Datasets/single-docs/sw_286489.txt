Avian incubation

Incubation, sometimes called brooding, is the process by which birds hatch their eggs. It is usually done by sitting on the eggs to keep them warm.

In most species, body heat from the brooding parent keeps the eggs warm, but several groups, such as the Megapodes, instead use heat generated from rotting vegetables or use heat from the sun.
