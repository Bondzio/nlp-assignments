Fred Eckhardt

Fred Eckhardt (1926 – August 10, 2015) was an American brewer, homebrewing advocate and publicist. He wrote about brewed beverages—beer and sake, and wrote the 1989 book, "The Essentials of Beer Style". He called himself a "beer writer," a "beer historian," and a "beer critic." He was a local celebrity in Portland, Oregon, which Eckhardt described as "the brewing capital of the world."
