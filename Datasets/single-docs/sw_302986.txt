Artur Balder

Artur Balder (born August 14, 1974) is a Spanish-American filmmaker and writer.

Artur Balder is the author of several children books. His literature is published and internationally distributed by Random House in Spain and South America. His historical fiction sagas, published by Edhasa, are inspired by Germanic heroes like Arminius in the times of ancient Rome, or the Saxon duke Widukind, who leaded a rebellion during early Middle Ages against emperor Charlemagne. His books are translated into several languages. Among others: Dutch, Italian, French, Romanian.

In 2010 he wrote and directed the documentary about Little Spain. Balder lived at the building of the Spanish Benevolent Society for more than one year as resident artist. During this time, he discovered on 14th Street archives that could show for first time the evolution of the streets of Little Spain in Manhattan since its origins. The documentary reveals the untold history of the Spanish American presence in the New York City borough of Manhattan, and its community around 14th Street, known as Little Spain. The archive contains more than 450 photographs and 150 documents that have never been publicly displayed. They present the history of the streets of Little Spain in New York City throughout the 20th Century.

The movie is dedicated to Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and includes lines from his work Poet in New York.
