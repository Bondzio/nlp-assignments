Jaguar Cars

Jaguar Cars is a brand of cars made by Jaguar Land Rover. This is a British car builder, owned by the Indian builder Tata Motors since the beginning of 2008. It was established in 1922 by William Lyons. It was renamed Jaguar in 1935. Jaguar is owned by the Indian automobile manufacturer Tata Motors Ltd. Jaguar is known for its luxury saloons and sports cars.

Jaguar was a private company until it became part of the British Motor Corporation in 1966. The new company was called British Motor Holdings. In 1968 that company joined with Leyland Motors to became British Leyland. In 1975 British Leyland was nationalised. In 1984 Jaguar was made private again by Margaret Thatcher. Ford bought Jaguar in 1989. In 1999 it was made part of Ford's "Premier Automotive Group" along with Aston Martin, Land Rover, Volvo and Lincoln. In 2008, Ford sold Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors. Jaguar is now a brand of the merged company called Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).

The company was originally in Blackpool, but moved to Coventry. Today Jaguar cars are made at the JLR factory in Castle Bromwich in Birmingham.

Jaguar owns the Daimler brand (not Daimler-Benz). Jaguar bought the British Daimler Company in 1960. Daimler became a brand for some of Jaguar's saloon cars, but is not used now.

As of 2017, JLR sells four different Jaguar car ranges: XJ, XF, XK, F-Pace, and the F-Type.

Jaguar has won many sports car races, like the Le Mans 24 Hours.
