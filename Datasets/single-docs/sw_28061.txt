Kookaburra

Kookaburras are birds of the genus Dacelo and are native to Australia and New Guinea. An adult kookaburra is generally 28â€“42cm from the head to the tip of the tail.


Kookaburras usually eat small animals: small mammals (like mice), insects, small birds, lizards and snakes. 

Kookaburras usually live in family groups. Young kookaburras help their parents to hunt and care for the smaller children.

Kookaburras are well known for their loud call, which sounds a bit like human laughter. Kookaburras use their calling to show others their territory.
