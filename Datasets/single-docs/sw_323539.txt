Adderall

Amphetamine mixed salts (also known as amphetamine and dextroamphetamine mixed salts, amphetamine salt combo, or simply amphetamine salts) is a medication used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is sold under the brand name Adderall. The drug contains a mixture of the salts of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Both of these salts act as stimulants. The drug therefore helps people stay alert and concentrate on what they are doing. The downside of this medication is decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.

The sustained-release (or extended-release) formulation is sold under the brand name Adderall XR. This formulation is designed to provide therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations. This is the same as taking two doses 4 hours apart. The normal dosage of Adderall XR is 20 milligrams.
