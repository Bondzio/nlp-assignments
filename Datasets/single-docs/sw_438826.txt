Roma, Gotland

Roma (also referred to as Romakloster) is a locality (Swedish "tätort") in Gotland Municipality, Gotland County, Sweden. In 2010, 913 people lived there.

In 1995 the locality known as Roma was divided by Statistics Sweden into a part with the tentative name of "Roma kyrkby" or "Lövsta" (pop. 277) and the remaining part that retained the name "Roma" (pop. 913), but is using to as "Romakloster" as postal address.
Some confusion is caused by the fact that Lövsta/Roma kyrkby has been referred to as "Roma" in the statistical figures since 2000.
