Apotropaic magic

Apotropaism or apotropaic magic is the use of magic rituals against evil or harmful influences like the evil eye or "invidia", which was thought to cause injury or bad luck. This can be a long ritual, or it can take the form of simply wearing an amulet or other token, "against bad luck".
