Disinformation

Disinformation is false or inaccurate information that is spread on purpose and is intended to mislead. It may include the handing out of forged documents, manuscripts, and photographs, or propagation of malicious rumors and fabricated intelligence. Quite often this word is used in context of a government or large organisation trying to fool a rival.
