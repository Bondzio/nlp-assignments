Buick Rendezvous

Buick Rendezvous was a midsize crossover SUV. It was built by General Motors from 2002 to 2007. The Rendezvous was built on a short wheelbase of the GM U/minivan platform similar to the Pontiac Aztek. It slotted between the Rainier SUV and the Terraza minivan. From 2002 to 2006 it offered the option of front wheel-drive or all-wheel drive, this was dropped for the final model year. The Rendezvous was later discontinued due to a drop in sales and replaced by the slightly larger Buick Enclave CUV which also replaced the Rainier and Terraza.
