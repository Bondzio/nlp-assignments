The Wheel of Time

The Wheel of Time is a long running fantasy series of novels by Robert Jordan. The first in the series, "The Eye of the World" was published in 1990, and the last, "A Memory of Light", was published in 2009. The author died while he was writing the last book, so it will be finished by Brandon Sanderson. "A Memory of Light" was split into three parts as the book length was too long.
