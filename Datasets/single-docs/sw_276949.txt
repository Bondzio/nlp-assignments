Nintendo 3DS

The Nintendo 3DS is a handheld video game console made by Nintendo, which can display 3D effects without the need for any special glasses. Like the Wii, it has a Mii Maker application, letting the user create their own personal avatar, which some games use to replace the standard characters. It was released in Japan on February 26, 2011, on March 25, 2011 in Europe and on March 27, 2011 in the United States. The Nintendo 3DS lets the user play games in either 2D or 3D. A slider lets the player change the level of 3D in the game. The Nintendo 3DS also lets the user play Nintendo DS games, but only in 2D. It comes with extra channels (some have to be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop), such as Nintendo Video, Nintendo Zone, and Swapnote. The system has a camera on the inside, and two on the outside. The outer cameras let the user both take pictures in 3D and shoot videos up to 10 minutes long in 3D.

The Nintendo 3DS was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010. 

On August 12, 2011, Nintendo cut the price of the 3DS to $170. People who got it when it was at the higher price of $250 got 10 free Nintendo Entertainment System games, along with 10 free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop.

A bigger version, called the Nintendo 3DS XL, was shown to the public on June 21, 2012. This version has screens much larger than the regular 3DS'. It was released on August 19, 2012 (along with "New Super Mario Bros. 2"), and currently costs $199.

A new version of the console, called the Nintendo 2DS, was released on October 12, 2013.
