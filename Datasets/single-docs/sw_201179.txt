Black dwarf

A black dwarf is a kind of star. A black dwarf is created when a white dwarf star becomes too cool. Then it can no longer create large amounts of heat and light. The star will dim and become black. Black dwarfs are not confirmed to exist because it takes longer than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years) for a white dwarf to become one.
