Tantya Tope

Ramachandra Pandurang Tope (1814â€“1859) was an Indian brahmin and general in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Tope was born in 1814, the only son of Rao Tope and his wife Rukhmabai. Tope was a close associate of Nana Saheb. In the Siege of Cawnpore, British East India Company forces and civilians were under siege by Indian forces led by Saheb and Tope. They surrendered under the condition they would be given safe passage. But they were attacked by Indian forces and all but 210 women and children were killed. The captives were later killed in a house called Bibighar. The British relief forces killed anyone suspected of taking part in the killings. By the time British forces reached Cawnpore (now Kanpur), Tope and Saheb had left. Tope turned to Guerrilla warfare. For the next year he fought against the British while his own forces were becoming fewer and fewer. In April, 1859, Tope was betrayed by an aide and captured by the British. He was given a short trial and executed on April 18, 1859.
