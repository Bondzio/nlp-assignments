Suzuki

Suzuki is a Japanese company that makes cars and motorcycles. It had a stake in CAMI Automotive with General Motors. After the discontinuation of Chevrolet Tracker CAMI started producing the Equinox, as well as the Suzuki XL-7 SUV. Suzuki also sold three Daewoo models in the U.S. and Canada, the Kalos, Lacetti and Magnus. Suzuki backed out of the venture in 2010 after the redesigned XL-7 did not match sales demands. In 2012 Suzuki stopped making cars for the American market. It will continue to build and sell ATVs, motorcycles and army vehicles.
