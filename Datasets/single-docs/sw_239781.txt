Gotta Get Away

"Gotta Get Away" is a song by the Californian punk rock group The Offspring. It was released as the third and last single from the album "Smash" (1994). The song was a modest hit in several countries, while it peaked at #6 on Billboard's Modern Rock charts in the United States. "Gotta Get Away" was inspired by an early track, "Cogs", written while the band was still named Manic Subsidal. The lyrics refer to the pressure that lead singer Dexter Holland was under to finish the album on time.
