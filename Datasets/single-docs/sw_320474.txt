Dark adaptor goggles

Dark adaptor goggles are used in the field of meteorology. They are used for either adapting the eyes to the dark before an observation at night or to help with the identification of clouds during bright sunshine or glare from snow. The goggles are made with red-tinted plastic lenses. The goggles are designed to be worn inside but some people find walking, especially up and down stairs, to be hard.
