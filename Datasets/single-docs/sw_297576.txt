List of European stadiums by capacity

The list contains European stadiums with a capacity of at least 25,000. Almost all of these stadiums were built mainly for association football. Most of the rest were built for athletics, the rugby codes, or (in Ireland) Gaelic games.

An asterisk (*) indicates that a team does not play all of its home matches at said stadium.
