<poem>
"Through these low grounds of sorrow, toil and strife,"
"As runs the troubled stream of human life,"
"Why should the poor laborious crowd repine?"
"For wealth, for honour, lovely Jane were thine,"
"Yet my sad tale examplifies in thee,"
"How equal are our shares of misery"
"Or in the highest, or the humblest lot,
"The king's proud palace, or the straw-roof'd cot."
