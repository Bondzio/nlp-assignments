Nectophrynoides

Nectophrynoides is a genus of true toads. They live in Eastern Arc forests and wetlands in Tanzania. All but "N. tornieri" are threatened. Species of the genus are ovoviviparous: fertilization is internal, and the females give birth to fully developed, small toadlets. Together with the West Africa "Nimbaphrynoides", they are the only frogs/toads in the world that do not lay eggs.
