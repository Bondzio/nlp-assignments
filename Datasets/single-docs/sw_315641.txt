Ōita Prefecture

In the 6th century, one of the regions of Kyushu was divided into Bungo Province and Buzen Province. 

After the Meiji Restoration, districts from Bungo and Buzen provinces were combined to form Ōita Prefecture.


Ōita Prefecture is on the north-eastern section of the island of Kyūshū. 

Ōita is faces the Suo Channel and Honshū Island to the north. The prefecture looks towards the Iyo Channel and Shikoku Island to the east. It is bordered by Miyazaki Prefecture to the south. Fukuoka Prefecture and Kumamoto Prefecture are to the west.


National Parks are established in about 28% of the total land area of the prefecture.

"Sasamuta-jinja", "Usa-jinjū" and "Yusuhara Hachiman-gū" are the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") in the prefecture.

Fukiji Temple has the oldest wooden structure in Kyushu.

The Usuki Buddhas include 60+ cliff carvings from Heian period.
