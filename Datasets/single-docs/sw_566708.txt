Tithe

A tithe, meaning a tenth-part, is money or agricultural products paid to a religious organization. A tithe can be seen as a a tax, a fee for a service or a voluntary contribution. Traditionally, a title is one-tenth of a person's income paid to the Church. Tithing came from the Book of Numbers. In ancient Israel, the tribe of Levi were the priests. The other tribes gave tithes to the tribe of Levi because they had been given no land in Canaan.

Under the Law of Moses a tenth part is given to the priests. Then, the priests were required to give a tenth part of what they received as an offering to God. These tithes were paid once a year.

In France, tithes were taxes levied by The Roman Catholic Church before the French Revolution. Tithes were levied on the Third Estate (common people), which made up about 98% of the French population. The Tithes were taxes for land owned by members of the Third Estate. The tithe was abolished after the creation of The New Constitution of France in 1791, when the Constitution was completed.
