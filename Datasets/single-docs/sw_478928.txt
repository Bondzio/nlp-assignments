Demis Roussos

Artemios "Demis" Ventouris Roussos (, 15 June 1946 â€“ 25 January 2015) was a Egyptian-born Greek singer and performer. He had international hit records as a solo performer in the 1970s after having been a member of Aphrodite's Child.

He sold over 60 million albums worldwide and became "an unlikely kaftan-wearing sex symbol".

Roussos died in Athens, Greece, aged 68.
