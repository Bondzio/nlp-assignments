Stormbreaker (movie)

Stormbreaker is a 2005 British movie based on the Anthony Horowitz novel "Stormbreaker", part of the Alex Rider series of books.

The plot is the same as the novel.

There are some changes from the novel. For example, the main bad guy, Sayle, is changed from Lebanese to American, since the actor picked did not have a Lebanese accent.
