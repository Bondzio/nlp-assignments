Geodesic dome

A geodesic dome is a type of structure that looks like half a ball shape (like half a soccer ball), made of many little shapes, usually triangles. It often is made of glass, concrete, or steel. They are cheap to make, and bigger than square buildings. It was first created by Buckminster Fuller.
