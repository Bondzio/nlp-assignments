Uppercut

An uppercut in boxing is a punch that usually aims for the opponent's chin and therefore it is known in the common language also as hook to the chin (for example in German: "Kinnhaken").

In the technical language one does not use the expression "hook to the chin", because as a rule one calls a "hook" a punch from the side with the lead hand and almost always the chin is the target of punches.

The uppercut is often used to start or finish a set of punches.

The uppercut is led from the region of navel in a going up move, therefore the shape of hook remains, before the fist reaches the opponent's or body. Other variants, for example in the Thai boxing, are not striked from the region of stomach. Instead, the boxer drops the fist from the cover only so long outside, as is necessary for shooting with enough force. Pulling down the fist to the stomach extends the way, increases the needed time and therefore the opponent's chance to use the open cover in his favor for a punch.

An uppercut is very best performed in the closeness, then as the distance to the opponent increases the chance to not strike him arises. An uppercut causes as a rule the biggest damage, if it reaches the opponent's chin, but also torso, nose and eyes are typical targets.

It belongs for this reason to the techniques of infight.

Almost always it concerns uppercuts of the rear hand, but there are (or there were) also boxers as Aaron Pryor and Ricardo LÃ³pez who outside the normal play regularly stroke a left uppercut. Michel Trabant succeeded with a left uppercut a knock-out of single punch against the fiercely attacking Marc Waelkens.

Among others, Joe Louis was known for his uppercut.
