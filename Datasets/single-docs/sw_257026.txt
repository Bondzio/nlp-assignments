Lawrence, Kansas

Lawrence is a city in the state of Kansas in the United States. It is in the northeastern part of the state, near the Kansas City area, and is in Douglas County. In 2009, about 92,000 people lived there. The University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University are in Lawrence.

In 1854, a group of people who were against slavery started Lawrence. (This was before Kansas became a state. Kansas did not become a state until January 29, 1861.) Many people had moved to Kansas because a law called the Kansas-Nebraska Act said that people could vote on whether slavery would be allowed there or not. These people moved there so they could vote.

A newspaper was started in 1854 called the "Kansas Pioneer". The writers of the newspapers wrote about their beliefs that slavery was wrong.

On August 21, 1863, a man named William Quantrill, who wanted slavery to be legal, rode into Lawrence with some men and destroyed much of the town. They killed every adult man they saw. More than 150 men died.

Today, Lawrence is called a "college town" because the University of Kansas is a big part of the city. There are many places in town where students like to go.
