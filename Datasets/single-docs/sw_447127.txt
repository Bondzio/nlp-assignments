Trust Company (band)

Trust Company (also known by the typeset TRUSTcompany and TRUST*CO) is an American alternative metal/post-grunge band from Prattville, Alabama. 

Trust Company was formed in 1997 by lead singer Kevin Palmer and drummer Jason Singleton. They originally named the band 41 Down but changed it later to avoid being confused with Canadian punk rock band Sum 41. Palmer and Singleton would later recruit bassist Josh Moates and guitarist James Fukai. After they released a few demos and a self-titled album, the band was signed to Geffen Records. They released their debut album "The Lonely Position of Neutral" on July 23, 2002. The album features the single "Downfall" which received heavy exposure from MTV2. Their second studio album "True Parallels" was released on March 22, 2005. It featured the single "Stronger". In August 2005, Trust Company took a break to work on other projects and to rest. During the break, Palmer and Moates started a band called Amity Lane. On August 11, 2007, they announced that they were reuniting. The band released their third studio album "Dreaming in Black and White" on March 8, 2011. The album featured the single "Heart in My Hands".
