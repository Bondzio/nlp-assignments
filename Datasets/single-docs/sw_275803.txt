Rites of Spring

Rites of Spring was an American post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C. in the mid-1980s, known for their fact, jumpy live performances. A part of the D.C. hardcore punk scene, Rites of Spring increased the violence and passion of hardcore while at the same time experimenting with its rules. Lyrically, they also moved hardcore into very personal realms and, in doing so, are usually considered the first emo band.

The band only performed 15 concerts. Vocalist/guitarist Guy Picciotto and drummer Brendan Canty went on to play in the influential post-hardcore band Fugazi in the late 1980s.
