Burton's Gentleman's Magazine

Burton's Gentleman's Magazine was a 19th-century American men's magazine. It was founded by William Evans Burton, and published between 1837 and 1841 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The magazine focused on material of interest to American gentlemen of the period such as sports, fiction, theater, art, and the western frontier.

Edgar Allan Poe sent short stories to the magazine that included "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "William Wilson". He edited it from 1839 until 1840. The magazine merged with "Atkinson's Casket" to become "Graham's Magazine".
