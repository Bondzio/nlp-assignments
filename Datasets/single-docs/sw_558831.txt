William Dampier

William Dampier (baptised 5 September 1651; died March 1715) was the first Englishman to explore parts of Australia. He was the first person to circumnavigate the world three times. On one voyage he rescued Alexander Selkirk, a sailor who may have inspired Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe".
