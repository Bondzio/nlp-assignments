Theodor W. Adorno

Theodor W. Adorno (September 11, 1903 â€“ August 6, 1969) was a German sociologist, philosopher, composer, and music theorist. He designed the F-scale with other researchers at the University of California. This scale tried to measure "the authoritarian personality", the "F" standing for "Fascist". He wrote about this with them in the controversial 1950 book "The Authoritarian Personality." He was a Marxist.
