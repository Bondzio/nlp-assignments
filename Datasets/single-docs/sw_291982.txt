Thief (Our Lady Peace song)

"'Thief'" is a 1999 alternative rock song by the Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace and is the third single from their third studio album "Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch", which was released in 1999. The song was written by Raine Maida and was produced by Arnold Lanni.

Our Lady Peace said that the song was about a young girl from Kitchener, Ontario named Mina Kim who had a cancerous tumor in her brain. The word thief in the song refers to the tumor and at the end of the song there is a sound clip of a young girl that is actually Mina Kim singing a "Little By Little" with Maida's wife Chantal Kreviazuk.
