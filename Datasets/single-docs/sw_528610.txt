Aldebaran

Aldebaran (α Tau, α Tauri, Alpha Tauri) is an orange giant star. It is about 65 light years away in the zodiac constellation of Taurus. With an average apparent magnitude of 0.87 it is the brightest star in the constellation and is one of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky. The name "Aldebaran" is Arabic ( "") and means "the Follower", presumably because it rises near and soon after the Pleiades.

In 1993 a companion body was reported. A paper recently accepted shows evidence for a planetary companion.
