Fisting

Fisting is a sexual activity. The fister puts his or her hand into the vagina or rectum. The fingers are then clenched into a fist or kept straight. Fisting may be done with or without a partner.

Fistees is another form of fisting. It is for the more experienced. It may take two fists. This is called double fisting. Double fisting pleasure depends more on stretching of the anus or vagina rather than thrusting with an in-and-out movement of the hands.

Fisting can cause lacerations to the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon. This may result in serious injury. These lacerations may even lead to death. Sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot. The risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.

Fisting can cause cutting or tearing or of the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon, resulting in serious injury and even death. In general, sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot, and the risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.
