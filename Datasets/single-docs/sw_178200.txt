Wudu

Wudu ( al-wuū', "ābdast", , wazū') is the Islamic act of washing parts of the body using water. It is necessary to do this before one prays.

Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلّم) said, "When the Muslim - or believing - slave does wudu' and washes his face, every wrong thing at which his eyes have looked leaves with the water - or with the last drop of water. When he washes his hands, every wrong thing which his hands have touched leaves with the water - or with the last drop of water. When he washes his feet. every wrong thing to which his feet have walked leaves with the water – or with the last drop of water, until he emerges cleansed of sins." [Muslim 1/148 and others]
