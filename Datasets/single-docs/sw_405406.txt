Monarchy of Pakistan

The Monarchy of Pakistan was the form of government of the Dominion of Pakistan from 1947 to 1956. Under this system, Pakistan was an independent Commonwealth realm with a hereditary, constitutional monarch as the head of state. The monarch was the monarch of the United Kingdom, and was also shared with a number of other countries. The role of the monarch was defined under the Constitution. Most of the monarch's duties were carried out by the Governor-General of Pakistan.

The monarchy of Pakistan was created by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. This act, made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, divided its British India into two new countries: India and Pakistan, each of which became an independent constitutional monarchy. Succession to the throne of Pakistan was, like that of the United Kingdom, governed by the Act of Settlement 1701.

Pakistan adopted a new constitution on 23 March 1956. This constitution abolished the monarchy, making Pakistan a republic in the Commonwealth of Nations. Pakistan left the Commonwealth in 1972, but rejoined in 1989.
