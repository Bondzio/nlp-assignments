Alkali Ridge

Alkali Ridge, also known as Alkali Point, is a set of widely scattered archaeological remains of the earliest forms of Puebloan architecture. They represent a period of change from scattered, pit-style dwellings to a settled agricultural lifestyle. These multi-story buildings and kivas have yielded high-quality ceramics. They form the type location for the Pueblo II period ("ca." 900 CE - "ca." 1100 CE).

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964.
