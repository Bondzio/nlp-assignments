STG-44

The STG-44, known as the world's first assault rifle, was developed in Nazi Germany during World War II, replacing the MP-40. Hitler first did not approve of this new class of weapons, so it was called MP-43 and MP-44, meaning Machine Pistol (in English). The first service on the Eastern Front was successful. Hitler told them to make more, and they were called StG-44 meaning "Storm Rifle".
