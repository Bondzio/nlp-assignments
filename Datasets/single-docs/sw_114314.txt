Parade

A parade is a large or small group of people who all walk together, usually down a street or road. People who walk in parades are often dressed in costumes, and followed by marching bands, floats or large balloons.

They are often held on holidays or to honor someone. Parades are held for many reasons, but are usually for celebrations of some kind. Days like St Patrick's Day are often celebrated with a parade. 

A military parade is one of the most common parades. It is when soldiers march in public. Usually they are followed by tanks and other military vehicles. Military parades are often held after a battle or war has been won. In the United States, military parades are usually held on Veterans Day and Independence Day. The official birthday of the Sovereign is marked each year by aÂ military parade by the British Army.

One of the most famous parades is the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City. Over 44 million people watch this parade on television each year.
