Barabbas

Barabbas is a person from the Bible who lived around the time of Jesus (33 AD). He has a bad reputation for being a liar, thief, insurrectionist and zealot. He was released by Pontius Pilate the Roman governor of Judea who presided over Jesus' trial. The most notable thing about Barabbas is that this name was his surname (last name), but his first name was also Jesus. So when Pilate — who was warned by his wife to leave this Holy man alone — offered to set free one of the prisoners, he was offering the crowd in Jerusalem two Jesuses to choose from: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus of Nazareth. Pilate released Barabbas and ordered Jesus, "King of the Jews", to be crucified.
