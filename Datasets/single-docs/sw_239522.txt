Battle of the Alamo

The Battle of the Alamo took place in 1836 at the Alamo in what is now San Antonio, Texas, which is now in the United States. At the time, Texas belonged to Mexico, but many people in Texas wanted it to leave Mexico and become a new country. Over 100 of these people, including former Congressman Davy Crockett, were in the Alamo, which was a mission (which is like a church) when a Mexican army of several thousand, led by General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna, arrived. For 13 days, the Mexican army surrounded the Alamo, then attacked on March 6, 1836. All 187 of the men from Texas were killed. 

General Sam Houston felt that holding San Antonio was unnecessary and impossible. Houston sent Jim Bowie with orders to destroy the Alamo and return with all of the men and artillery stationed there. Bowie went against his orders, thinking he needed to defend the city, and failed.
