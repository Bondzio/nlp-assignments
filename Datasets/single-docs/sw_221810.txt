Treehouse of Horror II

"Treehouse of Horror II" is the seventh episode of The Simpsons third season, the second Simpsons Halloween episode, and the first Halloween episode where names in the closing credits were replaced by 'spooky name' parodies. The episode first started on October 31, 1991. The first part, "The Monkey's Paw", is a direct reference to W.W. Jacobs's short story The Monkey's Paw, in which the Simpsons's wishes all backfire on them after buying a hand of a monkey. In the second part, "The Bart Zone", Bart has powers, and turns Homer into a jack-in-the-box, in the two spending more time together. The part was a parody of The Twilight Zone episode "It's a Good Life". In the last part, "If I Only Had A Brain", Mr. Burns's head is onto Homer's head after Mr. Burns tries to create a robot with Homer's brain.
