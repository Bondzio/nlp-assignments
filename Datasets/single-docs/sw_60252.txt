William Blake

William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker. He was born in London and died there.

During his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. Blake's first collection of poems, "Poetical Sketches", was printed around 1783. His most famous poem "And did those feet in ancient time" was, over 100 years later, put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called "Jerusalem". 

Blake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organized by the BBC in 2002.
