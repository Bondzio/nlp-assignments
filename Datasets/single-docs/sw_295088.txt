Teatre Sans

Teatre Sans is a small theatre in Palma de Mallorca, capital of the Balearic Islands, Spain, that has been opened for more than 25 years. 

The theatre is in a gothic building from the 14th-15th centuries, in the old neighbourhood of the city. In the 15th century it belonged to the island Governor who used it as a marketplace. Later it was used as lodgings. In the 20th century, it became the headquarters of the Republican party where they held political meetings, literary and cultural gatherings and some theatre plays. Later, they also began to offer lectures and talks.

In 1984, the theatre company TRIP TRUP Teatre (later Estudi Zero Teatre ESTUDI ZERO), rented the theatre as a place for reheasals. The theatre company ESTUDI ZERO renovated the old theatre and they are now responsible running not only the theatre, but also the drama school and the café.

The drama school, eScola d'Arts eScéNiques offers drama lessons to children and adults and it is one of the main reasons of the popularity of the theatre.
