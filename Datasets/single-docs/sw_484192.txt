Cermet

A cermet is a ceramic material, like porcelain or clay, mixed with a metal, like steel or copper. They are long lasting, tough composite materials that are stress resistant and produce little friction. Cermets also have the properties of metals. They can conduct electricity. Like metals cermets are somewhat malleable.
