Bible for children

Children's Bibles, or Bibles for children, are often collections of Bible stories rather than actual translations of the Bible aimed at children.

The earliest Bible for children printed in America was "The Children's Bible" (Philadelphia, 1763). "The Bible Story" (1953â€“57) is a ten-volume series of hardcover children's story books written by Arthur Maxwell. It is based on the King James and Revised Standard versions of the Christian Bible. "The Children's Bible Story Book" (1991) is a children's version of the Bible by Anne de Graaf. It is distributed to British primary schools by the charity Bibles for Children (founded 1997).

Actual Bible versions include the New Century Version, a simplified English revision of the International Children's Bible.
