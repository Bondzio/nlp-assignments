Molotov-Ribbentrop pact

The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (otherwise known as the Nazi-Soviet Pact) was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov (Russian foreign minister working for Stalin) and Joachim von Ribbentropp (German foreign minister working for Hitler) on 23 August, 1939. The pact promised that neither Russia nor Germany would attack the other. It also divided Poland between them.

However, after the pact (treaty) was signed, Hitler broke it in 1941. This was part of a series of conflicts in World War II.
