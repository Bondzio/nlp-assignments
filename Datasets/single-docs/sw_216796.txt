Sheila Mello

Sheila Chesed de Almeida Mello (born 23 July 1978) is a Brazilian dancer, actress and model. She became famous for dancing in the band É o Tchan!

Was born in Cidade Ademar, a district on the outskirts of São Paulo. Before becoming known for her participation in the group É o Tchan!, Sheila graduated in both classical ballet and in modern ballet.
Her entry to the group É o Tchan! came in 1998 through a contest held to choose a replacement for the dancer Carla Perez who left the group. Immediately after her victory she posed nude for the first time in Playboy magazine. She was on the cover in the other two editions, one next to Sheila Carvalho, her colleague É o Tchan. In October 2007, she posed naked again, this time for the magazine Sexy.
