The Ant and the Aardvark

The Ant And The Aardvark is a series of 17 short cartoons released between March 5,1969 and June 20,1971

The cartoons follow attempts of a blue aardvark named Aardvark (voiced by John Byner), to catch and eat a red ant named Charlie (also voiced by John Byner. Aardvark does this by inhaling with a loud vacuum cleaner sound. In the episode "Rough Brunch", he claims his name is simply "Aardvark." Charlie Ant gives his several names as sly terms of endearment (Ol' Sam, Ol' Ben, Ol' Blue, Claude, Pal, Buddy, Daddy-O). In several bumper sequences of "The Pink Panther Show", he is called "Blue Aardvark."

All voices provided by John Byner unless otherwise noted.
