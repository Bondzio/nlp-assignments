Helen

Helen is a person in Greek mythology. She is said to be the most beautiful woman in the world and is an important person in the Trojan War, and Homer's "Iliad". Other books of ancient Greek give small and contradictory details of her life.

Helen was the daughter of the god Zeus and Leda, the wife of King Tyndareos of Sparta. Her brothers were Castor and Polydeukes, and her sister was Klytaimnestra.

Helen was married to Menelaus, and was queen of Sparta. With Menelaus she had a daughter, Hermione. Paris met her there, and took her away to Troy. This was one of the main causes of the Trojan War.

Was influenced by Atalanta, the huntress.
