Elizabeth Barrett Browning

Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) was an English poet who is famous for writing her love poems, "Sonnets from the Portuguese" (1850). She was born in Kelloe, County Durham. She was married to the poet and playwright Robert Browning. She died in Florence, Italy. She suffered from many illnesses. Some of them included anorexia, TB, neurasthenia, pertussis, an encephalomyelitis, non-paralytic poliomyelitis, paralytic scoliosis, or opium addiction or a mental illness including anxiety and agoraphobia. There's an apocryphal story of her falling off her horse when she was 15, but she always insisted it had nothing to do with her illness. She had to spend a lot of time away from her husband, staying abroad in coastal countries as she had trouble breathing, an effect of her illnesses.
