Calgary Transit

Calgary Transit is Calgary's public transit system. It operates both buses and light-rail transit trains. Calgary Transit operates about 1,125 buses and trains, and serves Calgary's population of over 1 million. Most Calgary Transit vehicles are designed with three stripes; one light blue, one blue and one dark blue. This design was changed in 2007 to red and grey.

The C-Train runs on two major routes in Calgary; the north-east route, and the north-west to south route. There are currently 39 stations, 26 of which are major with heated areas.

There are three types of C-Train vehicles currently in service.

Calgary Transit currently runs over 160 bus routes, of which 86 are designated as "low access", and are accessible for those who need a wheelchair to move around. Calgary uses buses from four companies; Nova Bus, New Flyer Industries, General Motors Diesel Division and Motor Coach Industries. In 2004, Calgary Transit started a bus rapid transit service along future C-Train routes. The bus rapid transit routes have less stops than other routes, and use articulated buses as of 2007.

Below are the costs of using Calgary Transit as of March, 2011.
