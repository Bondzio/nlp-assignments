M. T. Liggett

Myron Thomas "M. T." Liggett (December 28, 1930 – August 17, 2017) was an American folk sculptor. He was born near Mullinville, Kansas. He exhibited hundreds of his artworks on the roads of Mullinville. 

His works were often made of painted, welded metal and often contained re-used farm implements, such as combine discs. His art is often critical of politicians on the local, state, and federal level. Many of his works are kinetic and move with the wind. 

Liggett's main work was the land along his front fence, on the north side of U.S. Route 400 in Mullinville. He was also a featured artist at the Folk Art Museum in Lucas, Kansas.
He and some of his sculptures appear in the 2009 documentary What's the Matter with Kansas?.

Liggett died on August 17, 2017 in Mullinville, Kansas of pneumonia-related complications at the age of 86.
