Harry Dean Stanton

Harry Dean Stanton (born July 14, 1926) is an American actor, musician, and singer. He is known for his roles in "Paris, Texas", "Kelly's Heroes", "Dillinger", "Alien", "Repo Man", "Pretty In Pink", "The Last Temptation of Christ", "Wild at Heart", "The Green Mile", "The Pledge", and "Rango".

Stanton was a favorite of the late movie critic Roger Ebert who has said that "no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad." However, Ebert later admitted that "Dream a Little Dream" (1989), in which Stanton appeared, was a "clear violation" of this rule.

Stanton was born on July 14, 1926 in West Irvine, Kentucky. He studied at the University of Kentucky.
