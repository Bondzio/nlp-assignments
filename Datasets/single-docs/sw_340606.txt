French colonial empire

The French colonial Empire was land under French rule from the 17th century to the late 1960s. In the 17th and 18th centuries France gained and lost large territories in North America and India.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the colonial empire of France was the second-largest in the world behind the British Empire. Because it was so big, many people now speak French.
