Cnidaria

Cnidaria is a phylum with about 11,000 species of animals. All of them are simple and aquatic, and most of them live in the sea. Some are colonial, composed of zooids which may be clones. Cnidarian zooids may take the form of polyps or medusae at different phases of their life.

Cnidaria take their name from special cells which have organelles that sting: the nematocysts. This device is largely responsible for their success: it is their main specialised and distinctive cell type.

The word Cnidaria is spoken without the initial "C", and with a long "i". So it sounds like "Naidaria". In a similar way, the term Ctenophore is pronounced as "Teenophore". Originally, a Greek kappa was in front of the words, and it was pronounced.

There are five classes in the group. Jellyfish occur in four of the classes. 

Unranked, but now known to be cnidarians, is the parasitic group Myxozoa.

The Cnidaria often have complex life cycles, with both sexual and asexual reproduction. If this is the case, a generation that reproduces asexually will follow a generation that reproduces sexually.

Some Cnidarians, such as "Polypodium hydriforme" and the group Myxozoa are parasites. Some live in symbiosis with algae that do photosynthesis. Most of these algae are dinoflagellates, but sometimes they are green algae. The algae take the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen and carbohydrates, which the cnidarian uses as source of food.

There is a long fossil record for the corals, and soft-bodied forms appear in some exceptional strata. Some are believed to be among the Ediacaran biota.
