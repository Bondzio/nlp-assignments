Kuiper belt

The Kuiper belt is an area of the Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune (at 30 Astronomical units) to 50 AU from the Sun. 

The objects within the Kuiper Belt together with the members of the "scattered disk" beyond, are together called trans-Neptunian.

Many objects such as dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt are much bigger than the ones in the asteroid belt. At least some Kuiper belt objects are icebound.

After the Kuiper belt was discovered in 1992, the number of known Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has added to over a thousand, and more than 70,000 KBOs over 100 km (62 mi) in diameter.
