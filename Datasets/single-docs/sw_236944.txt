List of Provinces of Japan

The List of Provinces of Japan changed over time. The number and borders of provinces evolved from the 7th century through the Meiji Period. In the 1870s, the provinces were replaced by prefectures.

The traditional way of parsing the land of Japan was "five provinces and seven circuits" ("go-shichidō").

The traditional five core provinces of Japan were called "goki". 


The traditional seven core circuits of Japan were called "shichidō".








The island was changed from Ezo to Hokkaidō, and 11 provinces were established in 1869-1882.
