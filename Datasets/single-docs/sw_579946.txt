Sky Sport News HD

Sky Sport News HD is Germany and Austria's only 24-hour free-to-air sports news channel, owned by Sky Sport Deutschland.

The channel's format shows rolling news bulletins, updated every 15 minutes. It broadcast live from 7am to 1am. There are four team of presenters on air daily: one from 7am to 11am, one from 11am to 4pm, one from 4pm to 9pm and finally one from 9pm to 1am.

SSNHD launched on 1 December 2011, at 12pm. The first on-air team was Kate Abdo and Thomas Fleischmann. 

However, in 2016, at the 5th birthday, Sky Deutschland announced that the channel will become free-to-air and can be streamed online for German viewers only. It kickstart by simulcast the full-length match Mainz vs Bayern on Sky Sport Bundesliga 1.

The channel's content is now wider. Alongside rolling-news, it also plays highlights, documentaries and magazines from a major part on the world of sport. It is only allowed to play 12 minutes of ads every hour.

Sky also announced that, from 1/6/2017, Sky Sport News HD would reduce its broadcasting time from 18 hours a day to just 15 (9am-midnight). The decision was taken because viewers turn to the channel more frequently during this period. Also, the number of teams of presenter is now 3 instead of 4: one from 9am to 2pm, another from 2pm to 7pm and finally another one from 7pm to midnight.

On 12 March 2017, Sky Sport News HD started streaming its programming online on its website (above).

On around June 2017, the channel moved its 24/7 livestream to the official website of Sky Sport.

The news bulletin is always anchored by a man and a woman. Here's the channel's team.
