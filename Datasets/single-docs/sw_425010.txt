Vidkun Quisling

Vidkun Quisling (18 July 1887 â€“ 24 October 1945) was a Norwegian politician. He was involved in the German invasion of Norway during World War II. On 9 April 1940, with the invasion in progress, he seized power of the country with the help of the Nazis and became Minister President. His government helped the Nazi German government to find Jews, who were then killed. In 1945, when Germany lost the war, Vidkun was put on trial for high treason. He was found guilty, and then executed by firing squad. Today, the name "quisling" is still used as a way of calling someone a traitor.
