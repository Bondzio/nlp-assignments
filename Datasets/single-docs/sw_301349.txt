Marcus Claudius Tacitus

Marcus Claudius Tacitus was a Roman Emperor between 275 and 276AD. He lived between about 200 to 276AD.

He was born in Italy and replaced Aurelian as emperor. After his death, the Roman senate made Tacitus emperor. This was the last time the Senate chose an emperor.
The first thing he did was fight against the mercenaries that Aurelian used to fight enemies in Asia. These mercenaries were unhappy because the campaign that they had been hired for hadn't happened. They had destroyed several Roman cites in Asia.
He was about to fight the Franks and Alamanni (different Barbarian tribes) in France when he died of fever.
