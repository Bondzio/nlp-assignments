TNA Lockdown

Lockdown is a yearly pay-per-view made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). The event is usually produced in April. The first Slammiversary event took place on April 24, 2005 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. 

The event features a Six Sides of Steel cage when the ring still had 6 sides. They switched to a normal, 4-sided steel cage in 2010. They also have gimmick matches such as the "Lethal Lockdown" (which is a variant of the WarGames match that was popularized in World Championship Wrestling), the "Xscape match" which is a multi-competitor elimination cage match where the last two remaining competitors must climb over or use the door to escape the cage, and the "Queen of the Cage match" which featured TNA Knockouts.
