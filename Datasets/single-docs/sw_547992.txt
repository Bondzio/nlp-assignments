Bernardo Provenzano

Bernardo Provenzano (; 31 January 1933 â€“ 13 July 2016) was a member of the Sicilian Mafia ("Cosa Nostra"). He was suspected of having been the head of the Corleonesi, a Mafia faction from the town of Corleone. He was the de facto "capo di tutti capi" (boss of all bosses) of the entire Sicilian Mafia until his arrest in 2006.

On 13 July 2016, Provenzano died from complications of bladder cancer at a hospital in prison at age 83.
