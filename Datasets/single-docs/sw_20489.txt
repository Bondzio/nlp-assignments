Pinocchio

Pinocchio is a fictional character from the 1883 book "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi.

Pinocchio is a puppet, made by wood carver, Gepetto. When he tells lies, his nose gets longer. Pinocchio learns about being a real life boy and wants to be a real human being instead of a puppet made of wood and strings.

The most well-known version of the story is the 1940 animated Disney movie "Pinocchio".
