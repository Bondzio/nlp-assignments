Kid Nation

Kid Nation was a reality show. It first aired on the CBS network on September 19, 2007. The show featured 40 children, aged 8â€“15, living in a ghost town named "Bonanza Town". No one had lived in the town since the 19th century. The children were required to create a functioning society in the town, as well as set up a government system used to solve problems in the town. 

At the end of each episode the council awards a cash prize which is a "gold star" worth $20,000 to one of the kids.
