Johannes Heesters

Johan Marius Nicolaas "Johannes" Heesters (5 December 1903 - 24 December 2011) was a Dutch actor, singer, and entertainer. 

He worked for 91 years, and almost always worked in German-speaking Europe. Heesters was one of the oldest working people in entertainment. Some people have had problems with Heesters because he once sang for Adolf Hitler. He also supported the Nazi's during World War II.

Heesters was married twice: to Belgian actress Louise Ghijs (1906-1985) from 1930 until her death and from 1992-2011 to Simone Rethel. Heesters has two daughters from his first marriage and five grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren, twenty-five great-great-grandchildren and one great-great-great-grandson as of 2011. His younger daughter Nicole Heesters is a well-known actress in the German-speaking world, as is his granddaughter Saskia Fischer.

On 1 January 2008, he fell down some stairs in his holiday house in Tyrol and broke two ribs.

On 29 November 2011, he suddenly fell ill and was rushed into a hospital. He was operated on to fit a heart pacemaker. He was allowed home less than a week later. This was in time to spend his 108th birthday the next day with family. He did not feel strong enough to make the planned stage appearance to sing in celebration of his birthday. He also missed the premiere of his latest movie, "Ten". Due to a relapse in his condition, on 17 December he went back to the hospital. He had a stroke and died on Christmas Eve 2011.
