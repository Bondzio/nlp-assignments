Reasonable accommodation

Reasonable accommodation is a necessary aid or support for persons with disabilities or other persons in weak situations, such as minority groups, but not to make an unreasonable burden on the society. This idea is born in American and Canadian lawsuits to abolish discrimination on the job and is also used by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Article 2.
