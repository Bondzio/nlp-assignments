Lanyard

A lanyard is a cord or strap. It is made to help the wearer keep and use some basic items of equipment, especially small items. It is usually worn around the neck with an ID card or keys. 

Lanyards were first introduced in the 15th century. In the military, lanyards are worn on the shoulders of uniforms to denote the wearer's qualification or regimental affiliation.
