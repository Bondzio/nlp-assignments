Division of Mitchell

The Division of Mitchell is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It is named after Major Thomas Mitchell, surveyor and explorer who was the first European to explore large areas of New South Wales and Victoria. It was set up in 1949.

The division covers the north-west suburbs of Sydney. It includes Baulkham Hills, Beaumont Hills, Bella Vista, Box Hill, Kellyville, Nelson and Winston Hills. It also includes parts of Castle Hill, North Rocks, Northmead, Maraylya, Rouse Hill and West Pennant Hills. 

After the 2013 federal election, Mitchell became the safest Liberal seat in metropolitan Australia. The ALP would need a 22% swing to win it.
