2011 Copa América

The 2011 Copa América (also known as the 2011 Campeonato Sudamericano Copa América or Copa América 2011 Argentina) was the 43rd Copa América. The tournament was organized by CONMEBOL, which is the main association football body in South America. The tournament went from 1 July to 24 July 2011.

Uruguay won the tournament over Paraguay. Paraguay was known for going to the final without winning a single game. Because Uruguay won the tournament, they were allowed to play in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Peru finished at 3rd place after defeating Venezuela.

Japan and Mexico were both invited to the tournament. After some controversy that was brought up by UEFA, Mexico were only allowed to bring their Under-23 Olympic Team to the tournament.

People thought that Japan wouldn't be in the tournament because of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. However, Japan said that they will still be in the tournament. They decided to leave the tournament on 4 April 2011, because the games would get in the way of some J. League Division 1 matches. Even though Japan then decided to play in the tournament, and send some European-based players instead, they still decided to leave on May 16 because some European clubs didn't want to send their players away. On the next day, CONMEBOL sent a request to the North American team of Costa Rica, and Costa Rica then accepted the invite.
