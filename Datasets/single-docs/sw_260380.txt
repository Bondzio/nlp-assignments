John Bellamy Foster

John Bellamy Foster (born August 19, 1953) is editor of the independent socialist magazine "Monthly Review" and professor of sociology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. His writings have focused on political economy, environmental sociology, and Marxist theory. 

Foster's most recent book, "The Ecological Revolution: Making Peace with the Planet", examines the ecological crisis, and includes essays on global warming, peak oil, species extinction, world water shortages, global hunger, alternative energy sources, sustainable development, and environmental justice. Foster says that any attempt to solve our problems merely by technological, industrial or free market means, divorced from fundamental social relations, cannot succeed.
