Lake District

The Lake District, also known as The Lakes or Lakeland, is a rural area in north west England. It is a popular vacation area, famous for its lakes and its mountains and its associations with the early 19th century poetry and writings of William Wordsworth and the Lake Poets.

It is on a tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Lake District National Park (created in 1951) is one of the fifteen National parks in the United Kingdom.

The Lake District is about 34 miles (55Â km) across (north-to-south or west-to-east). It is entirely within Cumbria, and is one of England's few mountainous regions. All the land in England higher than three thousand feet above sea level is in the Park.

The word 'tarn' is a local word used to describe any small lake that may otherwise be called a pond.
