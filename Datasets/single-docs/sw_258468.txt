An Xbox 360 version is also available and was released on 31 October 2008 in the UK.

Gameplay styles vary on different platforms. In the Nintendo DS version, the characters have very large heads, giving the game a cartoonish, or chibi, feel. One of the DS screenshots show that Katara's ice bridge ability will return from the previous games. Sokka's boomerang is used to break hard to reach objects or to solve puzzles; it has been discovered (from the screenshots) that the player draws a path for the boomerang to follow. Toph can earthbend small platforms to get over gaps with spikes.

On the Wii version there's a totally new way to play. Fire, rocks and water can all be picked up by holidng the B button and are guided using the Wii remote provided there is a nearby source. Aang can form an "air ball" (sphere of high winds) to break down obstacles and blow away objects by making a circle with the Wii Remote. Toph can lift up Earth and throw it, pull earth out of walls and lift it up to make pillars. Katara can bend water to put out fires and can freeze it into a block by shaking the nunchuck. Ice can also be pulled out of water falls ice pillars can be made. Zuko can guide fire and burn things. Aang is unique, in that he can bend all four elements, although he only fights using Airbending. Sokka however throws his boomerang when the B button is pressed and uses the Wii remote to aim.
