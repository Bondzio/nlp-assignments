Doppler effect

Doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave. It is caused by the change in distance between the thing creating the wave (causer) and whatever is measuring seeing or hearing the wave (watcher or observer). It was first discovered by French scientist, Hippolyte Fizeau.

kkkkkkk word for "causer" is "sender". Another word for "change in distance" is "speed" or "relative velocity". 
A common example is sitting in a car while another car goes by the watcher. The watcher will hear a change in pitch, while the sender will not.

For waves read all the waves that can send out or reflected by an object. And for reflection read change of direction of a wave.

If observer and creator of the wave get closer, the frequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter.

If the distance between the observer and creator gets longer, the frequency is lower and the wavelength is longer.

Lightwaves can also be read, examples are:

An extreme example of the doppler effect is an airplane flying at a faster speed than the speed of sound and how the wall of sound is heard on the ground.
