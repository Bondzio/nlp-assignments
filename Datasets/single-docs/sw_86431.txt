Illuminati

The Illuminati (the “enlightened ones”) was a secret society. Adam Weishaupt, a philosopher and lawyer, started the society in 1776. In 1785 it was outlawed in Bavaria. 

Originally, they opposed superstition, prejudice, religious influence over public life, and abuses of state power. They supported women’s education and gender equality. 

Later, other groups formed using the same name. There is no evidence that these present-day groups have any significant power or influence. They promote themselves using the Bavarian Illuminati to attract membership.
