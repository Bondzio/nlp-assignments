International League

The International League (IL) is a minor league baseball league based in the Eastern United States. Like the Pacific Coast League and the Mexican League, the International League plays at the Triple-A level. It was so-named because it had teams in both the United States, Canada, and Cuba. However, all of the league's teams are now based in the U.S.
