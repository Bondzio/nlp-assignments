Revival meeting

A Revival meeting is an event organised by Christian missionaries. The purpose of the meeting is to inspire people to convert to Christianity or to raise funds for the church. The name means to bring "revival" (meaning to "reawaken") to a group or area. It is most common in American Protestant churches.
