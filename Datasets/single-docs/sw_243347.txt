2002 Commonwealth Games

The 2002 Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester, England from 25 July to 4 August 2002. The XVII Commonwealth Games was the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in England. It was larger than London's 1948 Summer Olympics in numbers of teams and athletes in the event.

After the 1996 Manchester bombing, the Games were part of the development of Manchester. It helped Manchester's reputation as a European Global City, and also, internationally. Rapid economic growth and continued urban rebuilding of the city continued after the Games. This helped make it one of the main cities in the United Kingdom.

Events were held across Greater Manchester. The opening and closing ceremonies, the athletic and the rugby sevens events were held at the City of Manchester Stadium. It was built for the Games. The shooting events were held in the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey. This was some from the main focus of the Games in Manchester. This is unusual for a large multi-sport event.

Seventy-two nations competed in 14 individual sports and 3 team sports events.
