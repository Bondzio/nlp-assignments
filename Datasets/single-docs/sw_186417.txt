Severance Hospital had a medical school called "Gwanghyewon" which opened in 1885. Therefore, Yonsei University states that it started in 1885.

The university offers courses in economics, business, and medical majors. Severance Hospital is still the medical center of Yonsei University. Yonsei University's school color is blue.
