The Entertainer (Alesha Dixon album)

The Entertainer is the third studio album by English recording artist Alesha Dixon. It was released on 26 November 2010 in the United Kingdom by Asylum Records. It was released by Atlantic Records in the United States. The album was originally called "Unleashed" but was renamed to "The Entertainer" instead. "The Entertainer" was the second album that Dixon used her first name instead of her full name. The first was 2006's "Fired Up". Dixon also rapped on some of the songs. The album has an American precision pop beat feel to it. It is a club record with the same kind of songs Britney and Lady GaGa love to sing.
