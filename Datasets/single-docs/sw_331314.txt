Part of Me

"Part of Me" is a song by American recording artist Katy Perry. The dance-pop and pop rock song was written by Perry, Bonnie McKee, Lukasz Gottwald, Max Martin while the production was done by Lukasz Gottwald and Cirkut. The song was released as the lead (seventh overall) single from the re-release of her album, "Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection". This song has been plagued with a range of leaks; in late 2010, the entire demo of the song leaked online, with music critics comparing the song to Perry's previous single "California Gurls" (2010). The lyrics were changed on the released version, prompting speculation that the lyrics were directed towards ex-husband Russell Brand, which Perry later denied. Following a performance on the 54th Grammy Awards, the song debuted at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
