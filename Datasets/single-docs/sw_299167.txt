Seychelles at the Olympics

Seychelles was first at the Olympic Games in 1980. They have been in most Summer Olympic Games since then, missing only the 1988 Games in support of North Korea. The nation has never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

As of 2011, no Seychellois athlete has won an Olympic medal.

The National Olympic Committee for Seychelles was created in 1979. They were recognized by the International Olympic Committee that same year.
