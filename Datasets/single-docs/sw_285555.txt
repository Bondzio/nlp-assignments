Atlantic Sun Conference

The Atlantic Sun Conference, branded since the 2016–17 school year as the ASUN Conference, is a NCAA conference whose members play in the NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Macon, Georgia and mostly features universities and colleges from the southeastern United States. The ASUN does not play football.

The ASUN began in 1978 as the Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC). It became the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2001.

As of the 2016–17 school year, the ASUN has eight full members, or schools that play almost all of their sports in the conference.

The most recent membership change came in July 2015, when Northern Kentucky University left the ASUN to join the Horizon League and was replaced by NJIT, which had previously been an independent (not in any conference).

NJIT joined the conference immediately in all ASUN sports that it sponsors except for men's soccer. That team continued to play in the Sun Belt Conference through the 2015 season because NJIT had a contract to play in that league through that time.

The ASUN will add a ninth full member in 2018 when the University of North Alabama joins from the NCAA Division II Gulf South Conference.

The ASUN also has seven "associate members" that play one or two sports in the conference while being full members of another conference. An eighth school will become an associate member in July 2017.
