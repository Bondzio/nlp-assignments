Second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson

The second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson as the 36th President of the United States was held on January 20, 1965.

The inauguration was the start of the second term (and first full four-year term) of Lyndon B. Johnson as President and the only term of Hubert Humphrey as Vice President. Chief Justice Earl Warren gave the Oath of office. Lady Bird Johnson started the tradition of First Ladies taking part in the event by holding the President's Bible.

About 1.2 million people attended the inauguration. At the time, that was the most people at any event held at the National Mall. This was the last time an inauguration was covered by newsreels.
