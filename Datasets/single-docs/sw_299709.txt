Kitchen stove

A kitchen stove, cooking stove, cookstove, or cooker is a kitchen appliance designed for cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven, used for baking.

Modern gas stoves were developed already in the 1820s, but these remained isolated experiments. At the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, a gas stove was shown, but only in the 1880s did this technology start to become a commercial success. The main factor in this delay was the slow growth of the gas pipe network.

There are still many traditional stoves made, which burn wood or solid fuel. The look and feel may be very similar to many traditional stoves, but the way fuel is burnt has evolved. Many also have back boilers for domestic heating.
