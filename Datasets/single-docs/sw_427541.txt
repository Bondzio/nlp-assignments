De Colores

De Colores is a common folk song in the Spanish-speaking world. Today, it is the anthem of the United Farm Workers movement.

No one knows for sure when the song first began to be sung in the Americas. The melody is thought to have been used in North and South America since the 16th century, having been brought over from Spain in the colonial era. However, the version of the lyrics sung today is thought to have been created by a group of Cursillo participants in Majorca, Spain, after one of the earliest Cursillo retreats in the 1940s.

Today, in addition to being used as the unofficial anthem of the United Farm Workers movement, and as an inspirational song in Cursillo workshops, the song is often taught in schools in the United States—from elementary school to community colleges—as an example of a common American folk song. It often appears in collections of children's songs.

"De colores" is usually sung in Spanish, but there are different English translations of the song. The song has also been translated into other languages. The lyrics depict an expression of joy and a celebration of all creation with its many bright colors. Below are four of the most commonly heard verses. Many additional verses (and variations of these verses) are known to exist, some including Christian references and some including more specific to farm life or labor union issues to be used as a rallying-song for farm-laborers. 
Spanish Version:
<poem>"     De colores, de colores
Se visten los campos en la primavera.
Son los pajaritos que vienen de afuera.
Es el arco iris que vemos lucir.

De muchos colores me gustan a mí.
De muchos colores me gustan a mí.

Brillantes y finos se viste la aurora.
Son los mil reflejos que el sol atesora.
Se viste el diamante que vemos lucir.

De muchos colores me gustan a mí.
De muchos colores me gustan a mí.

Con el quiri, quiri, quiri, quiri, quiri.
Con el cara, cara, cara, cara, cara.
Con el pío, pío, pío, pío, pí.

De muchos colores me gustan a mí.
De muchos colores me gustan a mí.

Vivamos en gracia puesto que se puede.
La sed ardorosa del Rey que no muere.
Llevemos a Cristo un alma y mil más.

La gracia divina del gran ideal.
La gracia divina del gran ideal.

Sí, de blanco y negro y rojo y azul y castaño.
De gente que ríe, y estrecha la mano.
De gente que sabe de la libertad.

De muchos colores me gustan a mí.
De muchos colores me gustan a mí."</poem>

English Version 
<poem>"     In colors, in colors
The fields are dressed in the spring.
Are the little birds that come from outside.
Is the rainbow that we see shining.

The great loves of many colors
The great loves of many colors.

Brilliant and delicate is dressed the dawn.
Are the thousand gleams the sun treasures.
Is dressed the diamond we see shining. 

The great loves of many colors.
The great loves of many colors.

The rooster sings, the rooster sings
With a cock-a-doodle, cock-a-doodle-doo.
With a cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck.
With a cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.

The great loves of many colors.
The great loves of many colors.

Let us live in grace since we can.
The burning thirst of the King who does not die.
Let us bring to Christ a soul and thousand more.

The divine grace from the great ideal.
The divine grace from the great ideal.

Yes, black and white and red and blue and brown.
From people laughing, and shaking hands.
From people who know freedom.

The great loves of many colors
The great loves of many colors."</poem>
