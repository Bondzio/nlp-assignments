National Governors Association

The National Governors Association (NGA) provides both state and national views regarding issues with usage of natural resources and management in the Progressive Era. It was founded in 1908 as the National Governors' Conference, at the Conference of Governors. The NGA represents the governors of the fifty U.S. states and five U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).

The NGA serves as an important public policy liaison between the state governments and the federal government.
