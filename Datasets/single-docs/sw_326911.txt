Nemuro Province

The boundaries of this ancient province are generally mirrored in what is today called Nemuro Subprefecture.

After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaido. Regional subdivisions were established. Nemuro Province was one of the new entities which were created in 1869.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Nemuro Province were reformed in the 1870s.

In 1882, Nemuro and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture.
