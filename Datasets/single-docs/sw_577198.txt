In a brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. 

Prior to joining the Bears, he played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks football team of the University of Kansas, where he compiled 4,020 all-purpose yards over three seasons and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American. 

Sayers was born in Wichita, Kansas. He was raised in Omaha, Nebraska. He studied at the University of Kansas. 

In 2012, Sayers was diagnosed with dementia after suffering multiple concussions during his football career.
