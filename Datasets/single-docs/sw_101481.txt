Book of Revelation

The Book of Revelation, which is sometimes called Revelation to John, Apocalypse of John, or Revelation of Jesus Christ is the last book of the New Testament in the Bible.

The last book of the New Testament is usually called the "Book of Revelation" or simply "Revelation". Some of the earliest manuscripts have the title of "The Revelation of John"(). Later manuscripts usually have the title of "The Revelation of the Theologian" (). This is why the Authorized King James Version calls Revelation the "Revelation of Saint John the Divine" ("divine" was a seventeenth century word for "theologian".

In Greek, the word "apocalypse" means "revealing" or "unveiling".

Some people consider Revelation to be the most difficult book in the Bible. Over the course of the book the author has two visions. There are many different ways to interpret these visions, and there have been many arguments over which way is right.

There is some disagreement over whether the John who wrote the letters of John, the John who wrote The Gospel of John, and the John who wrote the Book of Revelation are the same person. The person writing Revelation called himself "John". He also wrote that he was on Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea, when he saw his first vision.
