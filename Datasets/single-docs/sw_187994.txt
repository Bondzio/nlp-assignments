Pierre Schaeffer

Pierre Henri Marie Schaeffer (14 August 1910 – 19 August 1995) was a French musician and other things, like an inventor and engineer, and more. He was born in Nancy. He created a kind of music called musique concrète (which in the French speak means "concrete music"). This music was different from regular music, and had many sounds from things in the real world.

Schaeffer died of Alzheimer's disease in Aix-en-Provence.
