Proactivity

In behavioural psychology, proactivity is thinking ahead. It means doing things before they are needed. It also means preventing something before it happens. It means the same thing as "anticipation".

The term is often used in organizational behaviour. Proactive behaviour by individuals anticipates situations in the workplace. It means acting in advance of a situation, rather than just reacting afterwards. Proactive employees usually do not need to be asked to do something. They also do not need detailed instructions. Reactive employees are often controlled by the situation around them. In an unfamiliar situation they need instructions.
