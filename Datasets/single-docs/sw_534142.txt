Transantarctic Mountains

The Transantarctic Mountains are a mountain range in the continent of Antarctica. It divides the continent into eastern and western region. It extends for over 3200Â km.

The Antarctic Peninsula to the west is not part of this range.

Life in the interior of the Transantarctic Range is limited to bacteria, lichens, algae and fungi.

The name "Transantarctic Mountains" was first used in 1960, in a paper by geologist Warren Hamilton.
