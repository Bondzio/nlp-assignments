Ford Crown Victoria

The Ford Crown Victoria is a large, rear wheel powered automobile. It the last big, V-8, RWD sedan made by an American automobile company. In the 1980s, it was called the LTD Crown Victoria. Back then, it also came in a station wagon called the Country Squire. It has been widely used by both the general public as well as large businesses, government and law enforcement bodies. In 2008 Ford made the Crown Victoria "fleet-only", meaning they would no longer sell them one by one to the general public but could be obtained as used models. They are most commonly seen as police cars and taxis. The Crown Victoria also has the distinction of being the last car Ford sold with an analogue odometer when it was updated for the 2006 model year.
