Super Mario Bros. 2

Super Mario Bros. 2 is the second game of the "Mario" series. It is the name of two different games. In Japan, the game was created by Nintendo. Shigeru Miyamoto thought that the original "" was too hard for Americans, and decided to take a game called "", and replaced the old characters with the "Mario" characters Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad. The game was much different from other "Mario" games because of this.

This game features four characters: Toad, Luigi, Mario, and Princess Peach. Each one has different characteristics. Luigi can jump higher than the other characters, Peach can stay afloat for longer when jumping, Toad can pull items out of the ground quicker whilst Mario has generic all-round abilities.
Peach can stay afloat for a few seconds longer than the others.
The player can pick the character at the start of each level.

Unlike the regular "Mario" games, Mario and his friends have vegetables and can pick up some enemies and throw them.
