Motoori Norinaga

Motoori Norinaga (; 21 June 1730 â€“ 5 November 1801) was a Japanese scholar and poet during the Edo period. Norinaga's most important works include the "Kojiki-den" ("Commentaries on the Kojiki"), made over 35 years, and his comments on the "Tale of Genji".

Norinaga was born in what is now Matsusaka in Ise Province (now part of Mie Prefecture). At the age of 22, Norinaga went to Kyoto to study medicine. Although best known as a Kokugaku scholar, Norinaga spent 40 years as a practicing doctor in Matsusaka. 

He was the first to use the term Mono no aware, which is now an important concept in Japanese culture.
