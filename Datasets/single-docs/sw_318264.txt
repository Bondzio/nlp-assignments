V-1 flying bomb

The V-1 flying bomb (also called the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug) was a World War II weapon. It was a flying bomb that used a jet engine to make it travel at 350Â mph (600 kmph). The Luftwaffe people who controlled it pointed it at London, UK and Antwerp in Belgium. V-1s destroyed nearly as many houses as the Blitz did but killed fewer: 22,892 people died after being attacked by them. The Allies tried to stop these attacks by bombing their launching places, by shooting at them in the air, and by flying fast planes close to them and nudging them off course using their wings.

They had a fairly crude guidance system. Overall, only about 25 per cent of V-1s hit their targets. Most were lost lost by defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors.
