Shake-table

Shake-table in earthquake engineering is a very effective experimental equipment to verify seismic performance associated with the direct damage to individual buildings or their models under specified ground shaking. The best way to do it is to put a structure on a shake-table that simulates the earth shaking and to watch what may happen next (if you have no time to stand out in the field and wait for a real earthquake to strike). The earliest shake-table experiments were performed more than a century ago
