Defense mechanism

Defense mechanism is a psychological concept of the mind. It is the coping technique individuals unconsciously use to protect themselves from getting hurt in unpleasant situations (e.g. conflicts, unhappiness). Without defense mechanisms, people may suffer from psychological and mental illness.
