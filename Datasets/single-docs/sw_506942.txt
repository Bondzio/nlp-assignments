Wangen im Allgäu

Wangen im Allgäu is a city in south Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is north-east of the Lake Constance.

The city was first called "Wangun" in the year of 815. During the Middle Ages, the city growed a lot thanks to its location near many Alpine cities. The extra money that the city earned from its trade helped expand its borders.

In 1802, Wangen joined the Kingdom of Bavaria and lost its independence. Wangen was put into the Kingdom of Württemberg in 1810.

In 1936, the city was officially named "Wangen in Allgäu."

From 1938 to 1972, Wangen was the capital of the Wangen rural district. It then joined the Ravensburg district after the Wangen district broke up.

The city has been flooded a few times, most notably in 1999 and 2006.

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Togo national football team stayed in Wangen.

Wangen im Allgäu's climate is humid continental (Köppen: Dfb) with cold winters and warm summers.
