Function composition

In mathematics, function composition is a way to make a new function from two other functions.

If we let "f" be a function from "X" to "Y" and "g" be a function from "Y" to "Z" then we say that "g" composed with "f" is written as "g ∘ f" a function from "X" to "Z" (notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would it expect it to be as we will explain below).

The value of "f" given the input "x" is written as "f(x)". The value of "g ∘ f" given the input "x" is written "(g ∘ f)(x)" and is defined as "g(f(x))" (which means our way of writing "g" composed with "f" makes sense).

Here is another example. Let "f" be a function which doubles a number (multiplies it by 2) and let "g" be a function which subtracts 1 from a number.

These would be written as:

"g" composed with "f" would be the function which doubles a number and "then" subtracts 1 from it:

"f" composed with "g" would be the function which subtracts 1 from a number and "then" doubles it:

Function composition can be proven to be associative, which means:

Function composition is in general not commutative however, which means:

This can be seen in the first example where "(g ∘ f)(2) = 2*2 - 1 = 3" and "(f ∘ g)(2) = 2*(2-1) = 2".
