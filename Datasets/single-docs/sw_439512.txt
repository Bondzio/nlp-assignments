Cape Colony

The Cape Colony () was the name of a colony based around the Cape of Good Hope, in southern Africa. It was first established in 1652 by Jan van Riebeeck as a governorate of the Dutch East India Company. It was captured by the British in 1795 and returned to the Dutch in 1802. In 1806 it was again captured by the British. It united with three other British colonies in 1910 to form the Union of South Africa when it was renamed the "Cape Province". Its capital was Cape Town, the modern-day legislative capital of the Republic of South Africa.
