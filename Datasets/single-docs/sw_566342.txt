Justice for Sisters

Justice for Sisters is a non-profit organization that works for rights for transgender people in Malaysia. Nisha Ayub started the organization. The organization tries to repeal Malaysia's transgender laws. 

In 2014, Justice for Sisters went to court against the Sharia law. The Court of Appeals agreed with the organization, and said the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional. In 2015, the Federal Court reversed the court of Appeals.
