Governorates of Jordan

Jordan is divided into 12 governorates. In 1994, four new governorates were created: Jerash, Ajloun, Madaba and Aqaba.

The governorates of Jordan are in one of three regions: the North Region, Central Region and the South Region. The regions are mainly distributed by the distance between the cities.
