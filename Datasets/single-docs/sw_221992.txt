Century leap year

In the Gregorian calendar, a century leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 400 (and qualifies for the adding of February 29, like all other leap years). For example, the years 1600 and 2000 were century leap years; the century years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not century leap years. The next century leap year will occur in the year 2400. Century leap years always begin on a Saturday, and in such years February 29 always falls on a Tuesday.
