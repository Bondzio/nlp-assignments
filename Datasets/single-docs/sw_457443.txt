African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights

African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights is a treaty of international human rights law. It was adopted by the Organization of African Unity (today, African Union) on 27 July 1981. The preamble confirms the authority of the charter of the United Nations. It also confirms the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

The charter itself condemns apartheid, colonialism, neocolonialism and Zionism as violations of human rights. Unlike the European Convention on Human Rights, the charter confirms economic, social and cultural rights. These include the right to work, and civil rights. It also confirms the rights to self-determination, economic development, natural resources and to a good environment.
