List of Lords Provost of Dundee

The Lord Provost of Dundee is the chairman of the local authority of Dundee in Scotland. They are elected by the city council and serve not only as the chair of that body, but as a figurehead and Lord Lieutenant for the city. They are equivalent in many ways to the role of mayor that exists in other countries.

Each of the 32 Scottish local authorities elects a Provost. Only the four largest cities (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee) that have a Lord Provost. The current Lord Provost of Dundee is Robert James "Bob" Duncan (born 1946). Duncan took office on 21 May 2012.

The Mediaeval burgh of Dundee was administered by officials known as "Bailies", Provosts and the office of "Constable of Dundee". The office of Provost as the single chief official of the burgh was not created until the 1480s.
