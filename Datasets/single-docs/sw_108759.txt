WrestleMania XXV

WrestleMania XXV (or The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania or WrestleMania 25), was the twenty-fifth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling Pay-per-view produced by World Wrestling Entertainment and took place on April 5, 2009 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. It was the second WrestleMania held in the state of Texas, with the first being WrestleMania X-Seven, at the Reliant Astrodome, also in Houston, which was held in 2001. The tagline for the event was ""Everything is bigger in Texas, especially WrestleMania"." "Cowboy" by Kid Rock was used in the first promotional advertisement for the event. While WWE calls it the 25th Anniversary, it is only the 24th anniversary as WrestleMania I cannot be an anniversary of itself.

It was announced on January 30, 2009 that "War Machine" and "Shoot to Thrill", both by AC/DC, would be the theme songs for WrestleMania.

Since 1993, the winner of the yearly Royal Rumble match at the event of the PPV has won the opportunity to wrestle for a World Championship at WrestleMania. The only Royal Rumble winners since 1993 that did not wrestle for a championship at WrestleMania are Steve Austin in 1997, and Vince McMahon in 1999. Randy Orton won the match in 2009 and will wrestle for a championship at WrestleMania XXV.

On the February 16 edition of "Raw", Shawn Michaels challenged John "Bradshaw" Layfield to a match the following week for the right to face Undertaker at WrestleMania. Shawn won this match but was then forced to face Vladimir Kozlov for the right to face Undertaker at WrestleMania. Shawn won this match and will face The Undertaker at WrestleMania.

Money in the Bank (MITB) qualifying matches started on the February 23, 2009 edition of "Raw" with a triple threat match CM Punk versus John Morrison versus The Miz. CM Punk won the match and is the first of eight men to be added to the Money in the Bank ladder match.
