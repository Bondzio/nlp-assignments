Conservative Party (Empire of Brazil)

The Conservative Party was a Brazilian political party of the Imperial period, which was formed circa 1836 and was made extinct with the Proclamation of the Republic, in 1889. This party arose from the Restoration Party, which was a reunion of the old "Caramurus" and the dissident group of moderate liberals. The conservative party was also known as "regressist", being a counterpart to the Liberal Party, whose leader was Padre Feij√≥.
