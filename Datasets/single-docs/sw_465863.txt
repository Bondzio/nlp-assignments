News Corp

News Corp (officially "New News Corp; trading as News Corp") was founded in 2013. It is a spin-off from the former News Corporation which was founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979. 

It is an American multinational mass media company, based on newspapers and publishing. It is one of two companies which succeeded the former News Corporation. The other is 21st Century Fox, which has the old News Corporation's broadcasting and media properties, such as the Fox Entertainment Group. The spin-out was structured so that 21st Century Fox would be the legal successor and continuation of the old News Corporation, with the new News Corp being an entirely new company formed by a stock split.
