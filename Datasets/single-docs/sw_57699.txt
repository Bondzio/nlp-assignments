Bound for Glory

Bound for Glory is a Neo-Nazi thrash metal/Rock Against Communism band from Minnesota, USA. The band was formed in 1989. They are one of the best known and oldest bands of their genre in the United States.

In October 2016, Bound for Glory planned to play a concert in Falkirk, Scotland. A public outcry by the Scottish people, including anti-racist groups like Hope Not Hate, caused the event to be cancelled.
