Joule

A joule ( or sometimes ) is a unit in the SI system. That means that scientists use it. It measures energy; usually in scientific or electrical appliances . It is named after James Prescott Joule. 

A joule equals one newton multiplied by a meter (1J = 1N Ã— 1m). It is related to the watt (a unit of power): one watt equals one joule per second.

It is also the work done passing one amp through a resistance of one ohm for one second.
