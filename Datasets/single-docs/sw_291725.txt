Death of Baby P

Peter Connelly (1 March 2006 - 3 August 2007) (also known as "Baby P", "Child A" and "Baby Peter") was a 17-month-old baby who lived in the UK. Peter died of child abuse on 3 August 2007 in London after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period.

The case resulted in several big investigations into how the Social Services department of Haringey Council carried out its job looking after children in danger.
