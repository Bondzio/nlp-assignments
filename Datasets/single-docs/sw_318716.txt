X rating

Before the existence of the NC-17 rating, X rating was the original rating that represented no one 17 and under were allowed to any movie with this rating. The rating was not copyrighted, and that caused the rating to become tied to pornography, which in turn caused theaters to not take an X rated movie and in addition caused newspapers to not run ads for such movies. Certain movie companies had to release their films without rating, in particular independent movies. In Autumn 1990 the X was replaced with NC-17, but over the years, NC-17 absorbed exactly the same stigma that the X rating acquired earlier.
