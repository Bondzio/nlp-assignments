Unforgiven: In Your House

Unforgiven: In Your House was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on April 26, 1998 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was the 21st pay-per-view to be held under the WWF's In Your House name. The PPV was also the first to use the "scratch" logo for their promotional work, while WrestleMania XIV featured the logo on the ring apron, the official graphic still featured the New Generation logo. The pay-per-view also held the first ever Inferno Match and WWF's first evening gown match.
