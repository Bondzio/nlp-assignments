Indian Camp

Indian Camp is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway.

Nick Adams goes with his father, a doctor, to an Indian camp. A pregnant woman is having difficulty giving birth. The baby is found to be backwards in the womb, and Dr. Adams is forced to perform a Caesarean operation. After the procedure is successful, Nick's father looks on the top bunk of the bed to see if the woman's husband was okay. The man had committed suicide with a razor during the labor. 

This is the first Nick Adams story and shows the characterization of the father/son relationship between Nick and Dr. Adams.
