Right Behind You (Mafia)

"'Right Behind You (Mafia)'" is a 2001 alternative rock/post-grunge song by the Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace and is the third single from their fourth studio album "Spiritual Machines", which was released in 2000. The song was written by Raine Maida and Mike Turner and was produced by both Arnold Lanni and Raine Maida.

The song was inspired by Ray Kurzweil's book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, and was written as more of a retort to Kurzweil's predictions which Raine noticed didn't involve the human spirit as a factor.
