Absolute value

In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus of a real number is the number without the sign. The absolute value of "2" is "2", the absolute value of "-2" is also 2. This notation is to express a number's distance from zero on a number line. The absolute value of 10 would be 10 since the number 10 is 10 numbers away from zero, same follows with negatives.

The modulus of a complex number is given by 
For any real number  the absolute value of  is denoted by (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity) and is defined as

The absolute value of  is always either positive or zero, but never negative.
From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line. The absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them.

In calculus, the absolute value function is differentiable except at 0. It is everywhere continuous.

Compare the norm of a vector.

The square-root notation without sign represents the "positive" square root. So, it follows that

which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value.

The absolute value has the following four main properties:

Other important properties of the absolute value include:

Two other useful properties concerning inequalities are:

These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:

For a complex number formula_6, where x is the real part of z and iy is the imaginary part of z,
