SAT

The SAT Reasoning Test (used to be called Scholastic Aptitude Test and Scholastic Assessment Test) is a test for college admissions in the United States. The SAT is owned, published, and created by the College Board, a non-profit organization in the United States, and was once owned by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). ETS now administers the exam.

The test tests students (usually high school seniors) in three areas: Critical Reading, Mathematics, and Writing. The newest section is Writing, introduced in 2005, with a new essay section. The scores in each area go from 200 to 800, 800 being the best score. The scores in the three areas are added up, for a score between 600 and 2400. The average score is about 1500 in total. On the old SAT administered before 2005, the top score was 1600. Getting near the highest or lowest scores is rare.

The test has ten sections, with the essay always coming first. There is also a section that is not scored. College Board says:

The sections are mostly 25 minutes long, but the later sections start to get shorter, with fewer questions. The whole test lasts 3 hours and 45 minutes.

The PSAT is also fee-based, and is practice for the real SAT. The SAT Subject Tests are not to be confused with the SAT.

The NMSQT is the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. It's a qualifying test for the National Merit Scholarship Program.
