Golden Fleece

In Greek mythology, the Golden Fleece is the fleece of the gold-haired winged ram. It is in the story of Jason and his group of Argonauts. They set out on a quest ordered by King Pelias to get the fleece so that Jason can rightfully claim the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly. The story is very old; it was current in the time of Homer in the 8th century BC. There are many different versions of the story. In later versions the ram is said to have been the child of the sea god Poseidon and Themisto (less often, Nephele or Theophane). The famous telling is the "Argonautica" of Apollonius of Rhodes, written in mid-third century BC Alexandria. It reused early sources that have not survived. Another, much less-known Argonautica, using the same body of myth, was written in Latin by Valerius Flaccus during the time of Vespasian.The story of Jason, the Argonauts, and the Golden Fleece is told in two modern movies: "Hercules" starring Steve Reeves, and "Jason and the Argonauts" starring Todd Armstrong.
