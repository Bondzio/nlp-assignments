Alligator Records

Alligator Records is an independent blues record label from Chicago, Illinois, USA. It was founded by Bruce Iglauer in 1971. For his work maintaining Chicago Blues Iglauer was honoured "Chicagoans-of-the-Year 2001"
Alligator Records was founded to publish an album by Hound Dog Taylor & The HouseRockers, his favourite band. His employer, Bob Koester of Delmark Records refused to do so, therefore Iglauer decided to make his own record label.

Since its beginning Alligator Records has published over 250 Blues- und Bluesrockalbums.
