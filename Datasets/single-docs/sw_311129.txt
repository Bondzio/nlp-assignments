During his early career in open wheel racing, Wheldon had a rivalry with Jenson Button before he left the United Kingdom to start racing in America. Wheldon moved to America because he thought the potential for success in America were greater than in the UK. Wheldon moved to the United States in 1999. He spent many years racing in lower open-wheeled circuits like the U.S. F2000 Championship Series, the Toyota Atlantic series and the Indy Lights series before moving to a higher series.

He drove for Panther Racing with his teammate Sam Hornish, Jr. In 2003 Wheldon joined Andretti Green Racing, winning the Rookie of the Year award.

Wheldon began the 2006 IndyCar season by winning the race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. This was a somber race, as Paul Dana had died earlier while practicing for the race. At the end of the 2006 IndyCar season Wheldon and Sam Hornish, Jr. were tied for the lead in the points. They both had 475 points. Hornish had four wins for the 2006 season, and Wheldon only had two. Because Hornish had more wins then Wheldon, he was made the 2006 Indy Car Champion.

The BMW Sauber Formula One team offered to let Wheldon drive for them, but he declined their offer. They could not give Wheldon a ride for the whole season, so he decided to continue to focus on Indy.
