Sandpit

A sandbox or sandpit is a small area filled with sand made for children to play in. Sandboxes are often square with wooden sides. They can be found in many playgrounds, and can also be installed in the gardens of homes. Sandpits are also very popular for making sandcastles. However, some animals use them for litter trays. Sandboxes can be found in most elementary schools. They can also be made of plastic, and in different shapes. They are mostly made for the purpose of entertaining young children.
