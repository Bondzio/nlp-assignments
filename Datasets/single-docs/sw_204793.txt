Molar conductivity

Molar conductivity is a scientific term. The molar conductivity of an electrolyte is a measure of how well it conducts electricity in solution. It is calculated by dividing the conductivity (how well the electrolyte conducts electricity) by the molar concentration (how much the electrolyte is diluted: a solution means that it has been dissolved in something else: see solution). It is measured in siemens per metre per molarity. The symbol for molar conductivity is Λ, or Λm.
