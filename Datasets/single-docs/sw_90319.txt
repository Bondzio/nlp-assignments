Eunuch

A eunuch is a castrated man. His genitals have been removed. This can be cutting off the testicles or removing the penis and the testicles.

Over the millennia since, eunuchs had a lot of different functions in different cultures such as domestics, treble singers, religious specialists, government officials, military commanders, and guardians of women or harem servants. When eunuchs ran a harem, a monarch could be sure he was the one who fathered his wives' children since real eunuchs were always infertile.
