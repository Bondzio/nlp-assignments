W (New York City Subway)

The W Broadway Local is a rapid transit service of the New York City Subway's B Division. Its route emblem, or "bullet", is colored sunflower yellow because it is used on the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan. In addition to the Broadway Line, the W serves the BMT Astoria Line in Queens. This uses the 60th Street Tunnel to travel under the East River between Queens and Manhattan. It also ran in Brooklyn until 2004, serving the BMT Fourth Avenue and West End lines. The W is in service as of November 7, 2016. There was a six year delay due to Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA, budget cuts on June 25, 2010.
