Leucippus

Leucippus or Leukippos (, first half of 5th century BC) was among the earliest philosophers of atomism, the idea that everything is made up of many imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. He was born at Miletus or Abdera 

Leucippus apparently was the first person to suggest the idea of empty space. We would call this vacuum, and he believed that the different atoms had different sizes and weights.
