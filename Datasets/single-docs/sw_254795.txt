Bircham International University

Bircham International University is a private independent institution of higher education via distance education. It offers adult degree programs at professional, undergraduate and graduate levels. It is registered in Spain and Delaware. In the past it operated from the Bahamas or the United Kingdom. It has no recognized educational accreditation in any of these places. 

Bircham is not accredited by any accreditation agency recognized by United States authorities. It is listed as a member of the European Foundation for Quality in eLearning, a membership organization that does not engage in educational accreditation. It also is listed as a member of the International Accreditation and Recognition Council, an unrecognized accreditation agency in the United States. Bircham states that it was accredited by the American Association for Higher Education and Accreditation in 2010. This organization is not a recognized accreditation body.

Because Bircham is not accredited by a recognized accreditor in the countries where it operates, employers or other institutions might not accept Bircham's degrees and credits.
