Old-growth forest

Old-growth forest (also called primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or in Britain, ancient woodland) is a forest that has reached a great age without much disturbance.

It has unique ecological features, and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include various tree-related structures. These provide wildlife habitats which increase the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem.

Usually old-growth forests have multi-layered open canopies. They also include varied tree heights and diameters with fallen logs on the forest floor. In Europe less than 7% of forests are old-growth, mainly due to industrial logging in the 20th century. In the United States estimates are that only 10% of old-growth forests remain. In Asia old-growth forests are sometimes lost in regional conflicts.
