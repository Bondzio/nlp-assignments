Bear dog

The Amphicyonidae or bear dogs, is an extinct family of large terrestrial carnivores.

They belonged to the dog-like suborder Caniformia. It had a wide distribution in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. They lived from the Eocene epoch to the Pleistocene epoch 46.2 1.8 million years ago (mya), for a total of about 44.4 million years.

Originally they evolved in the Old World, but crossed over to the Americas during the Miocene epoch. This would happen at a time when crossing was possible via the Bering Strait.
