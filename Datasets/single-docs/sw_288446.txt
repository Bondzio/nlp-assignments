San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station

San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) is one of the largest nuclear generating stations in the U.S. It is at the north of San Diego County, California. It has two active 1,100-megawatt units. It began operation in 1968. 

SONGS is the regionâ€™s largest power source with 2,200 megawatts of output. That is enough power for 1.4 million average Southern California homes.

The station is built to withstand a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. A geological fault that might cause a tsunami and threaten the plant is about 5 miles offshore.
