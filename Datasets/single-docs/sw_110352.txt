Charles (Chuck) Wendell Colson (born October 16, 1931, in Boston, Massachusetts; died April 21, 2012) was the chief counsel for President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1973. Colson was also a public speaker and author.

In 1969 Colson was appointed Special counsel to the White House. President Richard Nixon quickly noticed him. In 1970 Nixon put Colson in charge of "dirty tricks" (performed against Nixon's opponents). He was a part of the Watergate scandal. He was the first of the Nixon White House assistants to be convicted of a crime.
