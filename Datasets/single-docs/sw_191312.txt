Blanquette de Limoux

Blanquette de Limoux is the name given to a number of sparkling wines from the Languedoc, in France. It is probably the oldest known sparkling wine in France. According to a text at a local abbey, Livy praised the wines from Limoux, which weren't sparkling wines, at the time. Benedictine monks of the abbey of Saint Hilaire found out how to make sparkling wine from white wine. Dom PÃ©rignon brought back the method of making sparkling wines to his abbey in Champagne, at the end of the 16th century. He started to experiment with it in the vineyards of the abbey.
