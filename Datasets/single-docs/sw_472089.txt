Gershon Kingsley

Gershon Kingsley (born GÃ¶tz Gustav Ksinski; October 28, 1922 in Bochum, Germany) is a German-American composer. His music genre included electronic music and the Moog synthesizer. He was the founder of the First Moog Quartet, as a partner in the electronic music duo Perrey and Kingsley, and writer of rock-inspired compositions for Jewish religious ceremonies.

Because of his Jewish background (his father was Jewish), he moved to Mandatory Palestine in 1938. After the war he moved to the United States.
