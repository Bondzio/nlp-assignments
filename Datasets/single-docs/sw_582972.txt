Edgar Morin

Edgar Morin (; born Edgar Nahoum on 8 July 1921) is a French philosopher and sociologist. He has been known for his work on complexity and "complex thought," and for his scholarly contributions to such diverse fields as media studies, politics, sociology, visual anthropology, ecology, education, and systems biology. 

Morin holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.
