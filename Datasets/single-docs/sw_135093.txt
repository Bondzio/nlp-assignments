Weightlifting

Weightlifting first started in the so-called Dark Ages of the human history. It was usually done by the strongest men in villages all over Europe. It was considered to be a sport for the lower classes, however since then it has changed into the sport for other people as well. It has been in the Olympic Games since 1896.

As a competitive sport, Weightlifting is controlled by the "International Weightlifting Federation" (IWF). Based in Budapest, it was founded in 1905.

The "snatch" is one of the two olympic weightlifting events. The essence of the event is to lift a barbell from the platform to locked arms overhead in a smooth continuous movement. The lift requires not only great strength, but mastery of technical skills, a high degree of shoulder flexibility, excellent balance, and speed.

The "clean and jerk" is another olympic weightlifting events. It is a highly technical lift that is known as "the king of lifts" because more weight can be lifted above one's head as compared to any other known weightlifting technique.
