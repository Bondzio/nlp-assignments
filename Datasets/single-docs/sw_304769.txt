Saudi Arabia at the Olympics

Saudi Arabia has been in eight Summer Olympic Games. They first were in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. They have never been in the Winter Olympic Games. 

By Saudi Arabian law, women cannot be in the Olympic Games. However, the International Olympic Committee is reportedly pressuring the Saudi Olympic Committee to send female athletes to the 2012 Summer Olympics. Others want Saudi Arabia to not be in the Olympics unless they let women in. 

The Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee was formed in 1964 and recognized in 1965.
