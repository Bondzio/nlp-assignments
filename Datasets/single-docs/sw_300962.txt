Handstand

A handstand is the act of holding the body upside down balancing on the hands. The body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended. The hands are placed about shoulder-width apart. A handstand performer must have balance and upper body strength.

Handstands are used in many activities, including acro dance, acrobatics, cheerleading and gymnastics. Some type of handstand is performed on all gymnastic equipment. Many tumbling skills pass through a handstand position as part of the action. Breakdancers use handstands in freezes and kicks. Sometimes a handstand is used as a starting position for diving. In games or contests, swimmers will sometimes do underwater handstands on pool bottoms with legs and feet extended above the water.

Handstands are known by various other names. In yoga, the handstand is known as "Adho Mukha Vrksasana" (pronounced AHD-hoh MOOK-hah vrik-SHAH-sah-nah) translating to Downward-facing Tree Pose, and in capoeira it is named bananeira.

There are two basic handstands used in modern gymnastics: "curved-back" and "straight-back". Straight-back style is used when straight body lines are wanted and possible. In many cases the curved-back style is better as it has much better control over balance. Balance is kept by shifting body weight towards the fingers or the heel of the hand.
