Studio Ghibli

Studio Ghibli was established by Hayao Miyazaki in 1985. The name comes from the Arabic word "ghibli", for hot winds blowing from the Sahara Desert.

The main focus of Ghibli is to produce long animations, but they have produced short animations since the middle of 1990. Their movies often satirize the society at that time.

The Studio Ghibli tends to choose famous actors from television or movies as their voice actors.

The Ghibli Museum is in Mitaka.
