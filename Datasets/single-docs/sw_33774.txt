Psychiatric hospital

A psychiatric hospital is a place where mentally ill people are kept, sometimes until doctors are ready to place them into halfway houses, where they are slowly released into society. Group homes are open to people when they are released from a psychiatric hospital.
Usually people choose to be in a psychiatric hospital. Sometimes psychiatrists decide to put people in hospitals who do not want to be there, because they think the people are dangerous to themselves or other people.

Psychiatric hospitals used to be called lunatic asylums.
