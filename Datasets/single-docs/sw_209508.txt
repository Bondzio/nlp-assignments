Brian Jones

Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones (28 February 1942 â€“ 3 July 1969) was an English musician. He is best known as one of the founding members of the rock band The Rolling Stones. Jones was known for his ability to play multiple instruments including: guitar, harmonica, piano, organ, mellotron, sitar, recorder, saxophone, drums and marimba as well as many others. He was also well known for his drug and alcohol abuse which led to him being fired from the Rolling Stones on 8 June 1969. Just after midnight on 3 July 1969 Jones was discovered dead at the bottom of his swimming pool at his home in Sussex, England. The details surrounding his death were controversial and Jones' girlfriend claimed he was murdered. However the coroner's official report stated that Jones had drowned and declared the incident a "death by misadventure." The coroner noted that his liver and heart were greatly enlarged by his long-term drug and alcohol abuse.
