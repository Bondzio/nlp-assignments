New York and New Jersey Campaign

The New York and New Jersey Campaign was a series of battles between the British forces and the Continental Army that decided who would take control of New York City and the U.S. state of New Jersey in the American Revolutionary War and were mostly British victories. One British purpose was to finish smashing the Rebel army after the Battle of Long Island. The battles happened mainly in the winter months of 1776 and 1777. The Continentals won the two small battles of Trenton and Princeton at the end of the campaign, but the British controlled the area for most of the rest of the war.
