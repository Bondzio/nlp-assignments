John Napier Wyndham Turner, PC, CC, QC (born June 7, 1929) is a former politician who served as the 17th Prime Minister of Canada from June 30 to September 17, 1984. He was the leader of the Liberal Party. He was born in Surrey, England. He and his mother moved to British Columbia in 1932 when his father died.

Turner was elected as a member of Parliament in 1962. He held several positions in Cabinet, including minister of justice and minister of finance under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1968 to 1975. He resigned his ministry in 1975, and took a break from politics until 1984. During this time, he worked as a lawyer in Toronto. In 1984, Turner returned and successfully ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Turner held the office of Prime Minister for just 79 days. Immediately after being sworn in as Prime Minister, he dissolved Parliament and called for new elections. He lost that election by a wide margin.
