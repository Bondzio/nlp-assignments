Renee Paquette

Renee Paquette (born September 19, 1984) is a Canadian sports broadcaster. She is currently working with the WWE where she is known under the ring name Renee Young and does interviewing as well as commentating duties. Paquette first worked as a sportscaster for The Score, known now as Sportsnet 360.

She was born in Ajax, Ontario. She grew up in both Ajax and Whitby, Ontario. She grew up as a WWE fan. When she was asked about it, she answered: "I was. I attended a few events and WrestleMania VI. My dad is a concert promoter and he’d get me into the events. I remember being backstage and meeting “Stone Cold” [Steve Austin], Triple H, Chyna and Trish [Stratus] as a kid, so it’s really funny to me that I ended up here. I went on a different path than wanting to become a WWE Superstar. I have a broadcasting and performance background."

She started her career by working with The Score. While there, she worked on a programme called "Right After Wrestling", later renamed "Aftermath" with Arda Ocal and former WWE referee Jimmy Korderas.

In October 2012, Paquette signed with the WWE and was renamed under the ring name Renee Young. She made her on-screen debut on the March 29, 2013 episode of "SmackDown" where she interviewed Randy Orton, Big Show and Sheamus. She made her commentary debut on "NXT" in September 2013. She is also a presenter on "The JBL and Cole Show" and hosts "WWE Vintage Collection" alongside WWE Hall of Famer Mean Gene Okerlund. 

Renee is currently in a relationship with the WWE Superstar Dean Ambrose (former member of The Shield).
