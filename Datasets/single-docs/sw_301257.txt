Protura

The Protura, or proturans, and sometimes nicknamed coneheads are an order of hexapod animals previously regarded as insects, and sometimes treated as a class in their own right. There is some evidence that the Protura are basal to all other hexapods, although hexapods are increasingly thought to be polyphyletic.
