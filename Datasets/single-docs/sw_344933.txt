Xenon difluoride

Xenon difluoride is a chemical compound with the formula XeF. This noble gas compound can be used as a good fluorinating agent. Xenon diflouride is the most stable compound of all xenon compounds.

The compound shows a trigonal bipyramidal pseudostructure or a linear real structure in VSEPR theory.

Xenon diflouride is solid in state of matter. It is achromatic (without color) and in crystal form. Under high pressure and temperature, the compound can be produced from xenon and flourine directly.

Xenon diflouride is used in organic syntheses as flourinating agent.

Xenon diflouride can be destroyed by heating. It then results in the pure substances flourine and xenon. This reactions happens explosively, even though that the enthalpy of reaction is negative (formula_2). That is because the reaction changes the state of matter from solid to gas. The gas needs more space in room.
