Bank and Monument stations

Bank and Monument are interlinked stations, officially one station known operationally as the "Bank-Monument complex". However, separate names are used on station entrances, platforms and the tube map. The complex spans the length of King William Street in the City of London. Together they form the eighth busiest station on the network, being served by five London Underground lines and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). 
The two parts of the combined station take their names from the nearby Bank of England and the Monument to the Great Fire of London. The complex is in Travelcard Zone 1.

London Buses routes 8, 11, 21, 23, 25, 26, 40, 43, 76, 133, 141, 242 and 388 and night bus routes N8, N11, N21, N26, N76, N133, N550 and N551 serve the station.
