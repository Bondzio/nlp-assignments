1138 Aleppo earthquake

The 1138 Aleppo earthquake happened near the town of Aleppo in northern Syria on 11 October 1138. The United States Geological Survey lists it as the third deadliest earthquake in history with 230,000 people killed. However, the number of dead comes from a combination of this earthquake with earthquakes in November 1137 on the Jazira plain and 30 September 1139 in Ganja, Azerbaijan in historical records. Ibn Taghribirdi first wrote about the large number of dead in the fifteenth century.
