Saint-Gilles, Belgium

Saint-Gilles (in French) or Sint-Gillis (in Dutch) is one of the nineteen municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium.

In 1830, Brussels became the capital of newly founded Belgium. As a result, the rural village of Saint-Gilles went through a big growth. The population went from 2,500 around 1800 to more than 33,000 in 1880 to a peak of 60,000 in 1910.

The pattern of the streets was completely remodeled in the 1860s by architect and urbanist Victor Besme. These were the years when the Louise Avenue, the Brussels-South railway station, and the new Saint Giles church were built. They were soon followed by the new jail and city hall. Today, Saint-Gilles is one of the densest municipalities of the Brussels agglomeration.


The local council usually has a socialist majority. The mayor as of 2012 is Charles Picqu√©. He is also Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region.
