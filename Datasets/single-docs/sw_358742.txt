Second derivative

In physics and mathematics, the second derivative is the derivative of the derivative of a function, say formula_1. The second derivative has many real-life applications, especially in the study of acceleration. Second derivatives can be notated in several ways, some of which are

Other notations are used, but the above two are the most commonly used.

If we have a function formula_4, then the second derivative of the function can be found using the power rule for second derivatives
