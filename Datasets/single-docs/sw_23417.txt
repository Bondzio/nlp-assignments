Senkaku Islands

Senkaku Islands, also called , Diaoyu Dao Islands () and Diaoyutai Islands (), are uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.

The group of islands, islets and rocks is east of mainland China, northeast of Taiwan, west of Okinawa, and north of the southwestern end of the Ryukyu Islands. The islands are about 200km from Taiwan, and about 300 km from Okinawa.

Control over these islands and rocks is disputed. The dispute issues are complex. 
The Japanese government describes the islands as part of Japan. 

The islands are also described as part of China. There are conflicts in the positions of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC). The PRC and ROC have a shared history. 

The United States occupied the islands from 1945 to 1972 when they reverted to Japan. The official US position is neutral in a dispute among Japan, China and Taiwan.
