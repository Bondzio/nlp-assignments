Chaohusaurus

Chaohusaurus is an extinct genus of basal ichthyopterygian, or ichthyosaur, from the Lower Triassic of Chaohu and Yuanan, China. 

It was closer in time and form to "Cymbospondylus" and "Mixosaurus" than to more advanced genera like "Ichthyosaurus". It did not have the dolphin-like form of later ichthyosaurs, but it was fully aquatic. The tail fin is wide-based and short. The neck is rather long, whereas later ichthyosaurs have no neck. There is no dorsal fin.

It was one of the smallest ichthyosaurs, about 70 to 180 cm long. Its weight was about 10 kg.

A recent study of "Chaohusaurus" shows an early example of live birth. A remarkable feature was a baby close to emerging "head-first". The authors comment:

In other words, ichthyosaurs gave live birth when they were still land dwellers. Then, later, they adapted to an aquatic life.
