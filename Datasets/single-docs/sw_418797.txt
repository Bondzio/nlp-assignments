Food court

A food court, also called a food hall, is an area inside of a building which has a number of different restaurants and snack bars located around a single area where people sit at. Food courts may be found in shopping malls, airports, and parks. They may also be found in high schools and universities, where they replace or are additions to normal cafeterias.
