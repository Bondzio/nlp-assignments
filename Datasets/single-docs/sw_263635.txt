Potassium manganate

Potassium manganate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KMnO. It contains potassium and manganate ions.

Potassium manganate is a green solid. It can disproportionate into potassium permanganate and manganese(IV) oxide. This happens in acidic pH. This reaction, because of its color change, is known as a "chemical chameleon".

It is made by reacting manganese(IV) oxide with very hot potassium hydroxide. Sometimes oxygen or potassium nitrate is used as the oxidizing agent. This makes potassium manganate. Normally the potassium manganate is converted to potassium permanganate. Potassium permanganate is more common. Potassium iodide can reduce potassium permanganate to potassium manganate. It can also be made by reacting hot potassium permanganate with potassium hydroxide. This makes oxygen and potassium manganate.

Potassium manganate does not have many uses. It is mainly made when potassium permanganate is made.

Potassium manganate is a moderate oxidizing agent. When it is reduced, it can made black or brown stains on glass, clothing, or skin.
