Autofellatio

Autofellatio is an act of masturbation where a man sucks or licks his own penis.

Only men who have enough flexibility, penis size or both can perform autofellatio. Autofellatio is a niche in pornography. In some animals, like the Cape ground squirrel, scientists have seen these animals doing autofellatio and also manual masturbation.

According to historians, autofellatio in Ancient Egypt had religious meaning.
