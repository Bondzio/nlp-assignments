NBA G League

The NBA G League, or Gatorade League, is the National Basketball Association's officially sponsored and operated developmental basketball organization. When the league was formed in 2001, it was called the National Basketball Development League (NBDL). In 2005, it entered into a formal relationship with the NBA and became the NBA Development League, or D-League. After the 2016â€“17 season, the NBA entered a sponsorship deal with PepsiCo's Gatorade brand of sports drinks; the league first called itself the "Gatorade League", but settled on "G League", reflecting Gatorade's use of a single large "G" as its brand logo.
