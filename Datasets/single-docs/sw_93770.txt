Prophets of Islam

Prophets of Islam are human beings who are regarded by Muslims to be prophets chosen by God. All prophets preached the same message.

There are 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an. These are:

Muslims believe in other prophets other than those mentioned by name in the Qur'an as there are many verses in the Qur'an which speak about it. These other prophets include: Joshua, Luqman, Caleb, Seth, Daniel, Isaiah, Hosea, Jeremiah, Shem, Benjamin, Khidr, Dhul Qurnayn.

The prophets were sent on this Earth for a purpose. That was to call every one towards the one who created the entire creation. To call everyone towards the one who hears all. The one who sees all. The one who forgives. The most important message was to worship Allah SWT alone and to follow his teachings. All of them, Adam AS, Nuh AS, Ibrahim AS, Ishaaq AS, Ismail AS, Musa AS, Haarun AS, Dawood AS, Sulaymaan AS, Isa AS, Muhammad SAW and others invited people to worship Allah SWT alone and not to pray to idols and other false gods. They told us that showing humanity the right path that will lead them to paradise and to salvation from hell-fire. All the prophets were an example to lead moral, righteous, purpose driven lives free of doubts and confusions. Human beings follow their role models, so the best examples of righteousness for humans to imitate are those of Allah SWTâ€™s prophets that he sent down to Earth.
