Joy of Giving Week

The Joy of Giving Week (JGW), planned for Sept 27 - Oct 3, 2009 as a national movement, aims at engaging at least one crore Indians in different ""acts of giving"" - "money, time, resources and skills"- spanning the corporate, NGO and government sectors, schools, colleges and the general public. The idea is to create a ""festival of philanthropy"" that can, over the years, become a part of the Indian ethos, with the Week being celebrated every year covering Gandhi Jayanti. The Week is designed as a ""public platform"" and is being co-ordinated by GiveIndia, a non for profit organization whose mission is to promote "Giving". GiveIndia has earlier initiated public giving activities like the Mumbai and Delhi marathons and runs the largest Payroll Giving programme in the country across 40 companies.

The "Joy of Giving Week" was launched in Mumbai on June 3 in front of the media and was covered by 22 news channels and over 40 publications and a press meet was scheduled in Chennai on June 30. And soon, the campaign would launched before media in Hyderabad and various other cities.

Several corporates, celebrities and organisations have already finalized their efforts towards awareness, volunteering and fundraising events that they will organize during the "Joy of Giving Week".
