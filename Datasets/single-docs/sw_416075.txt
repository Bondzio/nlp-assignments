Stormtrooper (Star Wars)

In the fictional Star Wars universe, Stormtroopers are highly trained soldiers working for the evil Emperor and his sidekick Darth Vader. They wear white armor and helmets, and use blaster guns.

Some of the Stormtroopers are clones (copies) of a man named Boba Fett. These clones used to be on the side of the good guys, but after being told by the Emperor to kill all the Jedi, they did, and afterwards became Stormtroopers. Regular men became Stormtroopers too.
