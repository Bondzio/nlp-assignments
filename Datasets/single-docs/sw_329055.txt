Water Music (Handel)

The Water Music is a group of pieces for Baroque orchestra. The pieces were composed by George Frideric Handel. The "Water Music" is made up of three suites. These suites include minuets, hornpipes, bourr√©es, and other dances. In sum, there are three suites (F major, D major, G major), made up of 21 individual pieces. 

Legend says the three suites were first played on a trip taken by King George I of England up the Thames to Chelsea or Lambeth on 17 July 1717. The King had known Handel for a long time. For some reason though, he was angry with Handel. The "Water Music" was Handel's way of appeasing the King. Fifty musicians floated alongside the King's barge playing the suites. The King was so pleased he ordered "Water Music" played three times.

All the instruments in the Baroque orchestra were included in the composition, except the harpsichord and timpani. It would have been difficult to bring these instruments aboard a barge. The instruments in a complete performance are a flute, two oboes, one bassoon, two horns, two trumpets, strings, and continuo.
