Shikata ga nai

If something happens which is beyond someone's ability to control or affect, a conventional Japanese reaction is to say "shikata ga nai". With this phrase, someone recognizes that a problem exists and then gets on with doing what can be done. 

The phrase is another way to say that it's useless to try to do something.

After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, "shoganai" was one of the most commonly heard expressions.
