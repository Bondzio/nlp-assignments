Paedophile Information Exchange

The Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) was a UK pro-paedophile activist group. It started in October 1974. In 1975 PIE had their first open meeting. Mothers threw rotten fruit and vegetables at members. That year the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) gave PIE affiliate status.
