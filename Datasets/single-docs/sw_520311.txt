Right to a fair trial

The right to fair trial is an essential right in all countries respecting the rule of law. A trial in these countries that is considered unfair will typically be restarted, or its verdict voided. Various rights associated with a fair trial are explicitly proclaimed in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They are clearly stated in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They are also stated in Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the world. There is no binding international law that defines what is or is not a fair trial. For example, the right to a jury trial and other important procedures vary from nation to nation.
