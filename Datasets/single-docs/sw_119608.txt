Evangelical Church in Germany

The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany (German: Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland) is a series of 20 regional churches. The 20 are made up of two Reformed (Calvinist), 9 Lutheran and 9 United (Lutheran-Reformed) churches. 

The Moravian Church and the Federation of Evangelical Reformed Congregations are associate members.

The Evangelical Church in Germany is not a church like the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. This is because it is not one big church which share the same system of beliefs, instead it is a collection of churches which allow its members to share in church services and worship.
