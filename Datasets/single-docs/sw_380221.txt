Ricegrowers Limited

Ricegrowers Limited, trading as SunRice, is claimed to be the "world's fifth largest ricefood exporter", and have historically been one of Australia's largest exporters of processed branded food products.

SunRice's main production is still based in regional New South Wales, Australia, with a main office in Leeton, and Rice Mills in the New South Wales towns of Leeton, Deniliquin, and Coleambally (with the Coleambally mill operational again after being temporarily "moth balled" during the last major Australian drought). RunRice also operates CopRice stockfeed plants in Leeton and Tongala, Victoria.

SunRice have recently named triple Olympic gold medallist Stephanie Rice as brand ambassador.

In October 2010 SunRice announced it had begun talking with a Spanish food company called Ebro Foods about buying SunRice for $600 million (Australian dollars). The Ebro bid failed when the shareholders voted against it on the 31st May 2011.
