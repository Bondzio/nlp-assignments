Phase

A phase is one part of a cycle or change that goes in a circle. For example, the moon has phases. 
The seasons of the year, spring, summer, fall, and winter, are also phases. The planet Venus has phases, like the moon: Galileo showed that the phases of Venus meant it must go around the Sun, not the earth.
