Parchim Rural District

Parchim is a former district in the southwestern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany.

Most of the district is now used for farming, but in the easternmost part there are several lakes, the largest of them being the Plauer See (39 km²). The Plauer See marks the western end of the Müritz lakeland.

Until 1994 the present-day district was divided into the three districts of Parchim, Sternberg and Lübz.
