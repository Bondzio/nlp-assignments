Make America Great Again

"Make America Great Again" is a common campaign slogan used by American politicians. It is usually used by politicians who intend on running for election. It was first used by Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign. 

The term was created in 1979 during a time in which the United States was suffering from a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation. Usually when the term is used, people use it as a reflection to the Presidency of Ronald Reagan.

Since Reagan left office, the slogan has been used by a variety of politicians. Donald Trump trademarked the slogan and used it in his own presidential campaign.
