Moab

Moab is the historical name for an area of land in Jordan. The land covers the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. It is mountainous. In ancient times, it was the Kingdom of Moab. There have been many archaeological findings that have helped reconstruct its history. It is also described in the Old Testament of the Bible. According to Genesis (19:37), it was inhabited by the children of Moab, a grandson of Lot. The Moabites were often at war with its neighbours to the west, the Israelites.

The capital of Moab was Dibon.

A well-known Moabite is Ruth. According to the Biblical Book of Ruth she married an Israelite man and became by that the greatgrandmother of king David.
