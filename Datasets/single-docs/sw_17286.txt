The 99 Names of Allah (, translit: ) also known as The 99 attributes of Allah, according to Islamic tradition, are the names of Allah revealed by the Creator(Allah) in the Qur'an.

Name-English Name: Arabic 

'Allah' is a personal name for All-Mighty God. The word Allah does not mean god in Arabic because there is a word 'Ilah' in Arabic which means god. The word god simply means something that is worshipped but the word 'Allah' is a unique word for All-Mighty God who has no partners and is the Only One worthy of worship. It is a unique name only for God because the word cannot be changed and is genderless whereas the word god in English can be changed to goddess. Also the word 'Allah' cannot be made plural because All-Mighty God is the One and Only God and no one is worthy of worship except Allah - All-Mighty God, so it clearly fits the unique attributes of Allah. All prophets that have been sent worshipped only One God, Allah- All-Mighty God. They showed submission to Allah and all messengers preached the Message of Allah - All-Mighty God.They all worshipped and obeyed the same God - Allah. Some prophets were even granted miracles by Allah- All-Mighty God. All-Mighty God - Allah is the God all messengers spoke of: the God of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. Allah- All-Mighty God is the Lord of the universe, the Lord of everyone and everything that exists.
