Chelsea Bridge

Chelsea Bridge is a bridge over the River Thames in west London. It connects Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank.

There have been two Chelsea Bridges, on the site of what was an ancient crossing.

The first Chelsea Bridge was called Victoria Bridge. It opened in 1857.

The old bridge was replaced by the current one in 1937.

In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames.
