List of Governors of Barbados

This page contains a list of viceroys in Barbados from when Great Britain started a colony in 1627 by England until Barbados received independence in 1966. From 1833 to 1885, Barbados was part of the colony of the Windward Islands, and the Governor of Barbados represented the monarch in all the Windward Islands. In 1885 Barbados became an independent colony again.


In 1833, Barbados became part of the new colony of the Windward Islands and the Governor of Barbados became viceroy over the new colony as well.


In 1885, Grenada took over responsibility for the Windward Islands instead of Barbados.


On 29 November 1966, Barbados achieved independence from the United Kingdom. For a list of viceroys in Barbados after independence, see Governor-General of Barbados.
