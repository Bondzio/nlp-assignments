Lady Louise Windsor

The Lady Louise Windsor (Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary; born 8 November 2003) is the oldest of the two children of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and Sophie, Countess of Wessex. Lady Louise is 10th in line to the British throne, although she was 8th in line when she was born. Lady Louise is the youngest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II. When her brother was born in 2007, he moved ahead of her in the line of succession. 

Lady Louise attends events such as Trooping the Colour, Christmas and family services, like the Diamond Jubilee service at Saint Paul's Cathedral. Louise was one of the bridesmaids at Prince William and Catherine Middleton's wedding on 29 April 2011. Lady Louise is technically styled as Her Royal Highness Princess Louise of Wessex. But as per her parent's wishes, she uses an aristocratic title rather than a royal one.
