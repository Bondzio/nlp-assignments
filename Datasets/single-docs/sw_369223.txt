Return to Never Land

Return to Never Land (also known as Peter Pan in Disney's Return to Never Land) is a 2002 American animated movie. It was produced by DisneyToon Studios in Sydney, Australia. The movie is a sequel to the 1953 "Peter Pan".

Because nearly five decades had passed since the original Disney movie, a new cast of voice actors was used for this sequel. Kathryn Beaumont, who was the voice of Wendy in the original, recorded all of the now-adult character's dialogue for "Return to Never Land". Disney Studios later had Kath Soucie completely rerecord the role.
