Arts

The arts are a large part of culture, and the word means much more than ""art"". The arts include visual arts, literary arts (i.e. books and other writings) and performing arts (i.e. music, dance, drama). 

Sometimes, in universities, it is shorthand for a wider group of subjects which are properly called the humanities. These include philosophy, theology, literature, languages, and history as well. 

"The arts" are usually contrasted with "The sciences".

Visual arts consist of any art that can be seen. This form of art doesn't change once it has been made.

Architecture is the art and science behind building and sculpture design. Architecture as an art involves making something look beautiful and appealing to others.

Conceptual Art is art in which the idea is more important than the actual beauty of the object.
