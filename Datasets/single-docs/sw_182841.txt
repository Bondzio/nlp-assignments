Eurostar

Eurostar is a high-speed train service in Western Europe connecting London and Kent in the United Kingdom with Paris and Lille in France, and Brussels in Belgium. In addition, there are limited services from London to Disneyland Paris (Gare de Marne-la-Vallée - Chessy) and seasonal destinations in France. All Eurostar trains cross the English Channel through the Channel Tunnel.

The service is operated by 18-carriage Class 373 trains at up to 300 km/h (186 mph) on a network of high-speed lines. Since Eurostar began in 1994, new lines have been built in Belgium (HSL 1) and Southern England (High Speed 1) to the same standard as the LGV Nord line originally used in France, reducing journey times. The two-stage Channel Tunnel Rail Link project was completed on 14 November 2007, when the London terminus of Eurostar transferred from Waterloo International to St Pancras International station.
