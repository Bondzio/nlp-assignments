Pleading

Pleading is usually the first step in a lawsuit. This is when parties formally submit their claims and defenses. A "complaint" is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which starts the lawsuit. A complaint lists the relevant allegations of fact which leads to one or more legal causes of action. It also has a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed. This is called an "ad quod damnum" clause. In some situations, a complaint is called a "petition". In this case the party filing a complaint is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a "petition" or a "bill of complaint in chancery".
