St. James's Palace

St. James Palace was built by Henry VIII, in the early 1530s. It was the main royal residence until Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom moved to Buckingham Palace, in 1837. It is still a working royal palace, and is in Pall Mall. It is not open to the public.

Charles I of England spent his last night here before his execution, in 1649.
