Bojihwayangdong buralsongseonsaeng

Bojihwayangdong buralsongseonsaeng () is a bilingual pun in Classical Chinese and Korean. It is part of the literature of the Joseon period of Korea. It has historically been used as a source of humour in Korean.

When Heo Mok was ordered to attend the academy of the more senior scholar Song Siyeol at Hwayang-dong, he made the journey. Once he got there, he was forced to wait for a long time. Then he found out the appointment had been cancelled. Heo Mok angrily stated ""bojihwayangdong buralsongseonsaeng"". In Classical Chinese, the statement means "Walked to Hwayang-dong; did not see teacher Song", but in native Korean, "boji" () refers to "female genitals", while "bural" () means "testicles", making the expression additionally mean "cunt Hwayang-dong; testicles teacher Song".
