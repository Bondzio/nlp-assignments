Monal

A monal is a bird of the genus Lophophorus of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. The type species of this genus is the Himalayan monal ("Lophophorus impejanus").

All the adult males have very atractive and shiny feathers of different colors (colors appearing to be made of a metal). The females and the young males do not have feathers with many colors; they are reddish brown with some white parts.

Their diet consists of insects and plant parts such as roots, tubers, bulbs and seed.

They live in the rhododendron forests in the high altitudes of the Himalayas and of Sichuan (China).
