Limit (mathematics)

In mathematics, a limit is a guess of the value of a function or sequence based on the points around it. Limits are used to define many topics in calculus, like continuity, derivatives, and integrals.

Limit are written like this:

formula_1

and read as "the limit of f of x, as x approaches c". Limit is shortened to "lim".
