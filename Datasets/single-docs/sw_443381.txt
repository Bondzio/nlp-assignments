Escolania de Montserrat

Escolania de Montserrat is a boys' choir in the Benedictine abbey of Santa Maria de Montserrat. The abbey is near Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The boys are sopranos and altos. Sometimes the Montserrat Chapel Choir sings with them, when needed for the music they are performing.

The Escolania of Montserrat belongs to the Monastery of Monserrat. It is one of the oldest boys choirs in Europe. Records show that the Escolania has been a religious and musical institution since the 14th century. There are more than fifty boys in the choir, from ages nine to fourteen. The boys are from various towns in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Valencian community. At the Escolania, they complete courses at the primary, and beginning of secondary levels. They also study music. The Escolania takes pride in providing high-level musical education. Each student must study two instruments: the piano, and a second orchestral instrument of their choice. They also study Musical Language, Orchestra, and participate in the choir (the distinguished focus of the school).

The school choir sings every day in the Basilica. They often sing in front of large groups of pilgrims and visitors from around the world. More people attend the midday singing of "Salve Regina" than any other performance. They choir have released many albums. They have toured in several countries, including Hungary, Switzerland, France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Poland, and Russia. They have performed in Russia three times (Moscow 2011 & 2013, and St. Petersburg 2011).
