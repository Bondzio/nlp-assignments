Andrew Sachs

Andrew Sachs (Andreas Siegfried Sachs, 7 April 1930 â€“ 23 November 2016) was a German-British actor. 

Sachs was born in Berlin. His family was Jewish. In 1938, they left Germany for London, shortly after Adolf Hitler became Germany's leader. 

Sachs is best known for his role as Manuel on "Fawlty Towers". He also played Albert Einstein in a 1996 episode of Nova on PBS, and provided all the voices in the English version of the 1994 movie version of "Faust". 

He was involved in a controversy when Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross left obscene phone messages on his answerphone stating that Brand had had sex with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, a member of the Satanic Sluts.

Sachs died on 23 November 2016 at a nursing home in Northwood, London from vascular dementia, aged 86.
