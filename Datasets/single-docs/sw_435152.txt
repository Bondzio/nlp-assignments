Districts of Sri Lanka

In Sri Lanka, districts (, ) are the second-level administrative divisions. The first level are the provinces. Each province contains a number of districts. There are 25 districts in the country. They are organized into 9 provinces. Each district is administered under a District Secretary. Secretaries are appointed by the central government.

All population numbers are from the most recent census of Sri Lanka, in 2012. Population density has been calculated using the land area rather than the total area (total area would have included the area of rivers and lakes).
