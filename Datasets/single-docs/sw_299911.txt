2001 Bradford riots

The Bradford Riots were a short but intense period of rioting which began on 7 July 2001, in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was a result of heightened tension between the large and growing ethnic minority communities and the city's white majority. It was stoked by confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and far right groups such as the British National Party and the National Front. Similar race riots had occurred earlier in May in Oldham and in June in Burnley - other parts of northern England.
