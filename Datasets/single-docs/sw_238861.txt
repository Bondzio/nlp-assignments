List of ZIP Code prefixes

ZIP codes are numbered with the first number representing a certain group of U.S. states. The second and third numbers represent a region in that group of states or, in some cases, a large city. The fourth and fifth numbers representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP codes for that region.

This table lists the cities served by each three digit ZIP. If the city name is in CAPITALS, it a three-digit prefix just for that city. If the city is in "italics", it is given a zip code that ends in 01.
