Meshech

Meshech is a person mentioned in the Bible, described in Genesis 10 as the son of Japheth, son of Noah. 

Meshech in the Bible can also mean the tribe that came from his children, or the country where they lived, for example in Psalm 120:5. Many Bible Atlases such as IVP and Zondervan state it was in Asia Minor, while others say the Caucasus.

For Gog, 'the chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal' (Book of Ezekiel 39:1) see Armageddon
