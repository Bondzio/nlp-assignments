Viper

Vipers are a family of venomous snakes, the Viperidae. All have long, hinged fangs that dig deep into their prey and inject venom. There are four subfamilies of the Viperidae. 

All vipers have a pair of long hollow fangs which are used to inject venom from glands found in the back of the upper jaws. Almost all vipers have ridged scales, a well built body with a short tail, and, because of where the venom glands are found, a triangular-shaped head. Slit-shaped pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to see in a wide range of light levels. Vipers are nocturnal, meaning that they sleep in the day and wake up at night and they ambush their prey. 

Most viper species are ovoviviparous, giving birth to live young, but a few lay eggs. The word "viper" is derived from Latin "vivo" = "I live" and "pario" = "I give birth".

Viper snakes are found in Americas, Africa, Eurasia. In the Americas they live from southern Canada, through the United States, Mexico, Central America, and into South America. The only type of viper which lives in the United Kingdom are the adders. 

Type genus = "Vipera"â€”Laurenti, 1768

Vipers are predators, meaning that they eat other animals, their main diet is eating birds (including bird eggs), amphibians, such as frogs and toads, and other small reptiles like lizards and other smaller snakes.
