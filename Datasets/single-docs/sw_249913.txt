Flag of Slovenia

The national flag of Slovenia has three equal horizontal bands of white (top), blue, and red, with the Slovenian coat of arms on the upper left side of the flag centered in the white and blue bands. The coat of arms is a shield with the image of Mount Triglav, Slovenia's highest mountain, in white against a blue background; below it are two blue lines that stand for the Adriatic Sea and local rivers, and above it are three six-pointed stars arranged in an triangle which are taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje, an important Slovenian family.
