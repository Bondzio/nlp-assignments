Division of Riverina

The Division of Riverina is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It is located in south-west rural New South Wales, generally following the Murrumbidgee River valley. It was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first Australian federal election in 1901. It was named after the Riverina region in which it is located. 

The division includes the cities of Wagga Wagga and Griffith and the towns of Coleambally, Coolamon, Gundagai, Hillston,Junee, Leeton, Narrandera, Temora, Tumut, Tumbarumba and West Wyalong. The Sturt Highway runs along the length of the division.
There was a by-election in Riverina in 1904. Robert Blackwood won the seat by only a few votes from John Chanter. The results were challenged in the courts and a new election was held in which Chanter won the seat. There was another by-election in 1965 after Hugh Roberton resigned.
In the 1984 the division was abolished and replaced by the Division of Riverina-Darling. In 1992 the division was re-created.

Originally the division included the Labor-voting mining towns of Broken Hill and Cobar, but these are now in the divisions of Farrer and Parkes. This has made Riverina a safe National Party seat.
Al Grassby was the Minister for Immigration in the Whitlam government.
