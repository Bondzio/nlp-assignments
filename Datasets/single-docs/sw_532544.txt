A Touch of Class

A Touch of Class (also known as ATC) was a pop group based in Germany. It had four members. They each came from different countriesâ€” Joseph "Joey" Murray from New Zealand, Livio Salvi from Italy, Sarah Egglestone from Australia and Tracey Packham from the United Kingdom. The group was active from 1998 to 2003.

They were most popular after the release of their first single, "Around The World (La La La La La)", in 2000. This song was an English version of the song "Pesenka" by Ruki Vverh! It was first released on 9 May 2000. It charted at #1 in Germany for six weeks. It was later a Top 40 hit in the United Kingdom and United States. The song was in a television commercial for General Electric in early 2002. Similar-sounding songs were successful in parts of Europe, but A Touch of Class are mainly remembered for this first hit.

Their first album was "Planet Pop". It was released on 6 February 2001 by Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Republic Records. Their second album was "Touch The Sky". It was not very successful. The group broke up in mid-2003.
