Studio B Productions

Studio B Productions was a children's entertainment logo united by DHX Media and founded as DHX Media/Vancouver in 1988. In 1993, it was joined forces with Magnet Productions due to the fact Gullah Gullah Island had that logo the next year. Three years before, it was joined with Tooniverse, which turned into Tooniverse Songs then. When it joined forces with Moonscoop, it turned into Wildbrain.
