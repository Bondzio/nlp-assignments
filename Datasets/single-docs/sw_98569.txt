Mie Prefecture

Mie prefecture was created by merging the area of Ise Province, Shima Province, Iga Province and Kii Province.

In 1871, the area from the Kisosansen River in the north to the city of Tsu became Anōtsu Prefecture. The area south of Tsu became Watarai Prefecture. In 1876, Anōtsu Prefecture and Watarai Prefecture joined to become Mie Prefecture.

Mie has four dialects…Iga dialect, Ise dialect, Shima dialect, Kisyuu dialect
