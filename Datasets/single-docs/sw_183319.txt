Guru Arjun Dev

Guru Arjan Dev (born April 15 1563) is a Sikh guru. He became a Guru on September 1st 1556. He became a Guru because of the amount he sacrificed for himself. He laid down the foundations for the Harmandir sahib, which means “The Golden Temple”. It was built in the middle of the second sacred [pool] in Ramdaspur that was the tallest building in the town. He thought that it should not be the tallest building in town so he ordered it to be it on the lowest ground in the pool. He helped a lot around and dug wells and laid more foundations.
