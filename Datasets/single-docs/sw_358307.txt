Naughty Dog

Naughty Dog is a video game company founded by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin in 1986. It is part of Sony since 2001. Gavin and Rubin produced more successful games, including "Rings of Power" for the Sega Genesis and "Way of the Warrior" for the 3DO.

After developing the fourth "Crash Bandicoot" game ("Crash Team Racing"), the company began working on "Jak and Daxter" for PlayStation 2. In 2004, Naughty Dog's studio president and co-founder, Jason Rubin left the company to work on a new game named "Iron and the Maiden".
