Christ myth theory

The Christ myth theory (also called the Jesus myth theory, Jesus Myth, and Christ Myth) is the idea that the person named Jesus in the Bible's Gospels is a myth. However, there is a big difference between what the words "myth," "historical," and "fiction" mean. Because of this, there are many different opinions about "how" the Jesus in the Gospels is a myth.
