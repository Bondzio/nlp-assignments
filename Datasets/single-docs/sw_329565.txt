Battle of Balaclava

The Battle of Balaclava was a battle of Crimean war. It was on 25 October 1854 between the alliance of the Ottoman Empire, the French Empire, and the United Kingdom vs. the Russian Empire. The battle ended with a Russian victory. Two of the most important events of the Crimean war took place during the Battle of Balaclava.

The 93rd Highland Regiment (dressed almost all in red) formed a line 2 men thick and stood their ground when the Russian cavalry charged at them.

This event inspired Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem of the same name. The charge was made by the 4th and 13th Light Dragoons, 17th Lancers, and the 8th and 11th Hussars, under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan. Many people died in this charge. 278 of the over 670 soldiers were killed.
