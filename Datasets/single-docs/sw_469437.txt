London Array

The London Array is an 175 turbine 630 MW offshore wind farm located 20Â km off the Kent coast in the outer Thames Estuary in the United Kingdom. At the time of its construction it was the largest offshore wind farm in the world.

Construction of phase 1 of the wind farm began in March 2011 and was completed by mid 2013, being formally opened by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, on 4 July 2013.

The second phase of the project was refused planning consent in 2014 due to possible impacts on sea birds.
