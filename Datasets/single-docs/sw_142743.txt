Ford Freestar

Ford Freestar was a car produced by Ford Motor Company from 2004 through 2007. Even though Ford claimed it was "all-new", it was nothing more than a vaguely modernized Windstar. It didn't sell too well which resulted in a short production run as more people were buying SUV's instead.
