Turban

The Turban is a gift to Sikhs. It is how Sikhs crown themselves as the Singhs and Kaurs who sit on the throne of commitment to their own higher consciousness. For men and women alike, this projective identity conveys royalty, grace, and uniqueness. It is a signal to others that sikhs live in the image of Infinity and are dedicated to serving all. Men's headdress.
