Stompin' Tom Connors

Charles Thomas Connors, OC (February 9, 1936 â€“ March 6, 2013) was a Canadian singer-songwriter. He was one of Canada's most well-known country and folk singers.

He received the nickname "Stompin' Tom" when Boyd MacDonald, a waiter at the King George Tavern introduced him as "Stompin' Tom Connors" and because he used to stomp the heel of his left boot to keep rhythm during his songs.

He spent a small time living with his mother in a low-security women's penitentiary before he was taken by Children's Aid Society and he was later adopted by Cora and Russell Aylward of Skinners Pond, Prince Edward Island.

Some of Connors best known songs are "The Hockey Song" (also known as "The Good Old Hockey Game"), "Big Joe Mufferaw", "The Martin Hartwell Story", "Sudbury Saturday Night", "Bud the Spud", "The Black Donnellys", and "Reesor Crossing Tragedy". Connors also had a miniseries on CBC called "Stompin Tom's Canada" where he met people from all around Canada.

Connors was guest on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2004 when the show had taped a week's-worth of episodes. He performed a rendition of "The Hockey Song" along with the Toronto audience. This was one of the few times that Connors had performed on American television.

Connors died on March 6, 2013 at his home in Halton Hills, Ontario from kidney failure.
