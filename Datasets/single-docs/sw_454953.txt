Presence (album)

Presence is the seventh studio album by English rock band, Led Zeppelin. "Presence" was released on 31 March 1976 through Swan Song Records. Even though the album received mixed reviews from critics and sold slower than the their other studio album, guitarist Jimmy Page called "Presence" the band's "most important" album and proved that they would continue despite their turmoil. The band wrote and recorded the album during troubling times in their history, as lead singer Robert Plant was still recovering from serious injuries that he had suffered in a car accident.
