Asteria

Asteria was the mother of Hecate, Greek goddess of magic and witchcraft. She was the wife of Perses. Asteria was the daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe, and sister of Leto. She was the Titan goddess of falling stars and nighttime divination, such as dreams and astrology. She escaped the advances of Zeus by leaping into the sea and becoming the island Delos, the island upon which her sister Leto eventually gave birth to the twins Apollo and Artemis. As such, she is often labelled "Delos" on Athenian vase-painting.
