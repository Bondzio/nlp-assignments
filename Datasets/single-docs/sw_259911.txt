Independent circuit

In pro wrestling, the independent circuit or indy circuit refers to the many wrestling shows that are much smaller than major wrestling companies, like World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Some popular "indy promotions" are Ring of Honor (ROH), CHIKARA, Dragon Gate USA (DGUSA), and National Wrestling Alliance (NWA).
