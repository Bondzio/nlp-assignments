Albert Abraham Michelson

Albert Abraham Michelson (December 19, 1852 â€“ May 9, 1931) was an American physicist. He was originally from Strzelno (in Prussia, now modern-day Poland). He was known for his work on measuring the speed of light. That work led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907. He was the first American to receive it in the field of science.
