Repeating decimal

Repeating decimal (or recurring decimal) is a decimal where the number or pattern repeats forever. Repeating decimal is resulted when dividing a number by a number that is not divisible except for certain cases like dividing any number by 5. For example, dividing 7 by 3 would result in a repeating decimal, which is 2.333... or 2.. The number or group of numbers that repeats is called a repetend or reptend and the number of numbers in the repetend is called the period length. For 2., 3 is the repetend and the period length is 1.
