Camposaurus

Camposaurus is a dinosaur from the Late Triassic of North America. It is a relative of "Coelophysis". This relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis.

With fossils dating back to 205â€“210 million years ago (mya), it is the oldest known neotheropod. It is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material. 

A study of "Camposaurus arizoniensis" by Ezcurra and Brusatte discovered two unique features. This meant the specimen was a valid genus and species. "Camposaurus" is definitely a neotheropod. Based on phylogenetic analysis, its closest known relative is "Megapnosaurus rhodensis", because they share similarities in the tibia, and ankle. Spielman et al. (2007) put "Camposaurus" in the family Coelophysidae.
