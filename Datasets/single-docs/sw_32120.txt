List of counties of the Republic of China

Taiwan Province is divided into 13 counties (縣; hsien) and 3 provincial cities (市; shih):

"Note":The cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung are managed directly by the central government and are not part of Taiwan province, though the counties of the same name all around these cities are part of the province. The People's Republic of China, which does not control Taiwan Province, does not recognize Taipei and Kaohsiung as central cities and lists them as provincial cities.
