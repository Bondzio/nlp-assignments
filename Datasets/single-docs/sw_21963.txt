Goose

Goose (plural geese) is the general English name for a large number of long-necked birds, belonging to the family "Anatidae". 

This family also includes the swans, which are mostly larger than geese, and the ducks, which are smaller and have short necks.

Both as chicks and as adults, geese show collective animal behaviour. Geese migrate in groups in the spring and fall, flying together in a V-shape.

A male goose is called a "gander" and a baby goose is called a "gosling". A group of geese is called a "gaggle".
