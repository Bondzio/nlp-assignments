Enterobacteriaceae

Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of bacteria commonly affecting the stomach. The name is derived from the prefix "entero-", meaning intestine; "bacteria", meaning bacteria; and "ceae", meaning family or group. It includes many of the more familiar pathogens, such as "Salmonella" and "Escherichia coli".

On February 19, 2015, 179 people in Los Angeles, California may have been exposed to the bacteria. At least two people have been reported dead. The bacteria has been called a "superbug" by news reporters. It was confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.
