Quinoa

Quinoa (, from ) is a species of goosefoot ("Chenopodium"). It is a grain-like crop grown primarily for its edible seeds. 

Quinoa is not a real cereal, or grain, as it is not a member of the grass family. As a chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beets, spinach, and tumbleweeds. Its leaves are also eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth. Quinoa greens are not widely available for purchase. Quinoa gives high quality protein and other nutrients. It has been called a 'superfood'.
