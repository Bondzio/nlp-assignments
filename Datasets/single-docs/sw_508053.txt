Vermont's at-large congressional district

Vermont has been represented in the United States House of Representatives by a single at-large congressional district since the 1930 census, when the state lost its second seat. 

There were once six districts in Vermont. Bernie Sanders (Independent) held the seat from 1991 until 2007, when he became a U.S. Senator. Democrat Peter Welch has represented the state since 2007.
