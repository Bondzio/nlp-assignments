Cluedo (game show)

Cluedo was a UK television game show. It was based on the Cluedo board game. Each week, a reenactment of the murder of a visiting guest at the home Arlington Grange was played. Questions would be asked of the suspects. Only the murderer could lie. Using deduction, celebrity guests had to discover who committed the murder, which of six weapons was used and in which room it was committed. Viewers were invited to play along at home.

The show's six suspects were the original from the board game. The show's six weapons were different between episodes. The show's six rooms were: the Drawing Room, the Kitchen, the Dining Room, the Billiard Room, the Library and the Study.
