Ed and Lorraine Warren

Edward "Ed" Warren Miney (September 7, 1926 – August 23, 2006) and Lorraine Rita Warren (née "Moran", born January 31, 1927) were American paranormal investigators and authors associated with famous cases of haunting. 

Edward was a World War II United States Navy veteran and former police officer who became a self-taught, self-proclaimed expert demonologist, author, and lecturer. His wife Lorraine was a professed clairvoyant and a light trance medium who worked closely with her husband.

Their cases have even become blockbuster movies such as "The Amityville Horror", "The Haunting in Connecticut", and in "The Conjuring".

Both Ed and Lorraine Warren were born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Ed Warren died in Monroe, Connecticut from natural causes, at the age of 79.
