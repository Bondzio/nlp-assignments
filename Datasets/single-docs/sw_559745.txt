For the third consecutive year, the Canadian Junior Hockey League Prospects Game was a part of the WJAC festivities. Just like the previous four Prospects Games, the event was actually two "prospect" games with the President's Cup going to the winning goal aggregate.

Prospects East won their fourth President's Cup in nine years with an 8-4 aggregate victory (4-2, 4-2) over Prospects West.
