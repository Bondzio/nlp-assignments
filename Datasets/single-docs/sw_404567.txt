Thomas Tinker

Thomas Tinker ( 1581–1620/21) and his wife and son were Separatists from the Netherlands who travelled on the Pilgrim Ship "Mayflower" in 1620. Separatists were people who did not belong to the Church of England.

Most scholars believe that Tinker was born in 1581 in Norfolk England. He moved to Leiden and became a citizen there in the early 1600s. He married in 1609 and had one son.

Tinker, his wife and son left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in the Colony of Virginia, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. Thomas Tinker was a signer to the "Mayflower Compact".

Bradford wrote they "died in the first sickness". That was in December 1620 or January 1621. Thomas Tinker and his son was buried in Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, with many passengers who died in the early days. The place of Tinker's wife grave is unknown.
