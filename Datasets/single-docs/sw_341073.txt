Priapus

In Greek mythology, Priapus was a minor god of fertility and a protector of gardens, fruit plants, livestock and male genitals. He is always represented with a giant phallus, of which the medical term priapism originated. He was a son of Aphrodite and Dionysus. According to one myth, he disliked donkeys, and they were often sacrificed to Priapus.
