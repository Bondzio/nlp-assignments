Dispersion

Dispersion is the idea that the frequency of a wave influences its velocity (speed). Dispersion is most easily seen in light, when all the colors inside white light become separated by a prism. 

When a white beam is shone at the prism, all of the colors in the light (colour spectrum) are slowed down when they meet the prism. Each color then refracts (bends) at different angles, making us see a rainbow.
