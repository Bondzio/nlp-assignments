Cattistock

Cattistock is a village in west Dorset, England, in the upper reaches of the Frome Valley eight miles north west of Dorchester. The village has a population of 440 (2002).

The church was rebuilt in the 19th century, by architects Sir George Gilbert Scott and his son George Gilbert Scott Junior. The Perpendicular-styled tower was the work of the latter, and has led to the church being called the 'Cathedral of the Frome Valley'.
