Rohingya people

The Rohinga are an ethnic group of Southeast Asia. They are mainly Muslim. They live in the Arakan State in western Myanmar, and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in south-eastern Bangladesh. They are considered refugees by the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments, and are not citizens of either country.
