Hargitay's first movie role came when Jayne Mansfield demanded he have a part in her newest movie, "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" (1957). The two had met the year before at "The Mae West Show" at the Latin Quarter nightclub. When Jayne saw Mickey on the stage, she told the waiter, "I’ll have a steak and that tall man on the left." 

The two fell head over heels in love. They were never seen apart. 20th Century Fox didn't want Hargitay in "Rock Hunter", because they hated Mansfield's idea of Hargitay as her "only" lover. Fox liked their sex symbols to be single. But when Jayne told the studio that she would turn the movie down, they gave in and let Hargitay appear in a bit part. 

In 1960, Jayne and Mickey would play the lead roles in "The Loves of Hercules". The movie was shot in Italy. It was never released in the United States. Over the next few years Mickey and Jayne, together, would appear in, "Promises! Promises!" (1963) and "L'Amore Primitivo" (1964).
