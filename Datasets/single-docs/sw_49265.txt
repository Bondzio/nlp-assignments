Balfour Declaration of 1917

The Balfour Declaration of 1917 was a policy by the government of the United Kingdom to discuss the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. The declaration also said that Britain supported plans for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The issuance of the Declaration had many long lasting consequences, and was a key moment in the lead-up to the Arabâ€“Israeli conflict, often referred to as the world's "most intractable conflict".
