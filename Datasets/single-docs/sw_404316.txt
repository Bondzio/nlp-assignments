Israel Aircraft Industries Kfir

The Israel Aircraft Industries Kfir or IAI Kfir is an Israeli fighter-bomber aircraft. It is based on the French Mirage 5 but with an american turbojet and avionics. It is a single or dual seat.

When Israel stopped using Kfir in 1996, the aircraft was sold to foreign countries. Colombia, Ecuador, and Sri Lanka bought some of them. Between 1985 and 1989, the U.S. Navy rented twenty five single-seat Kfir, as F-21A. American Kfir were used for "dissimilar air combat training", for simulation of Soviet fighter aircraft like MiG-23 Flogger.

Sri Lanka used the Kfir against the Tamils Tigers rebellion.
