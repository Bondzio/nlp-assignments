Aldgate tube station

Aldgate tube station is a London Underground station at Aldgate in the City of London.

The station is on the Circle Line between Tower Hill and Liverpool Street. It is also the eastern terminus of the Metropolitan line. It is in Travelcard Zone 1, and its ticket office is part-time only.

Platforms 1 and 4 at Aldgate are two of the only three platforms on the network to be served exclusively by the Circle Line (the other being Platform 2 at Gloucester Road). All other Circle Line platforms are shared by the District, Metropolitan and/or Hammersmith & City Lines.

Aldgate tube station is important in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans".
In the story, Cadogan West is found dead on the tracks near the station. We later know that the body was placed on top of the train before its arrival at the station.
