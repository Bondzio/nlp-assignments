Emperor Suinin

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

The "Gukanshō" records that Suinin he ruled from the palace of "Tamaki-no-miya" at Makimuku in what will come to be known as Yamato province.

Suinin is almost certainly a legend; but the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" record his name and genealogy. He was the third son of Emperor Sujin and Empress Sukulito Sakayamas.

The limited information about Suinin does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

One of Suinin's daughters was Yamatohime-no-mikoto. She established a site for ceremonies honouring the Shinto sun goddess (Amaterasu Omikami). In the region of Ise, she founded the Ise Shrine. She became the first Saiō at Ise.

The records of Asama Shrine at the base of Mount Fuji describe events in this time frame. The earliest Shinto ceremonies in honour of Konohanasakuya-hime were in the 3rd year of the reign of Emperor Suinin (垂仁天皇3年).

"Nihonshoki" describes a wrestling match during his era. This was the origin of Sumo wrestling.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Suinin. 

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
