Cliché

A cliché, in English is a phrase which is used too much. Originally, the word meant (in French) a stereotype plate, which is a term in printing.

A cliché is a stock expression used again and again. It has "lost its freshness and vigour through overuse, and suggests insincerity, lack of thought or laziness on the part of the writer".


Style guides advise writers to avoid clichés.
