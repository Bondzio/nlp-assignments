Non-interventionism

Non-interventionism or non-intervention is a foreign policy that holds a country should avoid all wars unless it is defending itself from attack. It promotes neutrality and discourages alliances with other nations, but still encourages diplomacy.

The original, more formal definition is that non-interventionism is a policy of not interfering in the affairs of another country without its permission.
