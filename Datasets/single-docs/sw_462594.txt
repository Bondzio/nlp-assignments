Royal Asiatic Society

The Royal Asiatic Society (RAS), in full the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland was made in 1824, under a Royal Charter.

The main aim of this Society is to study and to do research on all kinds of subjects about Asia. The members (called 'Fellows') live in the United Kingdom and many other countries of the world, and they write 'FRAS' after their names, to show they are its members.

The Society also publishes the famous journal, "Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society".
