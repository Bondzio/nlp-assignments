Soundgarden was formed in 1984 by vocalist Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. The band signed with the independent label Sub Pop and released the "Screaming Life" EP in 1987 and the "Fopp" EP in 1988. In 1988, the band signed with legendary punk record label SST Records and released its debut full-length album "Ultramega OK". The band subsequently signed with A&M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign with a major label. In 1989, the band released its first album for a major label, "Louder Than Love".

In 1990, the band was joined by a new bass player, Ben Shepherd. They released "Badmotorfinger" in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention being paid to the Seattle music scene. The band's next album was to be its breakthrough. "Superunknown", released in 1994, debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200 and launched several successful singles, including "Spoonman" and "Black Hole Sun". In 1996, the band released its fifth studio album, "Down on the Upside"; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by "Superunknown". 

In 1997, the band broke up because they could no longer agree on how their music sounded. The members worked on other projects for more than ten years. Soundgarden got back together in 2010. Two years later, they released their sixth studio album, "King Animal".
