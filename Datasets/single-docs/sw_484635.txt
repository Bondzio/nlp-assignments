ABC Dunhill Records

ABC Records purchased Dunhill Records in 1966, forming ABC Dunhill Records. They purchased Don Robey's record labels on May 23, 1973. These included Duke Records, Peacock Records, Back Beat Records and Song Bird Records. Afterwards, they also purchased the Famous Music record labels from Gulf and Western in 1974. These included Dot Records and Blue Thumb Records. With the Famous acquisition, ABC gained a distribution deal with Sire Records. ABC distributed (through Sire) the first releases by punk band the Ramones. Sire switched to Warner Bros. distribution in 1977, being sold to WB a year later.
