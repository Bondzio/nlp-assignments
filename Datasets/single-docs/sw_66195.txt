Acid rock

Acid rock is a form of rock music, focusing mainly on hallucinations and drugs. It is related to psychedelic rock. It is mostly an off-beat style. It uses vivid imagery, and sometimes strange sound/musical effects (like backward recorded music).

"Acid rock" was popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. But it is not very popular today.

Acid Rock got its name from the mixture of music and the drug LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), which most people call "acid". "Acid rock" is usually recorded when the mucisian was high on LSD. Often the lyrics are about hallucinations.
