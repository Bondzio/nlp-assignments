Issei

The character and uniqueness of the "Issei" is recognized in its social history.

The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.

Imigration to Brazil began in 1908. Today, the community established by the "Issei" has become the largest Japanese emigrant population outside of Japan, including approximately 1.5 million Brazilians. Other "Issei" established themselves in the United States, Canada, and Peru. 

In the 1930s, the term "Issei" came into common use. The word replaced the term "immigrant" ("ijusha"). This change in usage mirrored an evolution in the way the "Issei" looked at themselves. The label "Issei" also included the idea of belonging to the new country. Other terns like "Nisei" were modeled after this "Issei" pattern or template.

The term "Nikkei" (日系) was created by sociologists in the late 20th century. The "Nikkei" include all of the world's Japanese immigrants and their descendants.

The "Issei" were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice. Their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren grew up with a national and cultural point-of-view that was different from their parents.

Although the "Issei" kept an emotional connection with Japan, they created homes in a country far from Japan.

The "Issei," "Nisei" and "Sansei" generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, and religious practice, and other matters.
