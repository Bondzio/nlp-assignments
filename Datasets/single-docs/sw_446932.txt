Sportsnet 360

Sportsnet 360 is a Canadian English language cable and satellite television specialty channel. Sportsnet 360 is owned by Rogers Media. They show sports highlights, news, analysis programming as well as live sports coverage with basketball, college/university sports, mixed martial arts, professional wrestling, and soccer. 

The channel was first launched in 1994 and was known as Sportscope. It was relaunched in May 1997 under the name Headline Sports with channel licencing Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

The licence was rewritten by the CRTC to allow live sports programming and because of this, as well as legal issues with U.S. cable news channel CNN Headline News which also had a "Headline Sports" segment, the channel became known as The Score Television Network. 

On October 19, 2012, they were acquired by Rogers Media for $167 million. On July 1, 2013, Rogers renamed the channel Sportsnet 360.
