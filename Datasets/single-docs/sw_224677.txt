Horned Sungem

The Horned Sungem ("Heliactin bilophus") is a species of hummingbird. It can make 90 wingbeats per second when it's hovering to drink nectar from flowers. A wingbeat is one complete up-and-down movement, which means that the horned sungem moves its wing muscles at a rate of more than 10,000 times per minute. It lives in Bolivia, Brazil, and Suriname. It likes mostly dry open or semi-open habitats, such as savanna and Cerrado. It does not like thick humid forest.
