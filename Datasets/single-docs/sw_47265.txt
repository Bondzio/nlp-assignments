Natural disaster

A natural disaster is a major event caused by natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, hurricanes,tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster causes loss of life or property damage, and leaves some economic damage after it has been completed

It is the damage to humans and their property which counts most. Therefore one can say: "disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability". If a strong earthquake happens in uninhabited areas, it is usually not seen as a disaster.

The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement was established to help in emergencies including natural disasters. Geneva Conventions, and Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provide a framework of international law, both humanitarian and human rights.
