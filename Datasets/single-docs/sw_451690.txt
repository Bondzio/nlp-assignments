Thermal radiation

Thermal radiation is radiation that can be seen as either heat or light. It is a form of heat transfer that is moved from one place to another by electromagnetic radiation waves or rays. It does not require a form of matter to be transferred.

For example a person in front of a fire can warm up because of the light of the fire, even if the air is cold.

Another example of thermal radiation is the heat that comes from the Sun to the Earth.
