The Chinese Football Association Super League (Chinese: "中国足球协会超级联赛"; Pinyin: "Zhōngguó Zúqiú Xiéhuì Chāojí Liánsài"; usually called Chinese Super League ("中超联赛") or CSL; and known as Ping An Chinese Football Association Super League for sponsorship reasons) is the highest tier of professional association football in China. It is controlled by the Chinese Football Association.

The league was created in 2004 and replaced the "Chinese Football Association Jia-A League".

Currently, 16 teams play in the league. The Chinese Super League has been won by 7 teams: Shanghai Shenhua, Shenzhen Jianlibao, Dalian Shide, Shandong Luneng, Changchun Yatai, Beijing Guoan, and Guangzhou Evergrande.

In 1994, the Chinese Jia-A League became the country's first professional football league. People in the Chinese Football Association began to talk about creating a new league in late-2000. In 2002, the CFA made a decision to establish the Chinese Super League, which started in 2004.
