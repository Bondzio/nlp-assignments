The Rescuers Down Under

The Rescuers Down Under is a 1990 American animated adventure movie produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. It was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution on November 16, 1990. The movie is the sequel to the 1977 movie "The Rescuers", which was based on the novels of Margery Sharp. The movie is based on the characters created by Sharp.

This movie, along with "Fantasia 2000" and "Winnie the Pooh" are the only Disney sequels that are part of the Disney canon. This is because all three were produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Set in the Australian Outback, "The Rescuers Down Under" was Eva Gabor's final movie role before her retirement from acting in 1994 and death in 1995.

"The Rescuers Down Under" has three characters from the first movie: Bernard, Bianca, and the Chairmouse. All of them are played by the same actors as in the first movie.


"The Rescuers Down Under" was released in the Walt Disney Classics video series on September 20, 1991 with a home video trailer for "The Jungle Book", while "The Rescuers" was released on VHS a year later in September 1992. However, unlike "The Rescuers", "The Rescuers Down Under" did not make it to the "Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection". It was re-released on VHS and DVD on August 1, 2000 as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection.

"The Rescuers Down Under" was released alongside "The Rescuers" on Blu-ray in a "2-Movie Collection" on August 21, 2012 to commemorate the first movie's 35th anniversary.
