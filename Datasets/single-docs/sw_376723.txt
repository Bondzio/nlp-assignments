Anointing of the Sick

Anointing of the Sick is a sacrament (a sacred ceremony) in Roman Catholicism and other Christian denominations. It is given to people who are "in danger due to sickness or old age". 

A person does not have to be dying to receive the Anointing of the Sick. It can be done for anyone with a medical problem which they could die from.

Anointing of the Sick is also called Unction. In the past, it was called Extreme Unction. ("Anointing" and "Unction" are both words for putting oil on a person. Oil is an important part of the ceremony.)

They should call for the elders of the Church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. And their prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make them well. And if they have committed sins, these will be forgiven." , and also talk about the anointing of the sick.
