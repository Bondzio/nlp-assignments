Clinometer

A clinometer is an instrument that is used for measuring the angle or elevation of slopes. The name "clinometer" comes from Greek and English words. "Klinein" (Greek) means to slope. "Meter" (English) means measurement.

A simple way to create a clinometer is to tape a straw to the bottom of a protractor, then tape a piece of string to the 90 degree line. Finally, you can add a small weight onto the string to allow it to stay straight. It is recommended you use something with a hole in it, like a washer or a potato
