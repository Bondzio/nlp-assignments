Guineafowl

The Guineafowl are a family of birds. It is in the same order as the pheasants, turkeys and other game birds. Guineafowl are native to the dry arid areas of Africa. They are now bred for meat especially in India.

Guineafowl are chicken-like African birds. They include the helmeted guineafowl ("Numida meleagris"). It has a horny growth on the head, white-spotted feathers, and fleshy cheek "wattles" (loose folds of skin). It is the ancestor of the domestic guinea fowl. Guinea fowl mostly eat things found on the ground. They eat insects, leaves, and snails. At night, they roost in trees.
