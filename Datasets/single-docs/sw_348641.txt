Variable Antshrike

The Variable Antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens) is a species of bird in the Thamnophilidae family found most in South America. It is (as its name) arguably the species of antbird with the most variable plumage. This leads to claims that it includes more than one species, but evidence suggests that this is incorrect.

The Variable Antshrike is about long.

The Variable Antshrike is found mostly in eastern and southern Brazil. It is also seen in Pernambuco and Alagoas. From southern Brazil, its range spreads through Uruguay, Paraguay, northern Argentina, Bolivia, and along the eastern slope of the Andes in Peru, as far north as the Amazonas Region.

It has many habitats, but most of it is found in foothills in north-eastern Brazil, and does not live in lands higher than 2600 meters (8500 ft).
