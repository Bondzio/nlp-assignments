1936 North American heat wave

The 1936 North American heat wave was the most severe heat wave in United States history. It happened in the middle of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.

The heat wave began in late June. It created great human suffering. It also caused drought in the Midwest and Great Plains. The lack of moisture, along with heat, destroyed huge numbers of crops.

This heat wave set records in many states, including Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois. In some states, the 1936 records were not broken until 2012. In Ohio, the temperature reached 110Â°F, almost tying the 1934 temperature record there.

More than 5,000 people in the United States died from this heat wave.

The heat also affected Canada.
