White flight

The term white flight represents large-scale migrations of White people from large cities around Europe and the United States starting in the mid 20th century. Those large cities were primarily in Midwestern States and Northeastern States: Whites relocated out of those regions and into Southeastern and Southwestern States like Arizona and Texas. Midwestern cities like Chicago, Detroit or St. Louis, however, lost population of many Whites since the mid 20th century.
