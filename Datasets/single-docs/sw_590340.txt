Water taxi

A water taxi (also known as a water bus or sightseeing boat,) is a watercraft used to provide public or private transport in an urban area. A water taxi might make multiple stops, similar to a bus, or to on-demand locations, similar to a taxi. A boat service going between two points would normally be called a ferry rather than a water bus or taxi.
