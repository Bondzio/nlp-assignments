Hœnir

Hœnir is a warrior god in Norse mythology. He is sometimes confused with Vili. Hœnir is part of the Aesir. Hœnir and Mimir were hostages in a war between the Aesir and Vanir gods. He was an original Aesir god. Hœnir usually relied on Mimir. Hœnir is the god of silence, Spirituality, poetry, passion, battle frenzy, and sexual ecstasy Óðr.
Hoenir is The travel companion of Odin and Loki, He was also a part of the creation of Ask and Embla.

Hœnir also goes with Mímir to the Vanir as hostage, in order to seal a truce to the Æsir-Vanir war. During the negotiations, Hœnir heavily relies on Mímir to address any query as the latter was better informed and knowledgeable. The Vanir perceive this as indecision and thus a character flaw, and end up beheading Mímir as retaliation, thinking the Æsir cheated them in the hostage exchange. Hœnir is one of the few gods to survive Ragnarök.
