Lalande 21185

Lalande 21185 is a red dwarf in the constellation of Ursa Major. Although relatively close by, it is only magnitude 7 in visible light and thus is too dim to see with the unaided eye. The star is visible through a small telescope.

At approximately away this star is the fifth closest stellar system to the Sun; only the Alpha Centauri system, Barnard's Star, WISE 1049-5319 and Wolf 359 are closer. Because of its proximity it is a frequent subject for astronomical surveys and other research. It is known by other designations, such as BD+36 2147, Gliese 411, and HD 95735.
