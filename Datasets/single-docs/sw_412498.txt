Division of Corangamite

The Division of Corangamite is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. It was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for Lake Corangamite. 

It covers an area of 7624 km2 in the Western District of Victoria. It has always included Colac, but now most of its voters live in the southern suburbs of Geelong and coastal towns including Anglesea and Queenscliff. 

Corangamite was identified as the most marginal seat in Australia for the 2013 election. It only needed a swing of 0.3% to change to the Liberal Party. The Liberals received a swing of 4.22% and won the seat.

Famous members include James Scullin who later became Prime Minister of Australia, and Richard Crouch who gave the money to set up the Prime Ministers Avenue in the Ballarat Botanical Gardens. Tony Street held a number of important roles in the Fraser Government including Minister for Foreign Affairs.
