The Cardigans

The Cardigans are a Swedish pop rock group that started in October 1992. Their debut studio album "Emmerdale" gave them very strong base in Sweden. However, it was not until their 1995 album "Life" was released that an international reputation was secured. Their popularity really soared in 1996 when the song "Lovefool" was released. They've carried other hit songs in addition to that. The group went on hiatus in 2006.
