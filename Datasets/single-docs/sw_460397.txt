Matt Heafy

Matthew Kiichi Heafy (born January 26, 1986) is a Japanese musician. He is the lead singer and guitarist of the heavy metal band Trivium. He joined the band at the age of twelve. 

Shortly after Ember to Inferno was released, Heafy wanted to try out post-hardcore music. He created a joke band called "Tomorrow Is Monday". In a 2008 interview with Rock Sound he said the first song was written, recorded and edited in one hour.
