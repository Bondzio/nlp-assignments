Catalan independence

The Catalan independence or separatism is a political movement that supports the independence of Catalonia or the Catalan countries from Spain and France. The Catalan independence movement began in the 19th century. The independentists believe that Catalonia is a nation. Catalonia has its own language (Catalan language) and culture (Catalan culture).

During the Francisco Franco dictatorship, Catalans and the Catalan language were oppressed. Recently, the number of people who support Catalan independence has increased. In 2012 there was a demonstration in Barcelona with 1.500.000 people. The majority of the parliament in Catalunya wants to have a referendum on independence, and 55% identify as separatists.

The Estelada flag is the symbol of the Catalan independence movement.
