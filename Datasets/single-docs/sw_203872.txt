WWE New Year's Revolution

New Year's Revolution was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, that was shown every January by the American professional wrestling promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The event was created in 2005, with its first event shown in January of that year. To go with the brand extension, only wrestlers from the Raw brand were on it during the event's history.

Since its creation in 2005, the event has been held in one country: the United States. It has been held in two U.S. states and once in Puerto Rico, where every event has been held in an indoor arena. Each event showed professional wrestlers from WWE competing in various professional wrestling match types. Since the first event, three championship matches have taken place in the main event.

New Year's Revolution was removed from the WWE schedule when they removed more PPVs per year. Currently, the only PPV run by the WWE in January is the Royal Rumble.
