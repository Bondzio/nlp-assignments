Siren Song of the Counter Culture

Siren Song of the Counter Culture is the third album by American punk rock band Rise Against, released on August 10, 2004. It is the band's first release on a major label. The album sold very well, mainly because of the success of its single, "Swing Life Away", which reached number 12 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks, making it the band's highest-ranking single at the time. Also faring well were the album's other three singles, "Give It All" (number 37) and "Life Less Frightening" (number 33) and "Paper Wings". Despite its big commercial success, Siren Song of the Counter Culture is not Rise Against's highest charting album on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 136; subsequent albums The Sufferer & The Witness and Appeal to Reason both charted higher, peaking at number 10 and number 3. The album was awarded Gold by the RIAA on March 10, 2009.
