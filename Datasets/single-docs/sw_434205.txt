Internet café

An Internet café (also called a Cybercafé) is a type of café. It is a business that provides Internet access to the public, usually for a fee. It also sells coffee and food. Internet cafés were introduced in the 1990s. The spread of modern-style cafés to many places, urban and rural, went hand in hand with computers. Many Internet cafés offer wireless Internet or have computers customers can use. They also offer telephones and newspapers. Internet café users need to be aware they have less security than most private networks. They are also more exposed to malicious software, also called 'malware'.
