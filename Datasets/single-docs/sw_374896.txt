Werner Leich is a Protestant clergyman. From 1978 to 1992 he was the bishop of the Evangelical Church in Thuringia, for the greater part during the era of the German Democratic Republic.

Leich was born in MÃ¼hlhausen on January 31 1927. From 1942 to 1945 Leich was a voluntary member of the German Luftwaffe with the rank of Fahnenjunker. He volunteered to ""battle for the salvation of Germany"". After World War II he finished his school and from 1947 he started studying theology at the University of Marburg and Heidelberg University.

In 1951 he started his career as a clergyman. A year later he married Trautel, with whom he has a son and daughter. Since 1960 he was a member of the Synod of the Evangelical Church. He was vice-president of the synod from 1967 to 1978 and bishop of the state of Thuringia from 1978 to 1992. In that year he retired.

During a lot of his career, he had to deal with being able to worship God in an environment of anti-religious communism. He described it as "a lot of times we did hide being Christians".
