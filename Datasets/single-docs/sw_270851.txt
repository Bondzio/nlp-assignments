Y10K

The Y10K, literally meaning the "Year 10,000 Problem", is an error machines and computers will encounter when the need to express five digits for a year.

Some people practice the art of cutting the last two digits of a decade. For example, the "1970's" becomes just the "70's".
However, this becomes a problem, because to keep order, one will now need to take the last three digits, rather than two.

This is also a problem because the "000's" might be confused with the legit "00's", representing a new century. Also, the year can overflow with certain computer programs. On Microsoft Excel, for instance, in a cell the date 12/31/9999 is a legit date, but 1/1/10,000 causes a problem. The date "ten thousand" is unable to be supported, producing a large negative instead.

So far, the Long Now Foundation is able to preempt the Y10K by adding a "0" in front of the date. So the year 2000, would look like this: "02000". However, it would still be subsceptible to a "Y100K" problem.
