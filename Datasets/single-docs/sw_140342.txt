Opel Sintra

The Opel Sintra is an Large MPV produced by the German automaker Opel
from 1996 to 1999. The Sintra is branded as Opel in Europe and Vauxhall in Great Britain.

The reason for the Sintra to end production was because EuroNCAP tested a 1998 model and found it only scored 2.5 Stars, forcing Opel to drop the model in 1999. The model was criticised for its dull styling and poor build quality as well as being unsatisfying to own. Because the Astra-Based Zafira MPV debuted when the Sintra finished production in 1999, sometimes it is said that the Zafira replaced the Sintra,but actually Opel never had another Large MPV after the Sintra, and then eventually Opel abandoned the Large MPV style in Europe.
