Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII

Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII is a third-person shooter roleplaying video game. It is a sequel to "Final Fantasy VII". 

Three years after the what happened in "Final Fantasy VII", a group of powerful SOLDIERs that nobody had seen before appear, stopping the peace enjoyed by the people of world. The members of this mysterious group are the ones who were trapped under the ruins of Midgar for three years- the Deepground SOLDIERs. The Deepground SOLDIERs want to call forth the final WEAPON, Omega, before it is supposed to be. But to do that, the DGS need Vincent Valentine to lead the way to Omega.

Vincent Valentine is chased by many members of the mysterious group. An chain of events leads Vincent to the truth about his past and forces him to be the leader again in a battle for the planet itself and all those living in it.

Reeve Tuesti, who used to be the Head of Urban Development at Shinra (and the remote controller of Cait Sith), is now the leader of the World Regenesis Organization, which looks after the planet and stops people from hurting it any more. Yuffie Kisaragi is another member of the organization, and several other characters from the original game provide the World Regenesis Organization with more help.

The game begins with a Full Motion Video showing the attack on the town of Kalm by Deepground soldiers. Vincent stops the attack, but encounters Azul and Shelke. Azul and Shelke are members of the Tsviets, Deepground's elite force of supersoldiers.
