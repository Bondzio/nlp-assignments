Amerigo Vespucci

Amerigo Vespucci (9 March 1454 - 22 February 1512) was an Italian merchant, explorer and cartographer. He was the first person to explain that the New World discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 was not the eastern area of Asia, but an unknown continent (the Americas). America was named after the great man Amerigo Vespucci.

It is also popularly believed that North and South America derive their name from a Latinized version his first name.

Vespucci died of malaria.
