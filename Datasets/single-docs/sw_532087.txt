President of China

The President of China (officially President of the People's Republic of China) is the head of state of the People's Republic of China (PRC). On paper, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers. However, in recent years the General Secretary of the Communist Party has also served simultaneously as President. His election to the office makes him paramount leader of China. The office is classified as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post.

The current President is Xi Jinping. He took office on 14 March 2013.
