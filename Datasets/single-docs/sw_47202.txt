Flyover

A flyover is something people do with airplanes or helicopters. It means flying over people who are watching. Sometimes the airplanes fly very low to make it more exciting. The Blue Angels are a special group of pilots that do a lot of flyovers at events.

Sometimes military aircraft fly over the enemy to try to scare the people they are fighting against.
