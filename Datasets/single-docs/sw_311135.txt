Ise Province

The province had borders with Iga, Kii, Mino, Ōmi, Owari, Shima, and Yamato.

When the province was created in 646, its capital city was Uji-Yamada. 

Before Nara period, Ise Shrine, the holiest Shinto shrine is established in this Province and here is introduced by a word "Kamukaze" in waka rhetorics in Nara periode. In the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road was the main route between the Imperial capital at Kyoto and the main city of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The road passed through Ise.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Ise Province were reformed in the 1870s.

The World War II Japanese battleship "Ise" was named after this province.

"Tsubakiōkamiyashiro" ("Tusbaki jinja/Nakato jinja") was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") for the province.
