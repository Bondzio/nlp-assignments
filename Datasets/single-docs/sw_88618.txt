Motorola RAZR V3

Motorola RAZR V3 (said ""Razer"", IPA://) is a thin clamshell mobile/cellular camera phone designed and made by Motorola. The phone was originally a fashion phone, but has now grown to many different versions in many different designs, when in 2005 the phone went into the main market and was sold at a medium price. On May 15, 2007, Motorola showed the new RAZR 2, with a bigger screen, easier to use, and Linux, with a high price of $600 with service agreement and $800 without. In 2005, "PC World" put the RAZR at #12 in "The 50 Greatest Gadgets of the Past 50 Years".

The dark blue version available from Tesco in the UK is a V3r with no memory slot or iTunes, (and more difficult to unlock).

At October 30, 2006, the phone was sold with a tattoo design on it on T-Mobile in USA. The tattoo designs were made by Ami James from the TLC reality television show, Miami Ink.

After the "RAZR V3", Motorola sold the RAZR V3i. This newer version of the phone improved some of the things that were bad about the original phone, for example, it had a better (1.23 megapixel) camera with 8x digital zoom, better screens, and allowed people to use memory cards in them. The V3i software is very similar to the Motorola V635.

The V3i can has iTunes music player, which has a 50 or 100 song limit on the phone, depending on where the phone was made.

The Motorola RAZR V3i was on most networks in the world in 2005â€“2006. In the U.S. the phone was released through Cingular Wireless on September 6, 2006, with a new activation price of $299.

This was the original color.

At December 8, 2005 Motorola worked with Dolce & Gabbana, the Italian fashion company, to produce a special version of the RAZR V3i, the "Motorola RAZR V3i Dolce & Gabbana". The phone was gold in color. Only 1,000 of the original limited version phones were made and sold.

On June 1, 2006, Motorola and Dolce & Gabbana started selling the RAZR V3i Dolce & Gabbana again. This version had a D&G leather holder, Bluetooth headphone, and FM earphones. It was sold at all big Motorola shops and some D&G shops.

A red version was sold for the (PRODUCT)RED charity. A percentage of the profit went to the charity to help fight AIDS in Africa.

The RAZR V3r and RAZR V3t are different versions the RAZR V3i. Instead of having iTunes, they have Motorola's Digital Audio Player (DAP) music player, which has no song limit, but takes longer to load, and uses more battery. However, it takes considerably longer time to load and uses the V3's battery at a much faster rate than iTunes does.
