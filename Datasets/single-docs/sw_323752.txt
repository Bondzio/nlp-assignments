Namie, Fukushima

Namie was damaged in the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.

In April 2011, the Japanese government made people leave here because of radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. 

Before people left, stone from a quarry in Namie was sent to make concrete for about 60 buildings. The stone and the concrete is radioactive.

The people who used to live in Namie are called "nuclear refugees".
