Germaine Mason

Germaine Mason (20 January 1983 â€“ 20 April 2017) was a Jamaican-born British track and field athlete competing in high jump. In 2006, he switched sporting allegiance, and then represented Great Britain.

Mason won silver and bronze medals at the World Junior Championships in 2000 and 2002. His first medal at senior level came at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, when he won a gold medal, having achieved a personal best jump of 2.34 meters. He finished fifth at the World Championships the same year.

Mason was eligible to represent Great Britain because his father David was born in London. Mason's mother persuaded him to switch allegiance, and Mason's change in nationality was ratified by athletics' governing body, the IAAF, in 2006.

Mason won a silver medal for Great Britain at the Beijing Olympics on 19 August 2008.

Mason died in a motorbike accident on 20 April 2017 at the age of 34.
