Wound

In medicine, a wound is a type of physical injury where in the skin is torn, cut or punctured (an "open" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a bruise (a "closed" wound). In pathology, it specifically means a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin. A mortal wound is one that leads directly to the death of the victim.

To heal a wound, the body undertakes a series of actions collectively known as the wound healing process.
