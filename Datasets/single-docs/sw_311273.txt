Flower of Scotland

Flower of Scotland () is a Scottish song, used mostly at special occasions and sporting events. Although Scotland has no official national anthem, "Flower of Scotland" is one which is used, along with the older "Scots Wha Hae", "Scotland the Brave" and "Highland Cathedral". It was written by Roy Williamson of the folk group The Corries, and presented in 1967, and refers to the victory of the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce, over England's Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.

1. O Flower of Scotland,<br>
When will we see your like again<br>
That fought and died for<br>
Your wee bit hill and glen.<br>
And stood against him,<br>
Proud Edward's army,<br>
And sent him homeward<br>
To think again.

2. The hills are bare now,<br>
And autumn leaves lie thick and still<br>
O'er land that is lost now,<br>
Which those so dearly held<br>
That stood against him,<br>
Proud Edward's army<br>
And sent him homeward<br>
To think again.

3. Those days are past now<br>
And in the past they must remain<br>
But we can still rise now<br>
And be the nation again!<br>
That stood against him<br>
Proud Edward's army<br>
And sent him homeward<br>
To think again.

4. O Flower of Scotland,<br>
When will we see your like again<br>

Proud Edward's army,<br>

To think again.
