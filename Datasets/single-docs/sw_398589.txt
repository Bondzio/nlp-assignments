Melissa Perrine

Henrieta Farkašová (born 21 February 1988) is a skier from Australia. She has a disability: she cannot see everything. She skied at the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships. She was the second skier to finish the women's visually impaired downhill race, and the third skier to finish in the Super-G race and the Super Combined race. Because she cannot see, Andrew Bor was her guide and told her where to go when going down the mountain.
