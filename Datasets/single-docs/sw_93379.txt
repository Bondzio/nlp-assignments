Rhein Erft Rural District

The Rhein-Erft-Kreis is a district in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

The district in its current borders was created in 1975, when the previous rural districts of Bergheim and Cologne were merged. On November 1, 2003 the district was renamed from "Erftkreis" to "Rhein-Erft-Kreis".

The main river in the district is the Erft, which also gave it the name. The Erft flows through the foothills of the Eifel, on the left side of the Rhine river.
