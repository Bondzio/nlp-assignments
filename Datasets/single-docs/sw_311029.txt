Yamashiro Province

Kyoto is in the former Yamashiro Province. 

In 794, the capital of Japan was in Yamashiro. It remained in the province until the Imperial court moved to Tokyo in the 1870s.

During the Muromachi Period, the administrative seat of the Ashikaga Shogunate was in this province. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Yamashiro Province were reformed in the 1870s.

The Kamo Shrines were the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") of Yamashiro. These are the Kamigamo Shrine and the Shimogamo Shrine.
