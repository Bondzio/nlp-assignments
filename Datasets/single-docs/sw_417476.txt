Leas Cliff Hall

Leas Cliff Hall is an entertainment and function venue in Folkestone, on the Kent coast of England.

The Leas Shelter was built in 1894. In 1924, it was decided that a larger hall was needed. 28 months later, the building was finished. It was opened on 13 July 1927 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.

The opening concert was performed by the Folkestone Municipal Orchestra. One thousand people attended.
It was closed for modernisation and refurbishment on 16 September 1980. It re-opened on 6 May 1981 in the form that it is today.
