Inverse function

An inverse function is a concept of mathematics. A function will calculate some output formula_1, given some input formula_2. This is usually written formula_3. The inverse function does the reverse. Let's say formula_4 is the inverse function of formula_5, then formula_6. Or otherwise put, formula_7. An inverse function to formula_8 is usually called formula_9 Do not confuse formula_10 with formula_11: the first is a value of an inverse function, the second is reciprocal of a value of a "normal" function.

Let's take a function formula_12 over real formula_2. Then, formula_14

Not all functions have inverse functions: for example, function formula_15 has none (because formula_16, and formula_17 should give both 1 and -1 when given 1)), but every binary relation has its own inverse relation.

Finding the inverse of a function can be very difficult to do.
