Reduction (chemistry)

Reduction is a chemical reaction that involves the gaining of electrons by one of the atoms involved in the reaction. The term refers to the element that accepts electrons, as the oxidation state of the element that gains electrons is lowered. 

An example of a reduction is when iron reacts with oxygen, forming a chemical called rust. In that example, the iron is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced.
