War (U2 album)

War is the third studio album by Irish rock band U2, released in 1983.

The band's first album, "Boy" is about childhood and the second album, "October" is about spirituality. This album is about war and politics. This is because of songs like "Sunday Bloody Sunday". The album was named "War" because of what was happening in the world while they were recording. Bono said that "everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war."

"War" sold well for the band right away. Michael Jackson's album, "Thriller" fell from the top of the charts. "War" became U2's first album in the United Kingdom to reach #1. It was not well liked by British critics at first, but over the years has gained approval.

U2 began recording "War" in May 1982. Bono and his bride Alison, had just been married. The band took a break while Bono and Alison went on a honeymoon in Jamaica. But Bono worked on the lyrics for the upcoming album while on vacation.

All of the songs and the lyrics were written by U2.
