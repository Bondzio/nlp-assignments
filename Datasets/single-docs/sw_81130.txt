Religious toleration

Religious toleration is people allowing other people to think or practice other religions and beliefs. In a country with a state religion, "toleration" means that the government allows other religions to be there. Many countries in past centuries allowed other religions but only in privacy. This has become rare. Others allow public religion but practice religious discrimination in other ways.
