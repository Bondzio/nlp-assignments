Spring

Spring is the season after winter and before summer. Days become longer and weather gets warmer in the temperate zone because the Earth tilts towards the Sun. In many parts of the world plants grow and flowers bloom. Often people with hay fever suffer more, because of the allergens. Many animals have their breeding seasons in spring.
In many parts of the world it rains for hours. This helps the plants grow and the flowers bloom.
At the start of spring, people suffering from seasonal affective disorder will feel better. Hay fever, however, often becomes worse.

Spring break is a vacation period in early spring at universities and schools in various countries in the world. Holidays celebrated in spring include Passover and Easter.
