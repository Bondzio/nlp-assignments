Pall Mall

Pall Mall is a street in the City of Westminster, London. It is parallel to The Mall. Pall Mall East leads into Trafalgar Square.

The street's name is taken from a game called 'pall mall'. The game was a mallet-and-ball game played in the early 17th century.

Pall Mall is probably best known for its many gentlemen's clubs.
