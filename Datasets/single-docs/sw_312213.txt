Electrical outlet

An electrical outlet or receptacle is a socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply. In buildings, electrical outlets are usually installed in the wall, although they can also be installed in the floor. Occasionally, they are found in the ceiling for powering devices such as garage door openers or neon signs in storefront windows. Different countries often have different outlet types and voltages. Adapters are available to convert between the different types.
