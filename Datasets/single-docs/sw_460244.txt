Multiple fruit

Multiple fruits arefruits that grow from more than one flower (called an "inflorescence"). Each flower in the inflorescence produces a fruit, and then these join together. There are also many multiple fruits that become dry later.

In languages other than English, the meanings of multiple and aggregate fruit are reversed.
