Flight of the Navigator

Flight of the Navigator is a science fiction movie from 1986. It was directed by Randal Kleiser and written by Mark H. Baker and Michael Burton. It is about David Freeman, a 12-year-old boy who is taken by an alien spaceship and finds himself caught in a world that has changed around him.

The producers of the movie at first sent it to Walt Disney Pictures in 1984. However, the studio was not able to approve it. It was sent to Producers Sales Organization. That studio made a deal with Disney to distribute the movie in the United States. The movie was partially filmed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Norway. It was a co-production with the Norwegian company "Viking Film".


The Trimaxion Drone Ship was rendered in CGI by Omnibus Computer Animation, under the supervision of Jeff Kleiser, the brother of director Randal Kleiser.

The music score for the movie was composed by Alan Silvestri. It is different from his other scores because it was completely electronically generated, using the Synclavier, one of the first digital multi-track recorders and samplers.
