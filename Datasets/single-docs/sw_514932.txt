Hamadryas baboon

The hamadryas baboon ("Papio hamadryas") is a species of baboon from the Old World monkey family. It is the northernmost of all the baboons. It lives in the Horn of Africa and the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. These regions have fewer natural predators than central or southern Africa, where other baboons live. 

The hamadryas baboon was a sacred animal in ancient Egypt.
