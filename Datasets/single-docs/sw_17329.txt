Cape Town

Cape Town is the legislative capital and the second biggest city of South Africa.

It is on the south-west coast. It has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate.

It was originally called the "Cape of Storms" by Bartolomeu Dias in 1486, a Portuguese explorer but was changed by King John II of Portugal to "Cape of Good Hope".

The city's most predominant feature is Table Mountain, a mountain with a flat top.
