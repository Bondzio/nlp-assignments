Haplorhini

The haplorhines, the "dry-nosed" primates (the Greek name means "simple-nosed"), are members of the Haplorhini clade: the prosimian tarsiers and all of the true simians. The simians are the catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes, including humans) and the platyrrhines (New World monkeys).
