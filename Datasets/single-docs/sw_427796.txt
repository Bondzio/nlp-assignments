Mister Donut

Mister Donut is a worldwide food franchise which sells pastries, soda, coffee, muffins and doughnuts. The company was established in the United States in 1956, though it is now based from Japan. The company was acquired in 1990, following which every North American outlet was renamed Dunkin' Donuts except for fewer than six by the start of 2010. Only one Illinois location continues using the "Mister Donut" corporate name.
