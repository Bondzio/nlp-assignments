Dodge Caravan

The Dodge Caravan is an American minivan manufactured by FCA US, LLC. and sold by Dodge. The Caravan was introduced around 1983, and Grand Caravan was introduced around 1987. The original Caravan was dropped after the 2007 model year and replaced by the Dodge Journey. Grand Caravan has been redesigned many times through the years. Chrysler announced that 2015 will be the last model year for the Grand Caravan, as part of the plan to refocus Dodge as a performance brand. However the Grand Caravan name might make a comeback for a later successor.
