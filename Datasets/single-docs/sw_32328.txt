Google Videos

Google Videos is a division of the search engine Google that searches video sharing websites (YouTube, Dailymotion, etc.) for search results. 

It is the successor to Google Video, a Google website that allowed people to upload videos through its servers so that they can be shared online. Google Video discontinued its service in August 2012, because of the high popularity of YouTube, which is a subsidiary of Google.
