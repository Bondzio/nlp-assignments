Ahmed Mohamed clock incident

Ahmed Mohamed is a 14-year-old student who was arrested in Irving, Texas in September 2015. The arrest happened after a teacher, and later the police mistook his home-made clock for a hoax bomb. His arrest caused a huge controversy.

US President Barack Obama invited him to The White House. President Obama and others complimented Mohamed for his inventive nature. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Hillary Rodham Clinton also gave him support.

His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, ran in the election for President of Sudan in 2010 and 2015. The elder Mohamed is the director of the Islamic Sufi Center in Texas.
