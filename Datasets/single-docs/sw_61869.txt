Brahmaputra River

The Brahmaputra, also called Tsangpo in Tibet, is one of the main rivers in Asia. It has its origin in the Himalayas of Tibet. It flows through Tibet, India and Bangladesh. It is long. Massive flooding occurs when the ice melts in the Spring.

The Brahmaputra’s source is the Chemayungdung Glacier, which covers the slopes of the Himalayas.

It joins with the Ganges river and empties into the Bay of Bengal and also forms the Gangetic delta, which is the largest delta in India.
