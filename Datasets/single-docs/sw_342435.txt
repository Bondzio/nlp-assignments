LGBT rights in Thailand

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Thailand may face legal challenges that non-LGBT residents don't have to. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Thailand. Same-sex couples and families headed by same-sex couples cannot get the same legal protections that opposite-sex couples can.
