Kevin Cosgrove

Kevin Michael Cosgrove (January 6, 1955 â€“ September 11, 2001) was an American businessman who died in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. He is best known for the 9-1-1 call that he made on September 11, 2001, which ended in him crying out from inside of the South Tower of the World Trade Center as it fell. He was born in Long Island, New York.

At the time of the September 11 attacks, Cosgrove was a Vice President of Claims for Aon Corporation, living in West Islip, New York.

Cosgrove was in the 105th floor of the South Tower when the attacks happened. He had two other people with him. One of these people, Doug Cherry, is mentioned by name in Cosgrove's 9-1-1 call. Cosgrove says, ""My wife thinks I'm all right, I called and said I was leaving the building and that I was fine, and then bang!"". Then, a 9-1-1 operator says, ""Hello?"". Cosgrove answered, ""Hello. We're looking in ... we're overlooking the Financial Center. Three of us. Two broken windows. Oh God. Oh-"" Cosgrove's words ended as the South Tower fell.

Cosgrove was found in the rubble after the attacks. He was buried on September 22, 2001 at St. Patrick Catholic Cemetery in Huntington, New York.
