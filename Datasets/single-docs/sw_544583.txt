Salt March

The "Dandi March" was part of the Indian independence movement. It was a non-violent protest against the salt tax by British government. The Indians were upset that the government increased the price of salt.

Mahatma Gandhi led the march. It started on March 12, 1930. It went from sabarmati Ashram to the village of Dandi. Marchers took a handful of salt from the shore. They then announced that they had broken the law by making salt. This was a major but peaceful challenge against Britain colony. This move enraged the British and called for his arrest.
