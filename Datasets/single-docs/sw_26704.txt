Anion

Anions are atoms or radicals (groups of atoms), that have gained electrons. Since they now have more electrons than protons, anions have a negative charge. For example, Chloride ions Cl- , Bromide Br- , Iodide I-. These are monovalent anions, meaning they have a combining capacity with only one ion of Hydrogen. Similarly there are bivalent anions, etc.

Anions are one of the two types of ions. The other type is called a cation, and have a positive charge. Ions are atoms that have an electrical charge.

Anions are termed so because they are attracted towards the Anode (the positive electrode). All Anions tend to accept a proton H+ thus they are categorized as bases. 

Anions are one of the type of ions we have,the other one is a cation. Anions are negatively charged,on the other hand cations are positively charged
