List of road routes in New South Wales

Major roads in New South Wales are organised into many routes. These help drivers to navigate their way between places in the state. Each route is given its own route number. The number consists of a letter] (M, A or B) and a one- or two-digit number. "M" routes are motorways, "A" routes are national routes, and "B" routes are state routes. The route system includes highways, motorways, and other important roads that have not been declared highways.

Route numbers have been allocated to roads in New South Wales since 1955. To supplement the national route number system, three "ring roads" were built in Sydney in 1964. These were numbered 1, 3 and 5. In 1973, a system of numbering freeways was introduced to New South Wales to complement the national routes and ring roads. In 1974, the National Highway network was defined, which in New South Wales included the Hume Highway, Federal Highway, Barton Highway, Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (now Pacific Motorway) and New England Highway. In 1993, Sydney's Metroad system was introduced.

In 2013, the state replaced its entire system of State Routes, National Routes, National Highways and Metroads with a new route numbering system of letters and numbers. The roads no longer uses National Highway shields on any route. This new system of routes are the routes that are listed below.
