Absurd (band)

Absurd is a national socialistic black metal band from Germany. The band was formed in 1992. Frontman of this band is Neo Nazi and former Satanist Hendrik Möbus

The band became notable after its (original) members murdered the 15-year-old Sandro Beyer in 1993. These members are no longer in the band. It is believed that Beyer knew of a relationship between Schauseil's and a married woman. She had been spreading rumors about this and other things the band was doing. On 29 April in Sondershausen, Möbus, Schauseil, and Kirchner met with Beyer. The strangled him there with an electrical cord. Kirchner was reported as saying: “Oh shit—now I’ve completely ruined my life.” Schauseil said he heard voices in his head saying "“Kuster Maier”". This made no sense but was interpreted by him as "“töte Beyer”" (‘kill Beyer’).
