Dawson City, Yukon

Dawson City is a place in the Yukon Territory. It used to be a city, but is not one anymore. It is the second-largest place in Yukon, after Whitehorse, and has 1,327 people. 

Dawson was at its biggest during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, and served as a base for mining. Many people became rich not from finding gold, but from running boarding houses/general stores because of good business from all of the miners. It was the capital of Yukon from 1898 to 1952.
