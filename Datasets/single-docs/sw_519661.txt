Nigella sativa

Nigella sativa is a black cumin (also known as nigella or "kalonji"). It is an annual flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is from south and southwest Asia. "Nigella sativa" can grow to be tall.

The black cumin fruit has numerous seeds which are used as spice, sometimes as a replacement for original black cumin "Bunium bulbocastanum". These two plants are both called 'black cumin' on account of their seeds.
