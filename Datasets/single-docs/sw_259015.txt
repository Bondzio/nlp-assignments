Vera Lynn

Dame Vera Lynn DBE (born March 20, 1917 in East Ham, Essex, England) is an English singer and actress. She was born Vera Margaret Welch. When she began performing in public at age seven, she adopted her grandmother's maiden name (Lynn) as her stage name. Her first radio broadcast, with the Joe Loss Orchestra, was in 1935. At this time she was being featured on records released by dance bands including those of Loss and of Charlie Kunz. 

She was popular during World War II. Her best known songs are We'll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover. 

Lynn has given much of her time and energy to working with charities for former military servicemen, disabled children, and breast cancer. She is still admired by veterans of the Second World War. She was named the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the twentieth century in 2000.

Vera Lynn's album "We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn" peaked #1 in the United Kingdom making her the oldest living artist to top the U.K. album charts. The album is some of her recordings made for Decca Records, for whom Lynn recorded between 1936 and 1959. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart on 13 September 2009. The album entered the chart at number 20 on 30 August, and then climbed to number 2 the following week, before reaching the top position.

The 1964 movie, Dr. Strangelove, starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, ends with a world-ending war of atomic bombs. The scene is accompanied by Vera Lynn's song "We'll Meet Again".
