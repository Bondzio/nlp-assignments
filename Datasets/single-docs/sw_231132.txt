Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award

The Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award is college football award given every year to the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision head coach whose team does well on the field, in the classroom, and in the community. The award is named for Bobby Dodd. Dodd was head football coach at Georgia Tech. The award was made in 1976 to honor the values that Dodd held. Coaches who win the award are chosen by a committee of college football experts and all previous winners. The winner is announced during half-time of the Chick-fil-A Bowl on December 31 in Atlanta, Georgia. A formal presentation is held later, usually on the university campus of the winner.

Only Joe Paterno of Penn State has received the award twice, in 1981 and in 2005. Four schools have had two different coaches given the award: Michigan with Bo Schembechler in 1977 and Lloyd Carr in 2007; Air Force with Ken Hatfield in 1983 and Fisher DeBerry in 1985, Georgia Tech with Bobby Ross in 1990 and George O'Leary in 2000 and TCU with Jim Wacker in 1984 and Gary Patterson in 2009.
