He first began playing football at the small club of Leiknir, before he started practicing at KR Reykjavík, Iceland's largest club. He spent most of his youth career at KR Reykjavik. His skill attracted interest from foreign clubs, and he eventually went to the Swedish club of Örgryte IS in 1995. Halfway through the season, he moved to Lillestrøm SK in Norway. Rúnar was a success there, and moved to K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen in Belgium in 2000.

He decided to move back to KR Reykjavík in 2007 to finish off his career. He took over as head coach at KR halfway through the 2010 season and managed the team for four seasons. During that time, KR Reykjavík won two league titles (2011 and 2013) and three cup titles (2011, 2012 and 2014). Rúnar left KR November 2014, to manage his former club Lillestrøm SK.

He has made a record 104 appearances for Iceland, along with 3 goals. He was captain of the team in 11 matches, but retired from international football in 2004.
