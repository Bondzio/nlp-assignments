Excellency

Excellency is a honorific style that is given to members of a certain organisation or state, usually a president or governor. Once a person gets the title of "Excellency" it is usually held by that person for the rest of their life though this is not always the case. For example some countries presidents get the title of "Excellency" but only hold it for their time in that office.
