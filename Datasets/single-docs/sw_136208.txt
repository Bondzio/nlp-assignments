Immigration

Immigration means people moving into a country to live. People who immigrate are called immigrants. Some are illegal immigrants. Some immigrants are refugees and some ask for political asylum. 

"Immigrant" and "emigrant" both describe human migration. The same people are "emigrants" when they leave their own country or region, and "immigrants" when they arrive somewhere else.

The phrases "many people emigrated from Europe in the 19th century AD to America" and "many people immigrated to America from Europe in the 19th century" have the same meaning.

As with other changes, people go to another place for several reasons:

Immigration has always been difficult. When people immigrate, they leave behind their friends, families, and culture. They also have to sell what they have, like a house, farm, or anything else too big to bring.

Travelling can also be very expensive. Many immigrants have to use all their money to pay fees or plane tickets.

Once immigrants arrive in the new countries, they can face many difficulties. They may have to get a job, find a house, and learn a new language. Immigrants can also be victims of racism.
