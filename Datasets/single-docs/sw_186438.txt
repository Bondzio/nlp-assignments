Blast fishing

Blast fishing or dynamite fishing is the use of dynamite or homemade bombs to kill or stun many fish at once. This makes the fish easier to catch. It kills many fish, and damages where they live. The explosions often destroys the habitat (such as coral reefs) which supports the fish. 

The explosives are also dangerous for the fishermen, causing accidents and injuries. The practice is illegal in many places.
