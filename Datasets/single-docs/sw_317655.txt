Letters to Juliet

Letters to Juliet is a 2010 American romantic comedy-drama movie. It stars Amanda Seyfried, Chris Egan, Vanessa Redgrave, Gael García Bernal, and Franco Nero. This was the final movie directed by Gary Winick before he died of brain cancer. The movie was released in North America and other countries on May 14, 2010. This movie was inspired by the 2006 non-fiction book, "Letters to Juliet", by Lise Friedman and Ceil Friedman.

When Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a young American, travels to Verona, Italy — the romantic city where Romeo first met Juliet — she meets a group of volunteers who respond to letters written to Juliet. Sophie finds and answers a letter that has been lost for 50 years, and is stunned when its author Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) arrives in Italy with her handsome but overprotective grandson (Christopher Egan) to find the fiance she left decades before.

Enchanted by Claire's quest, Sophie joins them on an adventure through the beautiful hills of Tuscany searching for Claire's long lost Lorenzo. The journey will change their lives forever, as they discover it's never too late to find true love.
