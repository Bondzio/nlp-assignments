Persian blue

The color Persian blue is named from the blue color of some Persian pottery and the color of tiles used in and on mosques and palaces in Iran and in other places in the Middle East. "Persian blue" is a representation of the color of the mineral lapis lazuli which comes from Persia and Afghanistan. (The color azure is also named after the mineral lapis lazuli.)

The first recorded use of "Persian blue" as a color name in English was in 1669.

The interior of the Shah Mosque in the city of Isfahan in Iran is lavishly decorated with Persian blue colored tiles.
