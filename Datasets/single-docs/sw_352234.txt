Acanthopleura granulata

Acanthopleura granulata, common name the West Indian fuzzy chiton, is a medium-sized tropical species of chiton.

This species is common within its range in the tropical Western Atlantic, but it is often not noticed, because its color and texture are similar to the rocks on which it lives.

In countries that used to be part of the British West Indies, these and other common intertidal chitons are known as "curb"; the foot of the animal is eaten by people and is also used as bait for fishing.

This species of chiton grows to be about 7 cm (3 inches) in length. The girdle is densely spiky and usually has a few black bands.

The surface of the valves (or plates) in this species is almost always quite heavily eroded, but when not eroded, the valve surface is granulated. The valves are thick and heavy.

This chiton occurs from southern Florida to Mexico, south to Panama, and in the West Indies.

This species lives on rocks very high in the intertidal zone. It can tolerate a lot of sun.
