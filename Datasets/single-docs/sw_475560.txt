Joshua Nkomo

Joshua Mqabuko Nyongolo Nkomo (19 June 1917 â€“ 1 July 1999) was the leader and founder of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and a member of the Ndebele (Kalanga) tribe. 

Nkomo was jailed for ten years by Rhodesia's white minority government. After his release, ZAPU contributed to the fall of that government. Then they fought with a rival group led by Robert Mugabe. Mugabe became President of Zimbabwe. Nkomo was not trusted and eventually fled the country.

In 1999 Nkomo was declared a National Hero. He is buried in the National Heroes Acre in Harare.

On 27 June 2000, a set of four postage stamps were issued with Nkomo's image.
