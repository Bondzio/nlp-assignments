Hearing

Hearing is one of the five senses. The ears are used for detecting (listening to) vibrations in the air known as sounds. Most animals can hear. Most land vertebrates hear through ears. Fish hear in several different ways. Many use their swim bladder to hear, and many use their lateral line. 

In mammals, sound travels through three main parts of the ear to be heard. These are the outer, middle and inner ear.
