Offensive guard

In American and Canadian football, a guard (G) is a player that lines up between the center and the tackles on the offensive line of a football team.

The guard's job is to protect the quarterback from the incoming defensive line and linebackers during pass plays, as well as creating openings (holes) for the running backs to run through.
