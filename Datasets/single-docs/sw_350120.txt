Kleomedes of Astypalia

Kleomedes of Astypalia was an Ancient Greek boxer. Using illegal tactics, he killed his opponent Ikkos in either the 71st or 72nd Olympic Games (496 or 492 BCE). What exactly occurred is not certain. He was disqualified though and heavily fined. Kleomedes was so angry he returned to his home town, and pulled out a post supporting a school roof. Many children were killed. The people stoned him. He ran into a temple and climbed into a chest. When the people opened it, he was gone. The oracle ordered the people to worship Kleomedes as a hero and a divinity.
