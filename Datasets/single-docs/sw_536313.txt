Allergic rhinitis

Allergic rhinitis (also known as hay fever or pollinosis) is a type of inflammation in the nose. It occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air. Symptoms include sneezing, red, itchy and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. 

Hay fever is typically caused by allergens, for example pollen, pet hair and mold.

Hay fever is most common between ages twenty and forty.
