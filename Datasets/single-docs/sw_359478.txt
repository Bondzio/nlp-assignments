Ghost frog

The Heleophrynidae is a family of frogs. They are commonly called ghost frogs. The family has two genera, "Heleophryne" and "Hadromophryne". There are seven species. Ghost frogs live in swift-moving mountain streams in South Africa. The common name of "ghost frogs" may be because they live in Skeleton Gorge.

Ghost frogs are medium sized frogs, reaching a length of . They have flat bodies. This lets them climb inside rocky crevices. They have very large toe discs in comparison to their size. This helps to hold onto rocks. The mouthparts of the tadpoles are a sucking disc. This lets them hold onto the surface they live on and remain still while they are feeding.

The ghost frogs are closely related to the Sooglossidae family, which inhabit the Seychelles. They may also be closely related to the Australian Myobatrachids.
