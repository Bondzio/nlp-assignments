Wheelbase

In both road and rail vehicles, the wheelbase is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.

Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle, wheelbase dimensions are very important to the balance and steering. In high performance vehicles a longer wheelbase is more stable at higher speeds. A short wheelbase vehicle is usually able to corner faster but may be less aerodynamic. The wheelbase, along with the track, affects a vehicle's steering angle (how sharply it can turn).

Wheelbase has an effect on a vehicle's turning radius (or turning circle). This is the smallest circle a car can turn or U-turn within. A long wheelbase car or truck cannot turn as sharply as a short wheelbase vehicle.

If the vehicle is towing a trailer (in British English a caravan) the weight distribution of the trailer is critical. If too much of the trailer's weight, called "tongue weight", presses down on the vehicle's tow hitch (more than 15 percent) it can cause the vehicle to go out of control. Too little tongue weight (less than 10 percent) can cause the trailer to sway from side to side. this in turn can make the vehicle difficult or even impossible to control. The shorter the wheelbase the more quickly these forces can cause a loss of control. A longer wheelbase vehicle is generally more desirable for towing. Each vehicle has a tow rating showing how much weight it can tow safely.
A vehicle's wheelbase is also important to the overall aesthetic appeal of a car design. Wheelbase is part of the balance and proportion of a car. Some Luxury vehicles are offered with long wheelbases to increase the spaciousness and luxury of the vehicle. This is found most often on full-size cars. In contrast, coup√© varieties of the some vehicles such as the Honda Accord are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the sedans they are based on.
