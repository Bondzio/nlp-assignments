Lake Ontario

Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes in North America. 

It is found on the border between Canada and the United States of America. Its inlet is the Niagara River (from Niagara Falls), and its outlet is the Saint Lawrence River. Nearly 9 million Canadians live near Lake Ontario. It is also the only Great Lake that does not touch the U.S. state of Michigan, the "Great Lakes State".
