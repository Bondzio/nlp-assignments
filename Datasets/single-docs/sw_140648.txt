Zoophilia

Zoophilia (or zoosexuality) is a type of paraphilia. People who have it feel sexually attracted to animals. These people are called zoophiles. Sexual activity with an animal is called bestiality. It is illegal in most countries. Most people think that zoophilia is wrong. Zoophilia is a mental disorder in the DSM.

In a 1974 study, 4.9% of males said they had had sexual interactions with animals.
