WWE 2K15

WWE 2K15 is a professional wrestling video game. It was being developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts. It was published by 2K Sports. 

The game was released on October 28, 2014 in North America. It was released on October 31, 2014 in Europe. The game will be available on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. It was the first game in the "WWE 2K" series to be released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. 

WWE 2K15 is the first attempt in the series at a next-generation game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Justin Gabriel released a photo on his official Instagram of himself getting "scanned" for what appears to be the Eco-Motion engine that was used in "NBA 2K14"'s next generation game. Former "NXT" Chris Hero (Kassius Ohno) also did some motion-captioning for the game.

2K's community manager, Ronnie Singh described the Eco-Motion engine as "One example of the Eco-Motion Engine in action is the new fluid nature of player animations. Gone are the days of pre-canned animations that must play out exactly as they were mocapped. Now, players adjust their movements based on the environment around them."
