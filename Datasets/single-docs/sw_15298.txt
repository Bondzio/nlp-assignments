1582

Gregorian calendar switch: The year 1582 (MDLXXXII) involved conversion to the Gregorian calendar. It had only 355 days. It began as a common year starting on Monday, in accordance with the Julian calendar. It continued as normal through Thursday, October 4. But the next day, it became October 15 (like a common year starting on Friday) in Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Other countries continued to use the Julian calendar, switching over to the Gregorian in later years.
