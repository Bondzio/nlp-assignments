Family (biology)

In biology, a family is a taxonomic rank, or a taxon at that rank. Each family contains one or more genera. The next important rank is that of order. Usually, the name of the family ends with a "idae" for animals, and ""aceae"" for plants. Sometimes there are also subfamilies and superfamilies. Subfamilies end with "inae" or ""oideae"".

In Latin, family is "familia". 

For example, walnuts (genus "Juglans") and hickories (genus "Carya") both belong to the walnut family (the "Juglandaceae").
