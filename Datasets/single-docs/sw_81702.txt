Rashomon

The movie is based on two short stories by RyÅ«nosuke Akutagawa.

The fictional plot is set in Japan in the Heian period.
There is a murder and rape in a forest: these things happen to different characters.
The movie is famous for having an unusual type of story. The same event is described differently by the four different people involved in it. Most movies describe the same things in one way during the entire movie. The four people said different things. The movie does not say which person is right.

The 1964 movie "The Outrage" was a remake of "Rashomon". Kurosawa was acknowledged for the screenplay. The movie's concept is also mirrored in many other movies, including "Hero", "Vantage Point", "Courage Under Fire" and "Basic".
