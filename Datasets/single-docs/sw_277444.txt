Ragnar Granit

Ragnar Arthur Granit (30 October, 1900 in Riihimäki, Finland — 31 March 1990, in Stockholm, Sweden) was a Finnish-Swedish doctor and scientist. He won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the eye.

His father was a forester, Arthur Wilhelm Granit, and his mother was Albertina Helena Malmberg Granit. Granit married Baroness Marguerite Emma Bruun ("Daisy") in 1929. Their son Michael Granit (b. 1930) is an architect.

For his research into the internal electrical impulses that take place as the eye processes vision, Ragnar Granit was given the 1967 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology.

Granit received Swedish citizenship during World War II, and once said that his Nobel Prize "belongs fifty-fifty to Finland and Sweden".
