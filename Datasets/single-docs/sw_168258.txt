Puget Sound

Puget Sound is a sound in Western Washington. It is a large area of salt water that is partially cut off from the rest of the Pacific Ocean. Many of Washington's cities, like Seattle and Tacoma are next to the sound. Many boats travel on the sound. Some of the boats are Ferries which take people from the main part of Washington to the islands in the sound. Many boats come from across the Ocean from places like Japan, and China to trade in Washington.
