Chościsko – according to of Gall of Anonym father of Hubs and, of progenitor of dynasty Piastów. His name meaning the tail probably (from " chost/chwost") appears in for Polish Chronicle in this meaningskutkować three times: Chościskiem also a prince is named Popiel in the title of chapter first of the first book. It is likely that they used the name here in the role of the nickname or it stayed added to the manuscript in the more late period.
