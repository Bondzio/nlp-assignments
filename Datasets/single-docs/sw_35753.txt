Euler's identity

Euler's identity, sometimes called Euler's equation, is this equation:

formula_1

formula_7

Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler. It is not clear that he invented it himself. 

Respondents to a "Physics World" poll called the identity "the most profound mathematical statement ever written", "uncanny and sublime", "filled with cosmic beauty" and "mind-blowing".

Many equations can be written as a series of terms added together. This is called a Taylor series

The Exponential function formula_8 can be written as the Taylor series 

formula_9

As well, Sine can be written as

formula_10

and Cosine as

formula_11

Here, we see a pattern take form. formula_12 seems to be a sum of sine and cosine's Taylor Series, except with all of the signs changed to positive. The identity we are actually proving is formula_13.

So, on the left side is formula_14, whose Taylor series is formula_15

We can see a pattern here, that every second term is i times sine's terms, and that the other terms are cosine's terms.

On the right side is formula_16, whose Taylor series is the Taylor series of cosine, plus i times the Taylor series of sine, which can be shown as:

formula_17

if we add these together, we have 

formula_15

Therefore:

formula_13

Now if we replace x with formula_2, we have..


Then we know that

and
Therefore:

QED
