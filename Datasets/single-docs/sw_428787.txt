Division of Macarthur

The Division of Macarthur is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It is named after John Macarthur and his wife Elizabeth, who were both pioneers of Australia's wool industry. 

It covers the outer south-west of Sydney. It includes the suburbs of Airds, Ambarvale, Appin, Badgerys Creek, Bickley Vale, Bradbury, Camden, Camden South, Campbelltown, Cawdor, Cobbitty, Ellis Lane, Gilead, Glen Alpine, Grasmere, Greendale, Harrington Park, Kentlyn, Mount Annan, Narellan, Oran Park, Rosemeadow, Rossmore, St Helens Park, Wedderburn and Woodbine and parts of Bringelly, Catherine Field, Douglas Park, Leumeah, Razorback and Rossmore.

Over the years the size of the electorate has become much smaller. This is because of the increasing number of people living in the Campbelltown region. The towns of Bowral and Moss Vale and a large part of the Southern Highlands were removed from the division before the 2001 election.
