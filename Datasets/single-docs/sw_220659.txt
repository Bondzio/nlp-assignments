Blackberry pie

Blackberry pie is pie made of blackberry filling, most of the time in the form of either blackberry jam, blackberries themselves, or sometimes both. Blackberries must be stewed or soaked in water before baking to stop burning. Fresh frozen blackberries sweetened with brown sugar nestled under a double crust and served with ice cream is usually eaten in summer, and many people enjoy it as a summer favorite.

When Abraham Lincoln was made President of the United States in 1861, blackberry pie was served at the inauguration lunch.
