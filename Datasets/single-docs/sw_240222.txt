Design management

Design management is not independent from the organization and product context, and plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organisation and market:

Supportive activities are used in design management to manage design more efficient ('doing the things right') and effectively ('doing the right things').

It is difficult to exactly trace the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created the context in which design management could arise. Throughout its history design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines (e.g. architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering) and movements (e.g. system theory, design methodologies) and in its understanding it can be attributed neither directly to design nor to management.
