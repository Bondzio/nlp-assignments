Logo of Wikipedia

The logo of Wikipedia, which is a free Internet-based multi-language encyclopedia, is a picture that shows the following description:

A cut globe made from Jigsaw puzzle pieces with some missing at the top, and has glyphs from many different writing systems. 

As shown on the web pages of the English-language version of Wikipedia, it says "Wikipedia" under it, and there's a text that says "The Free Encyclopedia", in the free open-source font.
