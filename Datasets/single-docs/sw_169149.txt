Trap door

A trap door is a door in the ground or in a floor that opens when someone stands on it. Trap doors are popular in mystery themed movies. The victim who falls down the trap door often is met with danger or a hidden treasure. A standard clich√© deals with the victim finding himself in an alligator filled swamp (most famously seen in "Scooby Doo" cartoons).
