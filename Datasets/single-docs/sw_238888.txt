Cool Silly

Cool Silly () is a Taiwanese-American mainstream pop trio consisting of producer/singer Tone (), singer/composer Ray Liu () and rapper/actor Leeway(). Renowned artist Tone () formed his own band after releasing his first debut album titled "我的6:57am", and recruited the other two members to form Cool Silly. They are well known throughout Taiwan with their hit "Fly" (), which was the theme song for the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition (). The song attracted many fans, which led to Cool Silly's debut in 2010 with the release of their first digital album, Cool Silly: The Prelude. Since their debut, they have often been compared with the Popular Taiwanese rock group, F.I.R., because of the similar formation of band members and attractive performance personalities.

The name Cool Silly comes from the band's ideology that "a person can't be cool unless they're silly as well". The band insists that the personality of their music is not only "cool" but "silly" as well.
