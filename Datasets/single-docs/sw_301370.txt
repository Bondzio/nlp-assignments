Greater Noida

Greater Noida (GN) (, , pronunciation: Baṛa Nōēḍā) is in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). It is under the control of the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. It is about south-east of New Delhi and about south-east of Noida, one of the largest industrial townships in Asia.

The development of Greater Noida is managed by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). Greater Noida is a fast growing region.

In the early 1980s, Delhi was growing at a rapid rate. The Government of India planned to develop two new areas around the capital. These residential and industrial areas would reduce the burden on the capital. The two areas were Gurgaon and Noida. Noida's infrastructure and utilities was carefully designed. With the large growth of the Indian economy in the 1990s, Noida became overcrowded.

The government of Uttar Pradesh decided to incorporate the city of Greater Noida. This would be an extension to Noida. The planning of Greater Noida would be improved from what was learned in Noida. Greater Noida is a planned township. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. All cabling and utilities are run underground. 

The Buddh International Circuit is currently under construction. It is scheduled to open in 2011. It will host the Indian Grand Prix, a new race to the Formula One schedule. This will be the first F1 race in India.
