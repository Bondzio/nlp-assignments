Zomi Revolutionary Army

The Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) is a nationalist separatist group dedicated to the defense of ethnic Zomi people. It fights for the reunification of Zomi people, whose homelands are split between in Myanmar (Chin State), Bangladesh (Chittagong Hill Tracts) and North-east India (Manipur and Mizoram). It aims to unite all Zomi people under one governing unit, known as a Zogam, meaning "land of the Zomi".
