Cerberus

Kerberos (Latin Cerberus) is a creature in Greek mythology, like a hound (dog) with three heads. It belongs to Hades, and it guards the gate of the Greek underworld. Cerberus is a Hellhound and is related to another mythical animal, the Chimera (part goat, part lion, part snake).
Cerberus makes sure the dead stay within the gates and the living stay away from them. However, the Greeks did note in their myths that Cerberus was a fan of sweet things like honey cakes (The myth of Eros and Psyche) and music (The myth of Orpheus in the Underworld).
Another way to become friends with the animal was to talk to his owner, Hades, the Lord of the Underworld (The labours of Hercules).Cerbus is the son of Typhon and echidna.
