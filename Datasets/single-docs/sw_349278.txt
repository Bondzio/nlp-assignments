The Glass House (2012 TV series)

The Glass House will be an American reality television series in which people who signed up get to tell the people what to do. Fourteen contestants will live in the house and compete for $250,000. The premiere will be on June 18, 2012.

On May 4, 2012, broadcasting company CBS told ABC not to air "The Glass House". This was because CBS thought it was the same as their reality television series "Big Brother". Nineteen people who used to work on "Big Brother" are working on "The Glass House". On May 10, 2012, CBS started a lawsuit against ABC.
