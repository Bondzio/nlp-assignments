Hizen Province

Hizen had borders with the provinces of Chikuzen and Chikugo.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Saga.

The name "Hizen" dates from the Nara Period, when the province was divided from Higo Province. The name appears in the "Shoku Nihongi".

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Hizen Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Kawakami jinja" and "Chiriku Hachiman-gÅ«" were the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") of Hizen.
