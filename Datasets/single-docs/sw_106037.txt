Minnesota Vikings

The Minnesota Vikings (also known as the worlds biggest chokers) are a professional American football team in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Vikings play in the National Football Conference of the National Football League (NFL). They have been part of the North Division. The Vikings have won their division 16 times, which is the third most among teams that are playing in the NFL now. They appeared in four Super Bowls during the 1970s, and lost all four of them.

The team is called the Vikings because the state of Minnesota was settled by a great many people of Scandinavian ancestry. The historical Vikings originated in Scandinavia.
