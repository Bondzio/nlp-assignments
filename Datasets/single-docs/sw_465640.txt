Five Nights at Freddy's

Five Nights at Freddy’s is an indie survival horror video game. It was made by Scott Cawthon and is powered by Clickteam Fusion. The game takes place in the fictional pizza restaurant, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The player acts as a night security guard with the aim of keeping safe from the animatronic animal characters that are "malfunctioning". To complete the levels of the game, the player must keep the antagonists away from the guard's office, using mechanical doors, lights, and a CCTV camera panel. The animatronic characters in the first game of the series are named Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Golden Freddy.

The game series has a complicated and heavily hidden storyline that has sparked thousands of fan-made theories around the world, with the main goal being a reliable "timeline" of the events and characters in the series. Scott Cawthon, the sole developer of the Five Nights at Freddy's games, has stated that nobody has figured out a completely accurate conclusion of the story. 

In November 2014, a prequel, "Five Nights at Freddy's 2" was released. In 2015, "Five Nights at Freddy's 3" and "Five Nights at Freddy's 4" were released. A Five Nights at Freddy's RPG called FNAF World was released on 2016. A fifth game, "" was released the same year.

"Five Nights at Freddy’s" is installed an estimated 4,694 times per day, earning a daily revenue of $12,879. Cawthon has given away $256,499 to a charity livestream, surpassing the initial goal of $15,000.
