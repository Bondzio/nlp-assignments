Tim Farron

Tim Farron (born 27 May 1970) is a British politician who has been the Member of Parliament for Westmorland and Lonsdale since 2005. Farron was the leader of the Liberal Democrats until his announced resignation in June 2017.

From 2011 to 2015, Farron served as president of the Liberal Democrats. He became popular in the party because he did not vote for higher university tuition fees.

After the heavy Liberal Democrat party losses in the 2015 election, Nick Clegg resigned as party leader. This caused a leadership election to be held. Farron beat his rival Norman Lamb and was elected leader.

Farron resigned as Lib Dem leader after the 2017 general election.
