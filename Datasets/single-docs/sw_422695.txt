God's will

God's will, an idea in Abrahamic religions, is what God wants to happen. Christians, Jews and Muslims believe that they should do God's will. In the Bible, God's will is that all people will turn to him (repent) from their sins and live with him forever, in Heaven. Christians believe that in order to do this, they must accept Jesus, God's son, into their lives. Different Christians have different interpretations of what God's will is.
