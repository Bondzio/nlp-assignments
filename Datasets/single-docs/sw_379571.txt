Blackgate Prison

Blackgate Prison is a fictional prison where normal prisoners are taken into jail. The prison is off the coast of Gotham Bay which is like Alcatraz Island. In other cases the prison is in the city such as in "The Dark Knight Rises".

Unlike Arkham Asylum, many people like Rupert Thorne, Carmine Falcone, The Penguin, Ventriloquist, and Victor Zsasz are held. The prison was in "The Dark Knight Rises" when Bane used the Batmobile to shot the prison open to free all the prisoners to occupy Gotham.
