Michio Kaku

Dr. Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist who is well renowned on the Science Channel, particularly for Sci-Fi Science. He is known as a "sci-fi fan" on the SC.

Michio was born in San Jose, California. As a child, he took judo lessons. When he grew older, he graduated from college with a summa cum laude degree.

Michio is famous for his major field, theoretical physics.

Sci-fi is another field Michio studied. Some episodes of Sci-Fi Science, for instance, ponder alien invasion of the planet, or a new solar system.

The string theory is another thing that Kaku studied.

Michio continues to study theoretical physics, and release new Sci-Fi Science episodes.

A futurist is a notable scientist who can seemingly predict the future. Futurists often use PPPW to evaluate the future. The "three Ps and one W" represent, to futurists, "plausible", "possible", and "preferable". The "W" stands for "wildcard"(random) events.

A science popularizer, or a popularizer of science, is one who captures the scientific method and accuracy to preserve the language in the name of science.

Michio Kaku was also a famous author. He wrote books such as Physics of the Impossible and Hyperspace, Beyond Einstein, and Parallel Worlds.
