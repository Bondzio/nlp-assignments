Volkswagen First Act

Volkswagen First Act is a guitar created by first act in partnership with Volkswagen.

Volkswagen initiated a campaign in 2006 in which the company gave away special edition First Act guitars along with a special series car. The stereos in these Volkswagen could be used as an amplifier for the guitar. An accompanying ad campaign featured guitarists Slash, John Mayer, and Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap playing First Act guitars through the sound systems of Volkswagen automobiles.
