LGBT rights in Alaska

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons living in the U.S. state of Alaska are able to marry. A U.S. district court declared Alaska's denial of same-sex marriages unconstitutional on October 12, 2014.

State law does not address hate crimes based on gender identity or sexual orientations. Anchorage, however, does have an ordinance "to outlaw discrimination in Anchorage based on sexual orientation or gender identity". Anchorage makes up 41% of the total population of Alaska.
