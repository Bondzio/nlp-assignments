Walls of Ávila

The Walls of Ávila in central Spain were completed between the 11th and 12th centuries. They are the city's principal historic feature.

The enclosed area is a rectangle of with a perimeter of some , including 90 semicircular crenellated towers. The walls have an average width of . They have an average height of . The wall has nine fortified gates. The Puerta de San Vicente (Gate of St Vincent) and Puerta del Alcazar (Gate of the Fortress) are flanked by twin towers, high, linked by a semicircular arch. The apse of the cathedral also forms one of the towers. The fortifications are the most complete in Spain.

It is possible to walk on the walls for about half their circumference. Some of the walls will never be able to be walked on because they are connected to other buildings. There is a large section of the walls that have not been made safe for people.

The site was registered as a National Monument in 1884. In 1985, the old city of Ávila and its extramural churches were declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.

The walls were one of finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.
