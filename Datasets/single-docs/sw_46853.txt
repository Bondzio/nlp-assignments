Link (unit)

A link, also called a Gunterâ€™s link, is a unit of length in the imperial and US systems. Links were commonly used in measuring land in the English-speaking world before the 20th century, but are now rarely used. "Link" is usually abbreviated as "l.", "li." or "lnk." It was invented by Edward Gunter (1581-1626), a professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, the same man who made the chain. He made the link as a low technology piece of equipment that could survey small areas of land very accurately, whereas the chain could measure towns and large areas of land. 
It is used rarely nowadays, but is sometimes used in agriculture, like the chain. It is exactly like the small metal loops in a chain, and is therefore called a link.
