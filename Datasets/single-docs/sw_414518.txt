Burger Beard is on an island near Binkini Bottom, searching for a book. He finds one and takes it but a Skeleton kicks him off the island and to the boat. The book reveals that it's about SpongeBob SquarePants, which the seagulls sing its theme song. Burger Beard keeps reading the book.
Burger Beard says that SpongeBob loved The Krusty Krab more than Gary, Patrick, blowing bubbles, and jellyfishing. Then he tells that people wonder what's the secret formula because they eat it every time of the day, and no one cared except Plankton because the food was bad. So he always plans to steal the secret formula, but SpongeBob was always there to protect it.
After noticing Plankton drop Tartar Sauce, Mr. Krabs suggests that he wants a food fight. SpongeBob tells Patrick to load the potatoes, so he loads them, causing Plankton's plane to crash. His plane turns into a tank, Plankton loads pickles. SpongeBob wants Mr. Krabs' orders and he says: "Extra ketchup, extra mustard, hold the mayo!". SpongeBob uses ketchup and mustard, and Patrick holds mayo. As SpongeBob was shooting the ketchup and mustard, the mayo got so heavy that Patrick didn't want to hold it anymore.
