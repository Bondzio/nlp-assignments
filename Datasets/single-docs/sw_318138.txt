Vanuatu at the Olympics

Vanuatu was first at the Olympic Games in 1988. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then. The nation has never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

As of 2011, no ni-Vanuatu athlete has ever won an Olympic medal.

The National Olympic Committee for Vanuatu was formed in 1987 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year.
