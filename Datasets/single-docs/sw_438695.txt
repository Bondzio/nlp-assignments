Division of Fairfax

The Division of Fairfax is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was set up in 1984 and is named after Ruth Fairfax, founder of the Country Women's Association. It is covers the Sunshine Coast region north of Brisbane and includes the towns of Buderim, Coolum, Eumundi, Kenilworth, Mapleton, Maroochydore, Montville, Nambour, Palmwoods, Peregian Springs, Woombye and Yandina.

In the 2013 election, mining millionaire and leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer won the seat by 36 votes at the first count. This was reduced to 7 votes after a recount of the distribution of preferences. Because this was less than 100 votes, the Australian Electoral Commission counted all the votes again which gave Palmer a win by 53 votes.
