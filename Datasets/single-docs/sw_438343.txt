Langar

The langar (, ) is a common kitchen where food is served at a Sikh temple ("gurdwara"). One is attached to every temple, and the food is served to all the visitors for free. At the langar, only vegetarian food is served. It is usually bread (poori), yogurt and lentils. Samosas and spring rolls are served on special occasions. Kheer may be served as a dessert.

The langar is open to both Sikhs and people who are not Sikhs. After a person eats at the langar they are not supposed to eat meat for the rest of the day.
