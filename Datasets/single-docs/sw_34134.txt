War in Afghanistan (2001â€“14)

The War in Afghanistan refers to a war waged by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, The Netherlands, Australia and other countries against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. In 2016 the last NATO troops were withdrawn. 1908 NATO soldiers were killed in Afghanistan: 1,162 American, 313 British and 433 Other Coalition countries' soldiers were killed in this war. More than 15,000 Coalition soldiers were wounded: 6,773 US, 3,954 UK, 1,500 Canadian and over 2,500 other Coalition soldiers. 5,500 Afghan army soldiers and 200 Northern Alliance militants were killed in this war. 378 US civilian contractors were killed and 7,224. British troops left Afghanistan in 2015, after 5 years of training the Afghanistan police to deal with threats from the Taliban.

Formal cessation took place on 28 December 2014 via a ceremony in the city of Kabul thus ending the 13 year long war. Thousands of American and other troops continued helping the Afghan government until December 31, 2016 when they were withdrawn.
