Media player

Media player is a word that describes computer software that can play more than one type of media (multimedia). Media players can usually play both audio (sound) and video files.

Microsoft Windows comes with a media player already on it, Windows Media Player. Some other media players are Quicktime, iTunes, Real Player and Winamp.

Many media players use libraries. The library helps you organize, or catalog, your music into categories such as genre, year, rating or other. Good examples of media players that include media libraries are Winamp, Windows Media Player, iTunes, RealPlayer, Amarok and ALLPlayer.
