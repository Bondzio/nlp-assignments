Judith Miller (journalist)

Judith Miller is an American conservative journalist. She was born January 2, 1948. She worked for the New York Times until retiring from there around November 2005. She later became a contributor to Fox News and then a contributing writer for a conservative magazine called "Newsmax".

Her coverage of Iraq's alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program both before and after the 2003 invasion generated much controversy. A number of stories she wrote while working for "The New York Times" later turned out to be inaccurate or simply false.<
