Moulana Mohammad Ali Johar (10 December 1878 â€“ 4 January 1931) was an Indian Muslim leader, activist, scholar, journalist and poet. He was born on 10 December 1878 in Rampur. He belonged to a pathan tribe of Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa. He studied at the famous Muslim institutes, Darul Uloom Deoband and Aligarh Muslim University.

He travelled to England in 1919 to stop the deposition of the Turkish Sultan, Mustafa Kemal who was the Caliph of Islam. The rejection of British started the Khilafat Movement by the Muslims. In 1921 he actively brought Muslims together against the British rule and was thus put in jail for 2 years.

He became president of Indian National Congress in 1923. He opposed the Nehru Report as he did not want British or Hindu leadership and thus supported the Fourteen points of Quaid-e-Azam.

He was buried at Baitul Muqaddas in Jerusalem upon his will.
