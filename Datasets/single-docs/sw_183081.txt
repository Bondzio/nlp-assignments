Subscription

A subscription is a product or service which is paid for periodically, rather than all at once. Magazines and newspapers are often subscription products, while things like internet connections or cable television are examples of subscription services. Subscriptions fees are usually charged for a consistent time period, typically in weeks, months, or years.
