Right Livelihood Award

The Right Livelihood Award, widely known as the Alternative Nobel Prize, is a major international award to honour those "working on practical and exemplary solutions to the most urgent challenges facing the world today". The prize was started in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, and is presented each year in early December. An international jury, invited by the five regular Right Livelihood Award board members, decides the awards in such fields as environmental protection, human rights, sustainable development, health, education, and peace. The prize money is shared among the winners, usually numbering four, and is EUR 200,000.

The prize has been awarded to a diverse group of people and organisations, including Mycle Schneider, Amory Lovins, Astrid Lindgren, Bianca Jagger, Mordechai Vanunu, and Petra Kelly.
