Jack T. Chick

Jack Thomas Chick (April 13, 1924 â€“ October 23, 2016) was an American publisher, writer, and comic book artist. He mainly wrote evangelical Christian fundamentalist tracts and comic books. His comics have been described as hate literature by the "Los Angeles Magazine". He was born in Los Angeles, California.

Chick's company, Chick Publications, claims to have sold over 750 million tracts, comics tracts and comic books, videos, books, and posters designed to spread Protestant evangelism from a fundamentalist Christian point of view. Many of his tracts are controversial. For example, some of the tracts accuse Roman Catholics, Freemasons, Muslims and many other groups of murder and conspiracies. Chick says his views are just not politically correct.

His views have been spread around the world, mostly through the tracts and now online. They have been translated into more than 100 languages. Chick is an Independent Baptist who follows a premillennial dispensationalist view of the end times. He is an firm believer in the King James Only movement, which says that every English translation of the Bible more recent than 1611 promotes heresy.

Chick tracts are used to spread Evangelicalism and evangelical Christian ideas. The most known of tracts is This Was Your Life!, which was made in 1964. They are known for spreading fundamentalist beliefs and even banned in some countries as hate literature. Some of his tracts are shown in the Smithsonian Institution.

Chick died on October 23, 2016 in Los Angeles from complications of diabetes, aged 92.
