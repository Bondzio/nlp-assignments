Smooth endoplasom reticulum

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or smooth ER, is an organelle found in both animal cells and plant cells. Smooth ER helps the body make and metabolize fats and steroid hormones.

There are two types of endoplasmic reticuli: smooth and rough.

Rough ER is studded with ribosomes. Smooth ER is not.
