Italian Peninsula

The Italian Peninsula (or Apennine Peninsula; , "Penisola appenninica") is a large peninsula of Southern Europe. It extend into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Ionian and Adriatic Seas on the east and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is located between two larger peninsulas, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. Because of the peninsula's shape, it is nicknamed "Lo Stivale" ("The Boot"). Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (the "toe"), Salento (the "heel") and Gargano (the "spur").

The peninsula is about long, starting from the Po Valley in the north. The Apennine Mountains cover most of its length. It has mainly a Mediterranean climate, though in the mountainous parts the climate is much cooler.

Since the reign of Roman Emperor Augustus (end of 1st century BC), the northern border of the peninsula has been set on the Alps drainage basin. Geographically, however, its northern end runs from the Magra to the Rubicon rivers, north of the Apennines in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. This definition does not include the Po Valley or the southern slopes of the Alps.

Nearly all of the peninsula is part of the Italian Republic, apart from San Marino and the Vatican City.
