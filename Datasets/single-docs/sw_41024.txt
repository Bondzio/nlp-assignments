Respiration

During respiration energy is released in a form that can be used by cells. All living things respire. Both plant and animal cells use the process of respiration to release energy from glucose.

There are two types of respiration. One is aerobic respiration and the other is anaerobic respiration. Breaking down of food in presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration, whereas breaking down food in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic respiration. 


Respiration takes place in a special structure called the mitochondria inside all eukaryote cells.

See these (in this order) for an outline of the biochemistry of aerobic respiration:
