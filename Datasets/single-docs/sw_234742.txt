Royal Canadian Mounted Police

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), ( (GRC)), is the national police force of Canada. The force is also called the "Mounties".

RCMP is unique in the world because it is a national, federal, provincial and municipal policing organization: 

The RCMP/"GRC" wording is protected under the Canadian Trade-marks Act.

The Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP), was founded 1873. The Mounties were created to establish authority and to make accommodations with the native population in the west before settlers began to arrive.

The Mounties were given the right to use the term "Royal" by King Edward VII in 1904. 
Today's RCMP is the result of a reoganisation in 1920.
