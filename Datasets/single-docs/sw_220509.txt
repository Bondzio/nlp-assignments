Star Trek: The Animated Series

Star Trek is an animated American science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry that is based on and contiunes the story of the original series. The animated series was aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become more known under this longer name (or abbreviated as "ST: TAS" or "TAS") to make it different from the original live action "." The success of the original live action series and fan pressure for a "Star Trek" revival led to "The Animated Series" from 1973-1974, as the source of new adventures of the "Enterprise" crew, the next being the live-action feature movie 1979's "". "TAS" was the first "Star Trek" series to win an Emmy Award.
