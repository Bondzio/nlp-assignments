Freedom of Worship (Norman Rockwell)

Freedom of Worship is a painting of Norman Rockwell and is one of his series of four paintings called the "Four Freedoms". Rockwell was inspired to make these paintings since he heard the "Four Freedoms Speech" of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt of January 6, 1941.

This painting was made public in "The Saturday Evening Post" of February 27, 1943, along with an essay of Will Durant. The other paintings of the "Four Freedoms" series are "Freedom of Speech", "Freedom from Want" and "Freedom from Fear", and were shown in other editions of the paper.it is a very good pintor(norman Rockwell)

Rockwell needed various attempts to end up with this version of the painting. Former versions showed a number of customers in a barbershop, all with another religious and racial background. He found it to be difficult to make clear images that showed how a person of a certain religion looks like. He finally chose a neutral location where people of different race worship in their own religion. He took Vermont neighbors as models for his series.

The paintings toured through the United States with the motto "Buy War Bonds". All together 1.2 million Americans saw the paintings and 132 million dollar was collected to be used in World War II.

The painting can be found in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
