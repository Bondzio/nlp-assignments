Staffordshire Bull Terrier

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is an English dog breed. It is a medium-sized dog, originally it was bred for dog fighting. It is related to the bull terrier. Its appearance is similar to the American Staffordshire Terrier and American pit bull terrier, but it is smaller than both of them. It grows to a wrist height of 12-17cm, and a weight of about 11-17kg. 

In Great Britain the dog is often kept as a "family dog". Staffordshire Bull Terriers have been trained as search and rescue dogs.

In other countries, such as Germany, this dog breed is seen as problematic; these countries may have put restrictions in place regarding the breeding and keeping such dogs. The people keeping such dogs may need to undergo tests to determine whether they are allowed to keep the dog. Most people think that this type of dog is very dangerous but they are not. They are actually really kind and love babies and small children. They usually have a bad name because people train them to be bad. 

They are also one of the cutest dogs in the world.
