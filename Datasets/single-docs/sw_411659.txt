Sekai no Owari

The origin of this band's name is that when Fukase broke down and felt like end of the world, he realized he only had music and friends. So, he thought he would start from end and named his band "SEKAI NO OWARI"

They are friends from preschool to high school,but Saori is a year younger. The current DJ LOVE is the second. The first DJ LOVE left the band because he wanted to play different music. They started the band in 2006 in the "club EARTH" which they made themselves. In 2010,"The life of illusion"is first hit. Nowadays, they play the music all over the world.
