Bundessozialgericht

The Bundessozialgericht (German for "Federal Social Court") is the German federal supreme court of appeals for social security cases. The court was created on 11 September 1954 to hear cases about public health insurance, long-term care insurance, pension insurance and occupational accident insurance plans. These cases usually start in the "Sozialgerichte" ("Social Courts"), then the "Landessozialgerichte" ("Superior State Social Courts"), before the cases wind up at the "Bundessozialgericht".

The "Bundessozialgericht" is located in the city of Kassel.
