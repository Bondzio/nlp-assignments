Festival Song

"Festival Song" is the fourth and last single single off American pop punk band Good Charlotte's self-titled second studio album. The song was released in 2001. 

Joel Madden of Good Charlotte said that the song was about the HFStival, which is a rock festival. He explained:
"I grew up coming to the HFStival. . . I wrote this song about being here, how we wanted to quit our jobs to be in a band. We have all our friends, the fans and the radio support right here."
