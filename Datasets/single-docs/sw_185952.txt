Canning Town station

Canning Town station is a major inter-modal transport interchange in East London. It is served by London Underground's Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), as well as being served by local buses operated on behalf of London Buses. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.

The North London Line platforms will be redeveloped as part of the extension of the DLR from Canning Town to Stratford International via West Ham, which would see a more frequent service to Stratford, although passengers to NLL destinations beyond will have to change.

On the DLR City Airport extension there is a station planned south-east of here called Thames Wharf, depending mainly on the regeneration of the area.
