International Air Transport Association airport code

An IATA airport code, is a three-letter code that can be used to identify airports. This removes the need to write the name of the airport in full every time it is needed, instead an IATA code can be used.

An important use of these codes is on baggage tags. They will display the IATA code for the airport which the bags should be heading to, should they get lost.
