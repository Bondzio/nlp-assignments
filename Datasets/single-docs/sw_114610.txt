Another Code: Two Memories

Another Code: Two Memories (called Trace Memory in North America) is an adventure video game made by CING and published by Nintendo on the Nintendo DS handheld.

"Another Code" is about a 13-year-old girl called Ashley Mizuki Robbins who goes to an island called "Blood Edward Island", an island near Washington after her dad sent her a package with a machine in it two days before her 14th birthday. She goes with her aunt Jessica, who raised her when her parents disappeared. When her dad is not there, Jessica goes looking for him, and Ashley eventually has to find them both. She meets a ghost named "D", and joins with him to search a mansion on the island.
