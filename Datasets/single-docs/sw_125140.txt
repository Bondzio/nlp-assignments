Carmen: A Hip Hopera

Carmen: A Hip Hopera is an 2001 musical movie produced for television by MTV and directed by Robert Townsend. The movie stars Beyonc√© Knowles, Mos Def, Rah Digga, Wyclef Jean, Mekhi Phifer, Da Brat, Joy Bryant, Jermaine Dupri and Lil' Bow Wow. It is based upon Georges Bizet's opera, "Carmen", set in Philadelphia and Los Angeles in modern times, and features a mostly original hip-hop/R&B score in place of Bizet's opera.

The movie received mainly negative reviews. To date, it is the second major attempt at an African-American adaptation of the opera, the first being the 1943 Broadway musical "Carmen Jones" and its 1954 Academy Award nominated and box office hit movie adaptation.
