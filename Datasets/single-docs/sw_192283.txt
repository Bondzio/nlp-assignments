Mini

The Mini is a small car made by the British Motor Corporation (BMC), British Leyland and Rover from 1959 to 2000. It used a transverse engine and front-wheel drive, where the turning power was put on the front wheels of the car rather than the back wheels. Its design saved a large amount of space. It allowed most of the car's size to be used for passengers and luggage. It had only two doors, but could seat up to four passengers.

The design was very influential for car-making in the second half of the 20th century. In 1999, the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. The original model is considered an icon of the 1960s in Britain.

The original Mini was designed for BMC by Alec Issigonis.

It was first released in August 1959. Rover ceased production in October 2000. It was marketed under the names Austin, Morris, Cooper, Wolseley, Riley, British Leyland and Rover.
