Division of Wilmot

The Division of Wilmot was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Tasmania. It was located in central Tasmania. At various times it included the towns of Deloraine, Beaconsfield, Devonport, Latrobe and New Norfolk.

The Division was named after Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, the sixth Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania. It was set up for the 1903 election. The division was abolished in 1984, and new boundaries were created. Much of the area is now included in the Division of Lyons.

The most famous member was Joseph Lyons, a Premier of Tasmania, who later became the 10th Prime Minister of Australia. Lyons died while still in office, and a by-election was held for the Division in 1939.
