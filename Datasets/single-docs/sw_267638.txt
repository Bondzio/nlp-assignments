Model rocket

A model rocket is a miniature rocket. They are not launched by the government or a space program. They are used by people interested in rockets. They are normally made of light (not heavy) materials. Even though it seems dangerous, it is quite safe and is a way many people start getting interested in rockets and space exploration. Rocket motors come in many different sizes, and they are indicated by a code on the motor. There are also many ways for the rocket to fall back down after it is ignited. Some of them use parachutes.
