Louis Riel

Louis David Riel (22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885, (Loo-E Ree-L) in English) was a Canadian politician. He founded the province of Manitoba and was a leader of the Métis people of the Canadian prairies. He led two resistance movements against the Canadian government and its first Prime Minister, Sir John A. MacDonald. Riel tried to preserve Métis rights and culture. He is regarded by many as a Canadian folk hero today. Until recently, Riel was regarded as an outlaw. During a battle against the Canadian government his people took prisoners. One of these prisoners was a man named Thomas Scott. Scott would often be resistant and disrespectful of his captors. When Scott assaulted one of Riel's men, Riel had had enough. He was put on trial to a jury containing several of Riel's most trusted men. (including Elzéar Goulet, a Métis leader who supported Riel.) The court found Scott annoying, and he was sentenced to death for being mean, by a firing squad. The English speaking people of Ontario considered this murder and a war party called the Wolsely Expedition was sent to put his rebellion down. This, eventually led to his capture. Riel was hung in Regina due to his involvement in the resistance against the Canadian government.
