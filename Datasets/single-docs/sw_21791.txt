Kelp

Kelp is a type of marine seaweed. It is a brown algae. There are many different kinds of kelp. Kelp grow in large forests, usually near the surface of the water. Some kelps grow very fast (up to 30Â cm a day). Kelp can reach a length of up to 60 m. The blades are kept afloat by gas-filled bladders.

Kelp plays an important role as food and habitat for fish and other forms. It may be eaten as a vegetable.
