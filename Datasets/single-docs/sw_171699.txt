Newspeak

Newspeak is a concept from the book "1984" by George Orwell. It is based on English, which is referred to as Oldspeak in the novel, and it is the language that was created by Oceania and is the only language whose vocabulary grows smaller each year. For example, the word for "bad" becomes "ungood" in Newspeak, becoming a word simply meaning the opposite of "good", with the prefix "un-" meaning "not". In the novel, this language was designed by Party members as a means to limit human thought to absolute lowest level, that way they would be made to never be able to question whatever the Party tells the society.
