Persecution

Persecution is the mistreatment (bad treatment) of an individual or group by another group. People can be persecuted for any reasons; it is usually because of their religion, ethnicity, politics, sexuality, gender or gender identity.

Religious persecution originally meant chasing after people of a religion in order to kill them all. Nowadays it often just means discrimination.
