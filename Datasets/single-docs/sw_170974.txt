Norbert Wiener

Norbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American theoretical and applied mathematician.

Wiener founded cybernetics, the science of control and communication in animals and machines. It is a field that uses the notion of feedback, and is important for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. The name of the science comes from his book, "Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine" (1948).

"Information is information, not matter or energy". – Norbert Wiener, "Cybernetics" (1948, 155)
