Lothal

Lothal was one of the many cities found in the Indus Valley civilization. Archaeological evidence from Lothal tells us that it was an industrial area. Metals, semi-precious stones, statues and beads were found. Several weapons, ornaments, seals and workshops were also found. A dockyard was also found which may have been used to ship goods to other civilizations like Mesopotamia.
