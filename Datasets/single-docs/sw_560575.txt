Vossloh DE 18

The Vossloh DE 18 is a Bo-Bo diesel-electric locomotive. It is the first new diesel-electric locomotive to be built in Kiel since production of the DE 1002 ended in 1993. Up to 60% of the components are shared with the diesel-hydraulic G 18.

The prototype locomotive was shown together with the smaller, diesel-hydraulic G 12 on InnoTrans 2010. The launch customer for the DE 18 was BASF, ordering 2 DE 18 locomotives for services at its plants in December 2011.
