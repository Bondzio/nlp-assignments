Sedevacantism

Sedevacantism is the position, held by a small group of Traditionalist Catholics, that the person in the papal see right now is not truly pope and that, for lack of a good pope, the see has been empty since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958. A tiny number of these claim the vacancy actually goes back to the death of Pope Pius X in 1914.
