Hawk Nelson Is My Friend

Hawk Nelson is my Friend is an album by Christian rock band Hawk Nelson. It was released on April 1, 2008.

The title was taken because they find it funny - some people still think of Hawk Nelson as a person instead of a band. It was also chosen because, Hawk Nelson like to connect with fans, and make friends with them.


It also includes a special edition CD/DVD with extra tracks and a paper board game. Also including a video showing how the music video for "Friend Like That" was made. It has four other videos from the band.

"Friend Like That" was the only single from this album. It was first made available on music programmes such as Itunes. It was announced a while before, and was available on Christmas Eve 2007. However, it was taken early on websites such as YouTube.
