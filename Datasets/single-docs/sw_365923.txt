Paean (god)

In Greek mythology, Paean (PaeÃ«on or Paeon) was the Greek doctor of the gods. 

In the "Iliad", book 5, the Olympian god of war Ares is wounded by mortal hero Diomedes. Ares is to Olympus in a hurry, where Paeon applies medicine that gave an instant relief. Hades too was helped by Paeon when he was shot with an arrow by Heracles. 

Hesiod says Paeon is an individual god and not a group of people.

In time, Paeon (more usually spelled Paean) became a name used for Apollo. This is because Apollo was able to bring disease. Later, Paeon became a name used for Asclepius, the healer-god.
