Mario Party 8

Mario Party 8 is a party board video game for the Nintendo Wii. It is the eighth game in the "Mario Party" series of video games. It is the first "Mario Party" game for the Wii. It was released in North America on May 29, 2007, in Europe on June 22, 2007, and in Japan on July 26, 2007.

"Mario Party 8" plays the same as previous games in the "Mario Party" series. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through 10. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Gameplay is done with the use of the Wii Remote.

Six boards are in the game. While some boards have players get stars the same way as in previous "Mario Party" games, others have different ways. For example, in "Koopa's Tycoon Town," players get stars by putting coins into hotels (like "Monopoly"). The hotels give stars to the player with the most amount of coins in it. Fourteen characters are available for players to play as. Two characters, Blooper and Hammer Bro., make their first playable appearance in this game.
