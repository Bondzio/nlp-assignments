3D printing

3D printing is when 3D solid objects are made from a model on a computer. 3D printing is done by building up the object layer by layer.

3D printing is usually done with a materials printer. Since 2003, many more materials printers have been sold than before. Also, the cost of 3D printers has gone down.
