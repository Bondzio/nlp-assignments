Day of Ashura

The Day of Ashura is on the 10th day of Muharram in the Islamic calendar. It is the high point of the Remembrance of Muharram.

Shi'a Muslims mourn for the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. He died at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram in the year 61 AH (October 10, 680 AD). According to Sunni Muslim tradition, Muhammad fasted on this day and asked other people to fast.

In some Shi'a regions of Muslim countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Bahrain, the Commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali has become a national holiday. Most ethnic and religious communities participate in it. Even in a mostly Hindu country like India, Ashura is a public holiday.
