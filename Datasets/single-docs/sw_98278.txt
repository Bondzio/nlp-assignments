Velvet Revolver

Velvet Revolver (VR), was a Grammy Award-winning rock supergroup that started in 2002. The members of the band are Slash (guitarist), Duff McKagan (bassist, backing vocals), Matt Sorum (drums) of Guns N' Roses, and Dave Kushner (guitarist) of Wasted Youth. Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots was previously the lead singer. He joined the band after Stone Temple Pilots broke up in 2003. The band got success with their first album "Contraband" and released their second album "Libertad" in 2007. Scott Weiland left the band in 2008, though he did one more one-off show with the band in 2012. Velvet Revolver have had several searches for a new singer since then, but have yet to announce a replacement.
