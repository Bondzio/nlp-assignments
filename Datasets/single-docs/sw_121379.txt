Limit of a function

In calculus, a branch of mathematics, the limit of a function is the behavior of a certain function near a selected input value for that function. Limits are one of the main calculus topics, along with derivatives, integration, and differential equations.

The definition of the limit is as follows:

The notation for the limit above is read as "The limit of formula_1 as formula_3 approaches formula_4 is formula_2." Imagine we have a function such as formula_10. When formula_11, formula_1 is undefined, because formula_13. Therefore, on the Cartesian coordinate system, the function formula_10 would have a vertical asymptote at formula_11. In limit notation, this would be written as:

For the function formula_10, we can get as close to formula_18 in the formula_3-values as we want, so long as we "don't" make formula_3 equal to formula_18. For instance, we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001, but never 0. Therefore, we can get formula_1 as close as we want to formula_19, but without reaching it. The Left limit is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number, and the Right limit is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number. For instance, in the function formula_10, since the limit for formula_3 is 0, if formula_30, it approaches the limit from the right. If we instead choose -1, we say it approaches the limit from the left.
