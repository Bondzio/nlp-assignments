Medical abortion

A medical abortion is an abortion where drugs are used to induce the abortion. In the 1970s, such abortions became an option to end the pregnancy during its first trimester. The drugs most often used in 2009 are mifepristone and methotrexate, either alone or in combination with a prostaglandin.
