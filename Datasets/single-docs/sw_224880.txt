Stonewall Jackson

Thomas Jonathan Jackson (1824â€“1863) was an Educator and he was leading Confederate general of the American Civil War. He earned the name "Stonewall" after the First Battle of Bull Run. He was frequently called the most brilliant strategist in the Confederate Army. Jackson was considered Robert E. Lee's "right hand". Jackson was mortally wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville. On May 2, 1863, he was scouting ahead of his lines when one of his own men mistakenly shot him. His left arm was badly wounded requiring the doctors to amputate it two inches below his shoulder. He died on May 10, 1863, at the age of 39. It is probable he died of a pulmonary embolism and not from pneumonia.
