LGBT rights in Israel

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) people in Israel are considered to have more rights than anywhere else in the Middle East. In November 2005, a groundbreaking (which has not happened before) court decision in Israel ruled that a lesbian spouse could officially adopt a child born to her current partner by artificial insemination from an anonymous sperm donor; this ruling came despite protests by the minority Orthodox Jewish parliamentary parties. Common law marriage which grants most of the official marriage rights to the spouse has been achieved, but full official same-sex marriage has not yet been sanctioned. However, same-sex marriages performed elsewhere are recognized.
