Kill the DJ

"Kill the DJ" is the second single off American punk rock band Green Day's ninth studio album "Â¡Uno!". The song was released on August 14, 2012. The song is influenced from dance music which Green Day has never attempted before. 

The video features Green Day riding motorcycles through the desert going towards a nightclub in a black-and-white clip. When they perform at the club, two girls begin fighting and bottles get broken. At the end, the two girls end up with blood on their faces and clothes while they dance.
