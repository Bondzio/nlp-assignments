Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding is when a mother feeds her babies milk from her breasts. The baby puts its mouth on to their mother's nipple and sucks the milk out of the breast. Breast milk is healthier for the baby than baby formula or cow's milk. Not all women can safely feed their baby. If a woman has AIDS, tuberculosis or takes illegal drugs, the milk is not good for the baby. There are many reasons to breastfeed. Babies that breastfeed have a reduced risk for several diseases. In addition, it makes for cheaper feeding and health care. In both developing and developed countries, breastfeeding without giving the baby any other drinks leads to fewer deaths from diarrhoea. Experts agree that breast milk is the best drink for a baby, but do not all agree about how long mothers should breastfeed, and about how safe powder milk is.
