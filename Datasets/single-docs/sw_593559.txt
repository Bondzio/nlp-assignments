Love Takes Time

"Love Takes Time" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It was written by Carey and Ben Margulies, and was produced by Walter Afanasieff for Carey's debut album, "Mariah Carey" (1990). It was released as the album's second single on September 11, 1990 through CBS Records. "Love Takes Time" became Carey's second Billboard 100 number one single.

When Carey's album was first released in 1990, "Love Takes Time" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc. "(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song," Margulies laughs. "And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies."
