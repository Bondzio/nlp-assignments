Kitsune

Foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient Japan; this is why there are legends about them. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto "kami" or spirit, and serve as his messengers. A kitsune is the messenger of Death. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural importance. The more tails a kitsune has — they may have as many as nine — the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a god.
There are also appearing's of Kitsunes in Teen Wolf.
