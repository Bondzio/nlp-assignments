W Horsley Gantt

Dr. William Andrew Horsley Gantt ("Horsley") was born in Wingina, Virginia in 1892 and died in 1980 at the age of 87. He received a B.S. from the University of North Carolina and a medical degree from University of Virginia. In 1922 while doing a medical residency at University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, he took a leave of absence to join the American Relief Administration. From 1922-1923 he served as Chief at the Petrograd unit in Russia and studied the effect of famine on health. It was at this time that he met Pavlov. He ultimately returned to Petrograd in 1925 to study under Pavlov at the Institute of Experimental Medicine.

He translated many of Pavlov's works, including "Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes" and "Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes: Conditioned Reflexes and Psychiatry." He went on to study and publish "Experimental Basis for Neurotic Behavior." His research earned him the Lasker Award in 1946 and the nomination for the Nobel prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1970.

He founded the Pavlovian Laboratory at Johns Hopkins under Adolf Meyer and the Psychophysiological Research Laboratory at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Perry Point, Maryland. In 1953 he was suspended from the VA due to his alleged Communist sympathies but was cleared and reinstated. In 1955 he founded the Pavlovian Society and served as its president until 1965.

During his lifetime he had many notable friends and associates, including John Dos Passos, Ogden Nash, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and H. L. Mencken.
