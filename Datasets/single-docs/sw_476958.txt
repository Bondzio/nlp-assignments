Minor (law)

A minor is a person under age of majority, drinking age, voting age or age of consent. They are also called underage. The age of majority depends on jurisdiction, though it is usually 18 or 21. "Minor" may be also used for other reasons. For example, in most of the United States, it is against the law for anyone 20 and under to drink or have alcoholic beverages, such as beer.

In Australia, Ireland and United Kingdom, the drinking age is 18.

In Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, anyone under age 20 is a minor unless emancipated.
