Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!

Rock & Roll Jeopardy! was a music-themed television game show. It ran from August 8, 1998 to May 12, 2001 on VH1. It was hosted by Jeff Probst. It was a spin-off of the game show "Jeopardy!".

"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!" played the same as "Jeopardy!". All of the questions were music-themed. Dollar amounts were $100-$500 in the Jeopardy! round and $200-$1000 in the Double Jeopardy! round. The winner kept their winnings, with a minimum of $5,000. The other players won parting gifts. For the first two seasons, players played for points, and the winner won $5,000. Unlike "Jeopardy!", there were no returning champions.

The "Jeopardy!" main theme and think music that plays during Final Jeopardy! were remixed to fit the show's premise. The main theme of this show is currently heard on "Jeopardy!" during special tournaments.
