Knock-knock joke

A Knock-knock joke is a 5 line joke with a pun that always starts with the phrase, "Knock, Knock! Who's There?" They began with "do you know?" jokes around 1900. They became very popular in the 1930s.
The basic setup is as follows:

"Joke-Teller:" "Knock, Knock!"

"Joke-Hearer:" "Who's There?"

"Teller:" "[some phrase, typically a single word]"

"Hearer:" "[repeats Teller's phrase] who?"

"Teller:" "[punchline]"

Example:

"Joke-Teller:" "Knock-knock!"

"Joke-Hearer:" "Who's there?"

"Teller:" "Police"

"Hearer:" "Police who?"

"Teller:" "Po-lice (please) stop telling these awful knock-knock jokes!"
