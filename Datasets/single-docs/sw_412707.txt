Land Forces of the National People's Army

The Land Forces of the National People's Army () was the ground-based military branch of the National People's Army. It was the largest branch, with 120,000 soldiers.

The "LaSK" had a peacetime organisation since 1972 under the command of the "Kommando Landstreitkräfte". Its largest formations during peacetime were Military Districts III and V. 

In addition to Military Districts III and V, additional artillery and support units, as well as paratroopers of the Luftsturmregiment 40 (Prior to 1986, the 40. Fallschirmjägerbataillon), were also under direct command of the "Kdo. LaSK".

In wartime, both military districts would have been transformed into armies under Soviet high command.
