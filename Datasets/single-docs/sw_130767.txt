Boston Massacre

The Boston Massacre happened when five civilians (people who were not in the military) were shot and killed by British troops on March 5, [[1770]. It was in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], which was a [[Thirteen Colonies|British colony]] at the time. The event happened at night when a large mob got together outside of the Custom House. One British soldier named Hugh White had hit a boy who had insulted his commanding officer. The boy ran away and came back with a large mob of angry people. More British soldiers came to help protect Hugh White from the people. The mob threw snowballs with [[Clam|clams]] inside them. As the mob got larger and larger the scene became more and more chaotic. Someone in the crowd yelled "fire". In the confusion, some of the soldiers fired into the crowd. [[Crispus Attucks]], an [[African-American people|African-American]] man, was one of the first people killed.

Eight British soldiers went to [[court]] after the Boston Massacre. Only two of them, Hugh Montgomery and Matthew Killroy, were found guilty of [[manslaughter]] in court. Their punishment was to have their thumbs branded (have their thumbs marked with a [[Burn (injury)|burn]]). [[John Adams]] was the [[lawyer]] who defended the British soldiers. He knew that many people would be upset with him for defending the soldiers, but he believed that everybody deserved a fair [[trial]]. ("Adams would later become the [[President of the United States]]").four of the acts were ment four the boston tea party punishment.

[[Paul Revere]], a man who worked with [[metal|metals]] in Boston, made an [[engraving]] of the British soldiers shooting into the crowd. Many people saw the engraving and became angry. A few years later, the [[American Revolution]] started, and the colonies would become an [[Independence|independent]] country, the [[United States]] of America.
