Józef Wesołowski

Józef Wesołowski (15 July 1948 – 27 August 2015) was a Polish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was forcibly laicized by the Holy See in 2014. He was the Apostolic Nuncio to the Dominican Republic from January 2008 until he was recalled in August 2013. 

Authorities in the Dominican Republic are investigating allegations of child abuse against him. In June 2015, it was announced by the Vatican that he would stand trial for charges of possessing child pornography, and faced a possible prison term.

Wesołowski was found dead in his residence in the Vatican on 27 August 2015. A Vatican statement said that he likely died of natural causes.
