Supergiant

Supergiants are some of the largest stars in the Universe. They are larger than Giant stars, and smaller than Hypergiants.

They have a diameter about 1,000 times bigger than the Sun (the orbit of Jupiter). They are about 1.6 billion kilometers across. The star Polaris (the North Star), and the star Betelgeuse, in the constellation Orion are supergiant stars. There are two types of supergiant stars: red and blue.
