West Side Park

West Side Park is the name of a former baseball park in Chicago, Illinois. It was the home field of the Chicago Cubs baseball team from 1893 through 1915.

It was the Cubs' home ballpark when they won their only World Series championships, in 1907 and 1908. The team moved to Wrigley Field in 1916.

The park got its name from being located on the west side of Chicago. Where the ballpark once stood there is now a building in the University of Illinois Medical School.
