Pierre Boulle

Pierre Boulle (1912 - 1994) was a French writer. He was born in Avignon, France. Boulle wrote many novels and short stories in French. Two stories became popular English language movies: "Planet of the Apes" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Boulle won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay and BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay for "The Bridge over the River Kwai". He is said to have given the shortest acceptance speech in Academy Award history, the single word, ""Merci"", which means "Thank you".
