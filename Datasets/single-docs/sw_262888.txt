Bizaar

Bizaar is the sixth studio album by American Horrorcore band, Insane Clown Posse and is the second half of "Bizzar". It was released on October 31, 2000. The producers of the album were Mike E. Clark. While on the Howard Stern show, ICP talked with Sharon Osbourne who bet $50,000 they could not sell more than 200,000 copies, and that it would be subsequently dropped from its distributor. Violent J predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 units and they sold 400,000 units but Sharon never paid them. They left Island Records after "Bizaar" and "Bizzar" because their contract expired.
