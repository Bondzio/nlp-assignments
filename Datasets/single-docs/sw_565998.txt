Squash (drink)

Squash (also called "cordial" or "dilute") is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup. It is used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured. Squash is made from fruit juice, water, and sugar. Modern squashes may also contain food coloring and additional flavoring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger. The original name for Squash was "Lemon Squash" but the name was shortened to include other flavors.
