Hekatonkheires

The Hekatonkherires were Uranus' and Gaia's children. After they were born, they were thrown in a prison in Tartarus guarded by Kampê because their father thought they were hideous. Many years later Zeus, with his brothers and sisters, saved the hundred-handed Hekatonkheires and the Cyclops from Kampê's prison to fight against the Titans. The Hekatonkheires threw rocks at Mount Othrys in the Titan war and destroyed the mountain. After the Titan war, there were not many stories about the Hekatonkheires.
