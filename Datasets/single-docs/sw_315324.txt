Venona project

The Venona project was a long time small secret plan which started in February 1943 by the U.S. Army's Signal Intelligence Service. This plan had at least 13 code names for it (including NSA), however, VENONA was the last name that was used. The word VENONA is in capital letters (VENONA) although in many writings it seen as lowercase letters (Venona). VENONA was made to spy on Soviet government communications. The Venona project was most famous for the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case known as LIBERAL and it ended in both of them being executed. 

In July 1995, the first six public releases were shown which also had 49 messages about the Soviets trying to get information on the United States atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project. In the next five more years, about 3,000 VENONA messages were made public.
