Hurricane Gilbert

Hurricane Gilbert was a very powerful tropical cyclone which caused much damage to the Caribbean, Mexico and parts of South Texas in the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. Before Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert was the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in terms of Barometric pressure. 

This hurricane was similar to Hurricane Beulah and Hurricane Allen, but Hurricane Gilbert was unique in many ways. Gilbert killed 341 people and left $5.5 billion in damage.

In addition to Beulah and Allen, Hurricanes Charlie (1951), Emily during 2005 and Dean in 2007 had tracks similar to Hurricane Gilbert. Emily and Dean were Category 5 hurricanes. 

Because Gilbert left a powerful impact, the name Gilbert was retired. The name "Gordon" was used in 1994, 2000, and 2006.
