Uber

Uber is an American international company. It created the mobile app and the transportation network that are also called Uber. The mobile app allows consumers to request a trip and pay online. As of March 26, 2015, the service was available in 55 countries and more than 200 cities.

Uber was founded as "UberCab" in San Francisco by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp in 2009. Three years later, Uber started to open international offices. In 2014, it experimented with carpooling features and made other updates. Many governments and taxi companies have protested against Uber, saying that its use of unlicensed drivers was unsafe and illegal.
