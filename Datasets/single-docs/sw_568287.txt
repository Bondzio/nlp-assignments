Takobeya labour

Takobeya labour (, Romanization of Japanese: tako-beya rōdō) is Japanese working form. The harsh system started from the pioneer days in Hokkaido during the Meiji period. The workers sleeped in accommodation huts at construction sites. The concentration huts were called "Takobeya". Takobeya workers engaded in takobeya labour without enough meals. They were oppressed as labor camps. Some also died from overwork.

In 1946, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in occupied Japan banned takobeya labour.

In Japanese, "Tako" often means octopus. But Takobeya (Tako room) doesn’t necessarily mean octopus room. About Takobeya's "Tako", the original meanings is not clear.
