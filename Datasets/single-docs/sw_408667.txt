Aliyah Bet

Aliyah Bet (, "Aliyah bet") is the name of the illegal immigration to by Jews to the British Mandate of Palestine between 1934 and 1948. It is also known as Ha'apala (, meaning ascension) in Hebrew. Over 100,000 people tried to illegally enter Palestine. There were 142 voyages by 120 ships. Over half were stopped by the British patrols. Over 1,600 drowned at sea. Only a few thousand actually entered Palestine.

Other burials are in Carmel Beach cemetery in Haifa. A museum of the history of "Aliyah Bet" is in Atlit detainee camp. The central memorial for those who did the "Aliyah Bet" is in the London Garden in Tel Aviv.
