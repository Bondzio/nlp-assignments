Akina Nakamori

Within two years of her debut, she set herself apart from all the singers of her generation by singing provocative songs with the release of each new single. 

Her hair style and dress sense was very much copied by teenagers in the 1980s. Music wise, her recording company moulded her to be a successor after the mature and sophisticated Momoe Yamaguchi, a singer who retired at age 21 for marriage. Her songs were always of heartbreaks, or rebellion, never to stray far from the 'mold'.
