Promoucaes

Promoucaes, Promaucaes, Promaucas or Purumaucas (: wild people); were a pre-Columbian Mapuche tribe that lived in Chile, from the south of the River of Maipo in Santiago, Chile and the River of Itata, (tribes at the north were called "Quillotanes" and "Mapochoes" by the Spanish). They were speakers of Mapudungun like the Moluche and Picunche tribes.
