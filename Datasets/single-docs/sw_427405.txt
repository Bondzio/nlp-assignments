Palais Royal

The Palais Royal is a building in Paris. It was once a palace of the French royal family. It was built in the 1630s by Cardinal Richelieu to hold his art collection. When Richelieu died in 1642, it became the property of the young King Louis XIV. It was successivly the property of the Dukes of Orlêans and later Marie Antoinette before being destroyed in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. 

From 1649, the exiled Henrietta Maria of France and her daughter Princess Henrietta lived here. The two had escaped England during the English Civil War. They were sheltered here by King Louis XIV, who was Henrietta Maria's nephew.

In 1692, when the Duke of Chartres (future Regent of France) married Françoise Marie de Bourbon, the King gave the Palais Royal to his brother, Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans, ""Monsieur"".

Louis Philippe I, future King of the French, was born here. He was the son of the young Philippe Égalité and his wife Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon.

Louise Henriette de Bourbon also died here. She was married to Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans. The future Louis Philippe I was also born here.
