Coconut milk

Coconut milk is a sweet, milky white cooking base which comes from the meat of a mature coconut. The color and rich taste of the milk can be attributed to the high oil content and sugars. It should not be confused with coconut water (coconut juice), which is the natural liquid found inside a coconut. It is used in many tropical recipes. There are two kinds of coconut milk: thick and thin.
