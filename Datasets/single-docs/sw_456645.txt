M. Emmet Walsh

Michael Emmet Walsh (born March 22, 1935) is an American movie, television, stage, and voice actor. He has appeared in over 200 movies and television series. He is known for his roles in "The Jerk", "Blood Sample", "Killer Image", and in "Wild Wild West".

According to Roger Ebert's Stanton-Walsh Rule, "no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad." Ebert later conceded that this rule was broken by 1999's "Wild Wild West" (Walsh) and "Dream a Little Dream" (Stanton).
