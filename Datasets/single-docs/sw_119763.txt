Big Brother 9 (UK)

Big Brother UK 2008 was the 9th series of "Big Brother", a television programme. New rules were put in place since the last series and this one was called "Zero Tolerance" (meaning that no bad behaviour was accepted). Sixteen housemates entered the house on the first day, and five more housemates entered the house as the days went by. After ninety-three days inside the Big Brother House, Rachel Rice was voted the winner of the show, and took home Â£100,000.
