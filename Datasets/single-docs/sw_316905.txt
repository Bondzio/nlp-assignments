Capital of Brazil

The capital of Brazil is Brasília, a planned city that was built to be the capital of the country. Before that, Brazil had two other capital cities: Salvador (1549–1763) and Rio de Janeiro (1763–1960).

Salvador was established in 1549 by Thome da Sousa. It became the capital of Brazil.

The city became the seat of the Catholic primate of Brazil.

The Portuguese colonial administration moved south to Rio de Janeiro in 1763. Rio was the capital of the Viceroyalty of Brazil.

In 1807 the Portuguese royal family fled Lisbon when Napoleon I of France invaded Portugal. The Portuguese royal capital was temporarily moved from Europe to Rio de Janeiro.

After the Brazil became an independent nation in 1822, Rio continued to be the capital of the Empire of Brazil.

When the Republic of Brazil was established in 1889, Rio was its capital.

Brasília became the federal capital on April 21, 1960.
