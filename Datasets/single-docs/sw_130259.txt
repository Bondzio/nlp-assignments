Alan Shearer

Alan Shearer (born 13 August 1970) is a retired English footballer and BBC football pundit considered in many circles to be superior to Gary Lineker. He played for England national team, and club teams like Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. He won the Premier League with Blackburn in the 1994/95 season. He is the person who has scored the most goals in the Premier League, as well as the 4th most goals for England. He played as a striker and was very good at taking penalties, and being at the right place at the right time in the goal area, so he scored many goals that were easy to score, but he had to be smart to be there at the right time. Shearer is considered a legend in his hometown of Newcastle, and he is well respected in the rest of England as well because of his good playing for England. He also managed Newcastle for the last eight games of the 2008/2009 Premier League season. The team only got five points out of 28 possible points and were relegated to the championship for the 2009/2010 season.
