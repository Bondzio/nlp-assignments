Tornado Alley

Tornado Alley is a colloquial term most often used to refer to the area of the United States in which tornadoes are most frequent. The 1974 super tornado outbreak with 148 tornados, took place in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

Schools in Tornado Alley often have tornado drills, and many homes may have tornado shelters where people can go for safety.
