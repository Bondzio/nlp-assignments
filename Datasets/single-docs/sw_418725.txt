Arrondissement of Muret

The arrondissement of Muret is an arrondissement of France. It is part of the Haute-Garonne "département" in the Occitanie region. Its capital is the city of Muret.

When the Haute-Garonne department was created in 1790, Muret was one of the districts of the department and, with the creation of "arrondissements" in 1800, the "arrondissement" of Muret was part of that original department, but it was eliminated in 1803 and, in 1806, became again an "arrondissement".

In 1926, the "arrondissement" of Muret was eliminated again but, in 1942, it was made again an "arrondissement".

It is the smallest of the "arrondissements" of the department, with an area of , but it is the second in population with 215,606 inhabitants and a density of inhabitants/km²

The "arrondissement" is bordered to the northeast by the "arrondissement" of Toulouse, to the south by the Ariège (Occitanie) department, to the southwest by the "arrondissement" of Saint-Gaudens and to the northwest by the Gers (Occitanie) department.
