Pope Innocent VI

Pope Innocent VI (; c. 1282 – September 12, 1362), born Étienne Aubert, was an French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 200th Pope from December 18, 1352 until his death in 1362.

He was the fifth of the seven popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Étienne Aubert was born in the hamlet of Les Monts, which is today part of the commune of Beyssac in the Corrèze department of France. He was the son of Adhemar Aubert (1260-?), seigneur de Montel-De-Gelas in Limousin. 

Aubert was made the Bishop of Noyon in 1338; and he became the Bishop of Clermont in 1340.

In 1342, he was raised to the position of cardinal.

Cardinal Aubert was elected pope on December 18, 1352. He chose to be called Innocent VI. 
Pope Innocent was involved in Italian and European political disputes.


The tomb of Innocent VI is at the Carthusian monastery of Villeneuve-les-Avignon.
