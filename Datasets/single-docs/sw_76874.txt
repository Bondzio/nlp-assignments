Antoni Lange

Antoni Lange (1861 or 1863 – March 17, 1929), was a Polish poet, translator and mystic philosopher of the Symbolism and Parnassianism movements. He was regarded as a "great master of reflective poetry". He spoke 15 languages. His pen-names were Antoni Wrzesień and Napierski. Although Lange was not a particularly famed author, many people call him "a magican of lyrical form" because of his unquestionable mastery in using rare poetic forms and innovation,s which makes him a pioneer of modern "collage" and even imagism movement.

As a religious thinker Lange was one of the first to make people interested in Indian philosophy and literature in Poland. His existential reflection of "universal pain" ("wszechcierpienie") unites Christian mysticism with traditions of Buddhism.

Lange was also an uncle of the poet Bolesław Leśmian.

He was born in 1861 or 1863 into a patriotic Jewish family who were heavily influenced by the messianic ideals of Romantic Polish poets, especially Adam Mickiewicz. In 1830, his father Henri Lange took part in the November Uprising.

"Lange's own poems did not win him recognition, and the last phase of his life was poisoned by feelings of bitterness". He never married and had no children.

<poem>Eternal solitaries - human souls,
Solitaries blown astray;
Each wanders through the Milky Way,
Each in her finite circle rolls.

Like wandering planets they gaze
At one another in the sky's blue halls;
Each in her finite circle rolls,
But never from her orbit sways.</poem>
