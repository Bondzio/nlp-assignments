Hymenium

The hymenium is the layer of tissue on the hymenophore of the part of a fungus that fruits. It is where cells grow into basidium or asci, which make spores.

Where the hymenium is found is traditionally the first thing used to identify mushrooms or to group mushrooms into families. Below are some examples of where to find the hymenium in different types of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.
