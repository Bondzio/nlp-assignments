Diamondback rattlesnake

The diamondback rattlesnake is a very poisonous rattlesnake. Diamondbacks are found from Florida to California. The bite from a big rattlesnake can hold enough poison to kill a person. However, if the victim gets to a doctor quickly enough, he or she can usually survive. If you spend time in regions where diamondback rattlesnakes live, you should take a few precautions. People must be especially careful around caves. Rattlesnakes sometimes hibernate in caves during cool weather. If you listen carefully for its unusual rattling noise, you can know where it is hiding.
