Peace be upon him (Islam)

Peace be upon him (PBUH) or ʿalayhi as-salām (SAAS) is a phrase religious muslims say whenever they refer to the name of the prophet Muhammad. Peace be upon him is the English language translation of "alayhi as-salām". In any language it is a sign of great respect and honor. It is also used whenever saying the name of others seen as great prophets (Jesus, Moses, etc.). Muslims say or write the phrase to get Allah's blessings for Muhammad, and in turn, get blessings for themselves. The abbreviations PBUH and SAAS are used in writing in the Muslim world in private and sometimes government documents. The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, commands this respect be given. The Qur'an 33:56 says "God and his angels send blessings on the Prophet. O you who believe! Send blessings on him, and salute him with all respect." PBUH is a reminder for Muslims to follow his teachings and to be like Muhammad in everything they say and do.
