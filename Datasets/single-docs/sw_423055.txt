Division of Cook

The Division of Cook is an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. It was set up in 1969 and is named for James Cook, who mapped the east coast of Australia in 1770. It is located in the southern suburbs of Sydney, including Caringbah, Cronulla, Miranda and Sylvania. 

In 2007 there were claims that the Liberal candidate Michael Towke had broken party rules and not told the truth about himself. These claims were later found to be not true. Towke lost his Liberal party position and was replaced with Scott Morrison, former director of the New South Wales Liberal Party. In 2013 Morrison became the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.
