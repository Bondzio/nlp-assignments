War of the Spanish Succession

The War of the Spanish Succession was a war which was fought from 1701 to 1714. It was fought over who had the right to be king of Spain after the previous king, Charles II, died childless. France wanted Philip of Anjou, a relative of its king, to rule. Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and other states wanted to prevent that. 

The war was mostly fought in Europe but battles also happened in the West Indies, South America, and North America. In North America, it was called Queen Anne's War, since the ruler of Great Britain was Queen Anne. The war ended in Philip of Anjou ultimately winning and becoming the next king of Spain known as Philip V. Britain and its allies accepted Philip as King of Spain, who gave up his right to be king also of France. Austria got most of Spanish Italy. Britain got Spanish Majorca and Gibraltar.
