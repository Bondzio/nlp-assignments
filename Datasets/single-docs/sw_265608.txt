Tropical Storm Allison (1989)

Tropical Storm Allison is a storm that struck Texas and west central Louisiana during June 1989. It was responsible for $500 million in damage and eleven deaths. The storm formed via a westward moving tropical wave merged with the remnants of Pacific Hurricane Cosme. Despite the damage, the name "Allison" was not retired. However, in June 2001, another Tropical Storm Allison caused major devastation in the same areas, causing the name "Allison" to be retired.
