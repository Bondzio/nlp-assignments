Emperor Kenzō

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

Kenzō was a grandson of Emperor Richū; and he was adopted as heir by the childless Emperor Seinei.

Very little is known about the events of Kenzō's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kenzō. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, Kenzō final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
