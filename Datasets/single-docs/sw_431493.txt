Shrimp toast

Shrimp toast or prawn toast is a Chinese dim sum dish. It is small triangles of bread, brushed with egg and topped with chopped shrimp and water chestnuts. It is baked or deep fried. It is often served as an appetizer in Chinese restaurants in Australia and the United States. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, sesame seeds are sometimes sprinkled on the dish before it is baked or deep fried.
