Norwegian Crusade

The Norwegian Crusade was one of several religious wars in which European countries fought against Muslims in Turkey and the Middle East. The First Crusade was 1095-1099. The Norwegian Crusade was next, from 1107 to 1110. King Sigurd I led the crusade. Sigurd was the first European king to go on crusade to the Holy Land. He did not lose any battles. The Norwegian crusade seems to have been similar to earlier Viking raids.
