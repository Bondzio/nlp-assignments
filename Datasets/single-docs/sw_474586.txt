Duke of Aumont

The title of Duke of Aumont was established in 1665. It was first given to Antoine d'Aumont de Rochebaron (1601–1669). For a long time, the dukes of Aumont had the title of first Gentleman of the Chamber of the King ("gentilhomme de la chambre du Roi"). They were a fairly influential and wealthy family. They owned the "Hôtel d'Aumont" a large townhouse in Paris. The family also had many other titles including "Marquis of Villequier". This was sometimes used by the heir to the ducal title.

The present reigning Prince of Monaco is a direct descendant of the family.
