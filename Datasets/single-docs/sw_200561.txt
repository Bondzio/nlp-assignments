Papyrus 46

Papyrus 46 (also referred to as simply formula_1) is one of the oldest New Testament manuscripts known to exist. It was probably created between the year 175 and 225. Some leaves are part of the Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri Collection, and others are in the Papyri Collection of the University of Michigan. According to the website Bible Research, it contains (in order) "the last eight chapters of Romans; all of Hebrews; virtually all of 1st Corinthians and 2nd Corinthians; all of Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians; and two chapters of Thessalonians. All of the leaves have lost some lines at the bottom through deterioration."
