Saturn Outlook

The Saturn Outlook is a full-size crossover SUV that was built by General Motors' Saturn brand. The Outlook was made by the Saturn Corporation from 2006 to 2010 until Saturn went defunct in 2010. The Saturn Outlook replaced the Relay minivan which was discontinued due to its unsuccessful sales. The vehicle received a 5 out of 5 stars for both frontal and side by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and was also named Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Top Safety Pick in both 2008 and 2009. Although the Saturn brand is no longer active GM has decided to use the bodyshell of the Outlook on the redesigned GMC Acadia.
