Bicentenaria

Bicentenaria is a genus of carnivorous coelurosaurian theropods which lived during the early Upper Cretaceous (about 90 million years ago) in what is now Argentina. It contains only the type species, "Bicentenaria argentina". Estimates suggest that it was in length. This name was first reported in June 2012.

The small carnivore is an early relative of the much later giant "Tyrannosaurus".
