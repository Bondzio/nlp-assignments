Reynaldo Hahn

Reynaldo Hahn (August 9, 1874 â€“ January 28, 1947) was a French composer, conductor, music critic and diarist (he wrote a diary). He was famous for his songs. He wrote the music (which was considered "insipid") for the ballet "Le Dieu bleu". The ballet was a failure and the music was blamed.
