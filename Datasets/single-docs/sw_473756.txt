Samsung Galaxy S5

Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy S5 or just GS5 is an Android smartphone made by Samsung Electronics. The phone was released on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries as the replacement to the Galaxy S4. Like the S4, the S5 is similar to the prior year's model, placing a large focus on a better build with a textured rear cover and IP67 rating for dust and water proof, a better user feel, new security items such as a fingerprint scanner and private mode, expanded health items (such as a built-in heart rate scanner), and an updated camera.
