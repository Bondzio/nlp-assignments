Malcolm I of Scotland

Malcolm I, born 896-900 was king of Scotland from 943-954 and was the successor to his 1st cousin once removed king Constantine II and was the monarch who celebrated the 100th anniversary of Scottish monarchs (843-943). 

Donald was born between 896 and 900 somewhere in Scotland, although the place and exact time of his birth is unclear like many of the monarchs before him.

His reign began in 943, 100 years after Kenneth I, the first king of Scotland and lasted 11 years until 954. During his reign he would marry Bethoc who gave him 2 children, Dub (later to be king) and Kenneth III (also to be king). He also may of had a child named Mogallus mac Malcolm, prince of Scots in 934, before becoming king.

Malcolm died in 954, passing the throne to Indulf and later his two sons Kenneth and Dub. After his death many monarchs would take his name as king of Alba "Rex Alban" making him "according to some sources" the first king of Alba, instead of Constantine II.
