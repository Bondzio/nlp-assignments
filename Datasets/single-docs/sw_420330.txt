Saints Row (series)

Saints Row is a series of video games created by Volition game studios. It features mechanics similar to the "Grand Theft Auto" series. While the first two installments of the game had a serious and dark tone; starting from "Saints Row 2", Volition decided to experiment with dark humor and unrealistical gameplay, ranging from impossible air stunts to the use of septic tanks as a weapon. In "Saints Row the Third", Volition decided to abandon completely the realistical use of physics as well as almost any attempt of portraying a realistic world.

"Saints Row IV" was released in 2013 and modified the gameplay allowing the player to fly and use super powers, rendering the use of cars, planes, and boats, impractical.

"Saints Row Gat out of Hell" was released in 2015 and allows you to play in Hell with the use of super powers again.
