Skin Diamond

Skin Diamond (born Raylin Christensen; February 18, 1987) is the stage name of an award winning American pornographic actress and nude model.

Diamond was born in Ventura, California, and raised in Dunfermline, Scotland, where her parents moved as missionaries. She is of Ethiopian, Danish, Czech, Yugoslav, and German descent. Her father is American actor Rodd Christensen. She appeared in the TV series "Balamory" as a child, alongside her only sister, Heather.

Diamond started her career as a mainstream model and posed, among others, for Louis Vuitton, American Apparel and Atsuko Kudo. She made her pornographic debut in a 2009 Burning Angel film. In that film, she was originally only supposed to perform a girl/girl scene, but, in the end, she shot two boy/girl scenes.

In 2012, Diamond posed for comic book artist David Mack, who portrayed her as Echo in the Marvel Comics miniseries "". In 2013 she posed for photographer Terry Richardson.

In 2014, Diamond was on CNBC's list of "The Dirty Dozen: Porn's Most Popular Stars". Diamond was also cast (with Jenna Haze) in an acting role in the music video for hip-hop artist B.o.B for his song "John Doe" which features Priscilla Renea. The single is from B.o.B's third album, "Underground Luxury". She also appeared in the music video for Cheerleader by Omni in 2012.

Diamond has several tattoos, including a Phoenix on her back, which she got to cover an accidental burn. She also has piercings in her navel, right nostril, and both nipples. She is also well known for her distinctive shaved-on-one-side haircut; because of this, she has been featured in the column "Beauty Showdown" in the magazine "Cosmopolitan".
