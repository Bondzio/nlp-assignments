Flight of the Bumble Bee

"Flight of the Bumble Bee" is a musical composition by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for solo violin and orchestra. It was written as an interlude for his opera, "The Tale of Tsar Saltan" (1899-1900). The music depicts the buzzing of a bumble bee in its flight. It is a popular piece, especially with children, and is often played outside the opera as a concert piece.
