Martin Gardner

Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914â€“May 22, 2010) was an American writer. He had many interests, so he wrote about many topics. He wrote about mathematics, magic, literature, philosophy, skepticism, and religion. He wrote the "Mathematical Games" column in the "Scientific American" magazine from 1956 to 1981. After that, he wrote the "Notes of a Fringe Watcher" column in the "Skeptical Inquirer" magazine. He published over 70 books.

Gardner also sometimes wrote under pen names. As "Uriah Fuller" he wrote "Confessions of a Psychic". As "George Groth", he criticized his book, "The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener". 




Note: Gardner also wrote some books on magic for professional magicians. These books are not listed here.

Martin Gardner's columns from "Scientific American" are printed in 15 books. Don Knuth calls these books "the Canon".
