Répertoire national des certifications professionnelles

In France, the Répertoire national des certifications professionnelles (RNCP) has been created by article L. 335-6 of the "Code de l'éducation" (Education Code).

The "répertoire national des certifications professionnelles" has for purpose to make available to individuals and businesses constantly update information on educational degrees and certificates on the lists established by the "commissions paritaires nationales de l'emploi des branches professionnelles" (national commissions). It helps to facilitate access to employment, human resources management and mobility.

Certifications stored in the directory are recognized throughout the country.

Under the authority of the Minister for Vocational Training, the "Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle" establishes and updates the "répertoire national des certifications professionnelles". It ensures the renewal and adaptation of diplomas.

Degrees are classified in the "répertoire national des certifications professionnelles" by field of activity and level. For this criterion, until the adoption of the new classification referred to in article 8 of decree of 26 April 2002 referred to above, diplomas are classified according to the "nomenclature des niveaux de formation" (levels of training) approved by decision of the permanent group of vocational training and social advancement.
