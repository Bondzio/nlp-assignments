Dumb Starbucks

Dumb Starbucks was a coffee shop opened by comedian Nathan Fielder. It was closed just after three days for not having a proper health license. Because the shop was a parody making fun of the real Starbucks company, Fielder was able to use their logo.

In a normal Starbucks store, you will usually see a board with the beverages that you can purchase. But in Dumb Starbucks, it had the word "Dumb" in front of the name of the beverage you would see at Starbucks. For example, if you saw the Vanilla Latte at Starbucks, in Dumb Starbucks, it would be called "Dumb Vanilla Latte". Usually Starbucks has some other items, such as music CDs, but Dumb Starbucks also took the same music CD's and wrote the word "Dumb" in front of them.

Nathan Fielder had planned to open another Dumb Starbucks in Brooklyn, New York, but he didn't try to open one, even with health documents. Many people have did not like Fielder and his new parody. Some people felt he was making fun of them being Starbucks customers, others said his coffee was just terrible.
