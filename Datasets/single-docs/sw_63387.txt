Professional wrestling

Professional wrestling, pro wrestling or simply wrestling is a kind of sport. It is different from other sports because it is a fixed sport. It is also known as sports entertainment.

Most wrestlers are exceptional athletes who train for many hours each day to maintain their physical condition. They practice for years to learn both the moves and how to execute them safely while still making it look dangerous. They suffer many injuries, sometimes severe. Their schedules are grueling. There is certainly nothing fake about flying 20 feet through the air from the top rope. 

Professional wrestling is done as a show, like a play. Many wrestlers will wrestle in many fights, called matches. They wrestle inside a 'wrestling ring', which is a place with ropes around it. The best wrestlers can win belts, called 'championship titles', to show that they are the best.

The most famous pro wrestler is Dwayne Johnson, performing in the ring as 'The Rock'. In his relatively short career, The Rock quickly became an icon of the industry and his wrestling success has translated into a very successful movie career. Some other well known pro wrestlers are Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Andr√© the Giant, Sting, "Macho Man" Randy Savage, Bret "The Hitman" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Mick Foley, Stone Cold Steve Austin and John Cena.

Many people like to watch professional wrestling on television or live in person while it happens. The United States, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are countries that have a lot of professional wrestling.

The biggest company of professional wrestling is WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment). Once a year, they have a big wrestling event called WrestleMania.
