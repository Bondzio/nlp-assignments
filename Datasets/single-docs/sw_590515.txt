Knut Hamsun

Knut Hamsun (1859-1952) was a Norwegian author and winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, in 1920.

An obituary he wrote for Adolf Hitler was published on 7 May 1945 in Aftenposten (a newspaper).

He married Marie Hamsun. Their children include Tore Hamsun.

In 1978, Gabriel Langfeldt released a book that listed the entire [written] statement of the court-appointed [medical] experts, from Hamsun's trial; spokesman for the Hamsun family - Leif Hamsun (a grandchild of Knut Hamsun) - said that after Langfeldt revealed my grandparents [privileged interviews with court-appointed experts], there is little that is private anymore.

Hamsun voluntarily went to psychoanalysis during 1926 to 1928; the psychoanalyst made notes.

Notes from the psychoanalysis of Hamsun, were published in 2017; the photocopied notes were from [Hamsun's appointments] with his psychoanalyst; photocopied notes were part of [a work of] art that was published in Vagant [a magazine].


Nobel Prize-winning writer Isaac Bashevis Singer translated some of his works.
