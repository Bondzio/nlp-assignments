History of bus transport in Hong Kong

The history of bus transport in Hong Kong started in 1920 when the first bus route started providing service.

While there was the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese government had tried to turn bus service to the status before the war. However, it wasn't successful since there has run out of petrol.

After WWII, the bus companies temporarily used vans to carry the passages. They used back buses after about 100 buses were bought from the UK.
