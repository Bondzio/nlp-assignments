The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a is a selection of 8 musical numbers Tchaikovsky made from "The Nutcracker" ballet for a concert performance before the St. Petersburg branch of the Musical Society on March 19, 1892. Every number was acclaimed and repeated, and the suite became an instant hit. The complete ballet was first performed on December 17, 1892. It was not a success.
