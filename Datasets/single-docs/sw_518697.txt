2014-15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball

The 2014â€“15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team represented the University of Kentucky in their 39th season playing home games at Rupp Arena. The team was lead by John Calipari for the 6th consecutive season.

The 2014-2015 team won all 31 regular season games, similar to what the Witchita State team did the year before. They are the first team in NCAA basketball to begin a season with a record of 38-0. Following the regular season, the 2014-2015 team made it to the Final Four, facing the Wisconsin Badgers for the second consecutive year at the tournament in Indianapolis. 

Despite having won all regular season games, the 2014-2015 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team neither finished with a perfect record, nor came out champions, as they lost to Wisconsin in the Final Four, finishing their season 38-1.
