2016 shooting of Dallas police officers

The 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers was an incident in which five police officers were killed by a man with a gun in Dallas, Texas. Six other officers and a civilian were also injured.

Earlier in the week, two black men were killed by police: one in Louisiana, another in Minnesota. In Dallas on July 7, people protested against police brutality. The protest was not violent. But just before 9 p.m. (Central time) while the protest was ending, Micah Xavier Johnson began shooting police officers. A suspicious package was found near the area.

President Barack Obama spoke against the attacks, saying the shootings were a "vicious, calculated, despicable attack" and a "tremendous tragedy."
