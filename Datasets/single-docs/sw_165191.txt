Latin Wikipedia

The Latin Wikipedia (In Latin: Vicipaedia or "Vicipaedia Latina") is the Latin language edition of Wikipedia. Started in May 2002, this edition had over 80,000 articles as of October 2012.

As of October 2015, it is the 47th largest edition of Wikipedia by number of articles.

"Vicipaedia" is the largest Wikipedia in a dead language, (a language that is no longer anyone's mother tongue). There are several reasons why people continue to use Latin. Students learn it in schools and universities because of its influence on culture and science, especially in Europe. People still read Latin classics such as the poems of Virgil, the memoirs of Caesar and the speeches of Cicero. Also, Latin is widely used as an international auxiliary language, notably in the Catholic Church, and by biologists when describing and naming new species.
