Industrial park

An industrial park is an area made for industrial development. It is similar to a business park or an office park. An industrial park can have factories, oil refineries, and warehouses. They can also have other industrial buildings.

Industrial parks are normally built away from places where people live. They can usually be accessed in more than one way. The most common ways are by road and train.
