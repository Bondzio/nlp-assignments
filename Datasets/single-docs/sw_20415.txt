Sons and Daughters of Saint Lucia

"Sons and Daughters of Saint Lucia" is the national anthem of Saint Lucia. The song has been used since the country became independent in 1979. 

<poem>
Sons and daughters of Saint Lucia, 
love the land that gave us birth,
land of beaches, hills and valleys, 
fairest isle of all the earth. 

Wheresoever you may roam, 
love, oh, love your island home. 

Gone the times when nations battled 
for this 'Helen of the West, 
gone the days when strife and discord. 
Dimmed her children's toil and rest. 

Dawns at last a brighter day, 
stretches out a glad new way. 

May the good Lord bless our island, 
guard her sons from woe and harm! 
May our people live united, 
strong in soul and strong in arm! 

Justice, Truth and Charity, 
our ideal for ever be!
</poem>
