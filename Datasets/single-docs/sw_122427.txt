Citizendium

Citizendium (short for the citizens' compendium) is an English-language wiki-based online encyclopedia launched by Larry Sanger in 2007. On this wiki, people have to use their given names and must request an account to prove they are real. Articles created by Citizendium editors are under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. As of October 2013, Citizendium has 16,500 articles and 149 approved articles.

Experts are given a special status on Citizendium: they are allowed to "approve" articles and are able to decide who is right when there are conflicts over the content in the encyclopedia.

The server which runs the website costs money to run. The only way the wiki will stay active is if members donate money, or if Citizendium can find a group or organization that can provide funds.
