Kōkō Seamount

The seamount is also known as the "Kōkō Guyot"' because it has a flat top. This undersea geologic feature is also called a "guyot" or "tablemount".

This seabed mountain is named after Emperor Kōkō of Japan.

The last eruption from Kōkō seamount was 48 million years ago. The north side of Kōkō Seamount was formed at least 52.6 million years ago; and the south side of Kōkō is dated at 50.4 million years ago.
