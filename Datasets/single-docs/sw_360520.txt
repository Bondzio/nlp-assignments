Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)

This is a list of movies by year that they received an Oscar. Also listed are the other nominations for best documentary short subject. 



Note: A press release by AMPAS in 2005 says that "Documentary Short Subject winners "Benjy" (1951) and "Neighbours" (1952) are among a group of films that not only competed, but won Academy Awards in what were clearly inappropriate categories. "Benjy", directed by Fred Zinnemann and narrated by Henry Fonda, is the fictional tale of a crippled boy. The film was used as a fundraiser for the Los Angeles Orthopedic Hospital. ... Norman McLaren's "Neighbours", which today would compete in the Animated Short category, used "pixilation" â€“ animation using living people - to create an allegory of war."
