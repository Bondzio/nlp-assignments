Hoax

The word hoax refers to a concept or idea that is not true. For example, a person makes up false accusations about being victimized by other people, or an article may make things up that cause people to believe as though they are true when they are not.

Hoaxes come in all types of forms: for example, April Fools' Day tricks that are shown in a time related to April 1st, then shown to be a hoax later.
