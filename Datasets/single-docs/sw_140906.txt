Bleed American

Bleed American is the fourth album released by Jimmy Eat World and was made available in 2001. They had to change the title in stores to "Salt Sweat Sugar" because they were scared "Bleed American" would be taken the wrong way, possibly in an offensive way due to the September 11 attacks.


On the second song, "Praise chorus" they mention old songs such as our house in the middle of the street. Davey Von Bohlen from The promise ring does some of the vocals for the song.

"Hear you me" is believed to be written for two fans who died, it's also referring to the weezer song

"The authority song" makes certain references to the Pop culture - the dj never has it, j.a.m.c automatic, if those were roys headphones, you'd bet he play what goes on.
"Roy's headphones" is referring to Roy Miranda, a popular artist/dj in Arizona.
