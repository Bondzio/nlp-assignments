Superconductor

A superconductor is a special type of material that conducts electricity without resistance. That means that electrons (tiny particles with negative charge) can flow very easily through the material. This can be achieved only at very low temperatures. The critical temperature at which a material becomes superconducting varies from material to material. Most materials are not superconductors. 

Another property of superconductors is the Flux Trapping Effect, which can cause a rare earth magnet to float above a cooled superconductor.
