Presidential $1 Coin Program

The Presidential $1 Coin Program is part of an Act of Congress, , which directs the United States Mint to produce $1 coins with portraits of U.S. presidents.

From 2007 to 2011, presidential $1 coins were minted for circulation in large numbers, resulting in a large stockpile of unused $1 coins. Since 2012, new presidential coins have been minted only for collectors.

Dollar coins were issued bearing the likenesses of presidents, as follows:
† — The act specifies that a president must have been deceased for no fewer than two years to be honored in the series. ("See above.") President Carter and Reagan's successors are currently living and therefore do not qualify.
