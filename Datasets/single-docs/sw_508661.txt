Mitraillette

A Mitraillette (, literally "submachine gun"), is a type of food from Belgium. It might come from Brussels, but is also popular in Flanders, Wallonia and the Nord region of France, where it is also known as an ""Américain"" (literally an "American").

A typical "mitraillette" consists of:


Crudités are often included (grated carrot, fresh lettuce, tomato slices), though different in each location. Cheese and cabbage are also sometimes included.

Originally "mitraillettes" only contained a sausage or sliced meat. Different versions quickly became available. Often, dürüms are served instead in more multicultural areas.
