List

A list is a part of a text, which has many words separated by commas (,) or a group of words going down the page that may use bullet points, letters, or numbers. Semi-colons (;) are also used sometimes to separate items in a list.

These are lists:

I have invited Peter, Mary, and Henry to my birthday.

People who I have invited to my birthday are:

People I invited to my birthday: Peter; Mary; Henry.
