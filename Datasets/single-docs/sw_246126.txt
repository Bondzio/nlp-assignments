The campaign can be played in either single player or in multiplayer. It can also be set to 4 different difficulty modes: easy, normal, difficult or heroic.

"Instant action" is another playable mode. It allows the player about 16 different scenarios, plus 2 more downloadable ones. There are several different game types that can be played:

Instant action can also be played online with anybody else, whenever anybody is online. The campaign mode, however has to be played with a friend, someone that the player knows and has consciously added. This way, if the friend with the game is not online, then the campaign cannot be played.
