Gender dysphoria

Gender dysphoria is a term used by psychologists and physicians. It describes people who strongly feel they are not the gender they were born with. It used to be called "gender identity disorder." But it is not a mental illness. It is a condition accompanied by stress, anxiety, and depression. To be diagnosed with gender dysphoria now, patients must exhibit strong cross-gender feelings that persist over time. It is not just a desire to change sex for some advantage they might think exists.

Gender dysphoria may cause many to become socially isolated. Boys especially may be ostracized which can lead to low self-esteem. It often leads to avoiding or dropping out of school. Feminine speech patterns and mannerisms are common in boys with gender dysphoria. Adolescents in particular are at risk of suicide.
