Francis Eaton

Francis Eaton (11 September 1596 - autumn, 1633) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. He signed the Mayflower Compact.

Eaton was the son of John Eaton and his wife Dorothy (Smith) Eaton. He was baptized on 11 September 1596 at St. Thomas church in Bristol, England. Eaton was a house carpenter. He married Sarah about 1618 and had a son named Samuel. The family left for North America in 1620 on the "Mayflower".

Sarah died in the New World during the winter of 1620-1621. Eaton married John Carver's servant Dorothy _____ before 1623. She died shortly after the marriage, leaving no children.

In the 1623 Division of Land at Plymouth, Eaton received four shares: one for himself, one for his deceased first wife Sarah, one for his son, and one for his current wife Dorothy. They were all "Mayflower" passengers.

About 1626, Eaton married Christiana Penn. They had three children: Rachel, Benjamin, and a child whose name is unknown but was called "an ideote" (mentally disabled).

In 1631, Eaton began having money troubles. He sold some of his land, some livestock, and his house. He died some time between 25 October and 8 November 1633 at Plymouth. He died in debt. His estate included some livestock, fifty bushels of corn, some clothing, some carpenter's tools, some boards, fishing lead, and some kitchen items. He was buried in Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony.
