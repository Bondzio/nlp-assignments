Transgender Day of Remembrance

Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) is an event that happens every year on November 20 around the world. It is about remembering transgender people who were killed by people who do not like transgender people (transphobes). It was started in 1998 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, a transwoman. Smith made the event because a transwoman called Rita Hester was murdered. It happens on the last day of Transgender Awareness Week.
