Solomon Islands

The Solomon Islands are a group of islands in the South Pacific. They are known for their beauty and for the many languages spoken there. The capital of the Solomon Islands is Honiara.

In the 1890's the islands became a protectorate of the British Empire. Empire of Japan forces arrived in early 1942 and the United States Marine Corps attacked them, starting the Guadalcanal Campaign.

The country is divided into nine provinces and the town of Honiara.
