Coprime

In mathematics, two integers ("a" and "b") are co-prime (or relatively prime) if they share no common factors. In other words, there is no number, other than 1, that divides both a and b evenly. The highest common factor (HCF) of these numbers should be 1

As an example, 6 and 35 are coprime, because the factors of 6, 2 and 3, do not divide 35 evenly. 6 and 27 are not coprime, because 3 divides both 6 and 27. Another example is 4 and 5:
4 = 2*2*1; 
5 = 5*1 (Prime). The only common factor is 1, so they are co-prime.

Likewise 10 and 5:
10 = 5*2 


If the HCF of 2 numbers is 1 then they are co prime.
