The frog species was discovered in August of 2009 by Christopher Austin when exploring Papua New Guinea. The National Science Foundation sponsored the exploration.

The frog is a millimeter smaller than the previous record holder for being the world's smallest vertebrate â€“ a species of carp ("Paedocypris progenetica") from Indonesia. The frog mainly lives on land. According to its discoverers, the life cycle of the frog does not include a tadpole stage.
