Marauder's Map

The Marauder's Map is a fictional map of Hogwarts. It is a magical map. It was created by James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew under their nicknames Prongs (James), Padfoot (Sirius), Moony (Lupin) and Wormtail (Peter) while they were at Hogwarts. It showed the secret passages in and out of Hogwarts. The map also showed where people are by the use of named dots. The map can be viewed by saying "I solemnly swear that i am up to no good". The map can be made invisible (only the parchment will be seen) if one says "mischief managed". One has to tap a wand on the parchment while saying both the phrases.
