Villain

A villain is a bad person. Villains are usually found in fiction, such as books and movies. The audience do not usually like the villain and they support the hero or heroine. In some movies and books (such as the movie Ocean's Eleven), the villain is a good person and the hero/heroine is bad (such as a robber). When used in comic books, they are depicted as super-villains. Super-villains usually hold some kind of unnatural force.
