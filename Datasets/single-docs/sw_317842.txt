Tonga at the Olympics

Tonga has been in seven Olympic Summer Games. They have never been in the Winter Games. 

Tonga was the smallest independent nation to win an Olympic medal. Super Heavyweight Boxer Paea Wolfgram won a silver medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Tonga wanted to enter a delegation for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Tonga Amateur Sports Association (TASA) said they had one athlete to compete in the luge event. In December 2008, two male athletes were selected to travel to Germany for training, but only one of them would be at the Olympics. Bruno Banani was selected as Tonga's candidate. He failed to qualify by crashing in the final round of qualifications.
