List of soups

Soups have been made since ancient times. This page lists a selection of well-known soups from the various cuisines around the world. They are sorted by the type of soup.

Some soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid; these are categorised below as "chunky". A broth is a flavoured liquid usually made from boiling a meat and bone or vegetable for a period of time in a stock. A common type of broth is consomm√©. A potage is a category of thick soups, stews or porridges. In some of them, meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they turn into a thick mush.

Bisques are creamy soups traditionally made with shellfish, but can be made with any type of seafood. The base of cream soups is dairy. Chowders are thick soups usually containing some type of starch. Coulis were originally meat juices, and now are thick purees. Some soups are only ever served cold, and other soups can be served cold as an option.
