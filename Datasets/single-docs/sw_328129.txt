Salvatore Cammarano

Salvatore Cammarano (also Salvadore) (19 March 1801 - 17 July 1852) was an Italian librettist and playwright. He is probably best known for writing the text of "Lucia di Lammermoor" (1835) for Gaetano Donizetti. He was born and died in Naples.

For Donizetti he also wrote "L'assedio di Calais" (1836), "Belisario" (1836), "Pia de' Tolomei" (1837), "Roberto Devereux" (1837), "Maria de Rudenz" (1838), "Poliuto" (1838), and "Maria di Rohan" (1843). For Giuseppe Persiani he wrote "Ines de Castro".

For Verdi he wrote "Alzira" (1845), "La battaglia di Legnano" (1849) and "Luisa Miller" (1849). He had almost finished his libretto for "Il trovatore" (1853) when he died in July 1852. It was completed by Leone Emanuele Bardare. Cammarano started a libretto for William Shakespeare's "King Lear", named "Re Lear". He died before completing it. A scenario survives.
