The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour is the number one tier professional tennis tour for a women's tennis competition. The 2014 WTA Tour calendar consists of the four Grand Slam tournaments (organised by the International Tennis Federation (ITF)), and fifty regular tournaments, the Fed Cup (organised by the ITF), and the year-end championships (the WTA Tournament of Champions and the WTA Tour Championships). Also included in the 2014 calendar is the Hopman Cup, which does not distribute ranking points, and is organised by the ITF. The season begins on 30 December 2013 and will end on 9 November 2014.

The tournaments are played on a squared flat surface, called a tennis court. The measurements of a tennis court are described and monitored by the ITF and the court is long, wide. Its width is for singles matches and for doubles matches. Tennis is played on a variety of court types and each type has its own aspects that control how the sport is played. There are four main types of courts based on what's used to build the court surface, clay, hard, grass and carpet courts with the ITF rating five different speed ratings from slow to fast.
