Watarru Indigenous Protected Area

The Watarru Indigenous Protected Area is an area of 1.2 million hectares in the north west corner of South Australia. It is in the Great Victoria Desert. It is the traditional land of the Pitjantjatjara, Ngaanyatjarra and Yankunytjatjara peoples. These people are known as Anangu.

The area was made an Indigenous Protected Area in June 2000. It is managed by the Anangu according to their traditional laws and practices known as Tjukurpa. The environment has not been damaged by cattle grazing or other farming practices. The Anangu are working with scientists to develop ways of dealing with feral animals including cats, foxes and camels.
