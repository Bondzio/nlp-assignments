Crab-eating Frog

The Crab-eating Frog ("Fejervarya cancrivora"), is also known as the Asian Brackish Frog, Mangrove Frog and the Rice Field Frog. It is a frog native to south-eastern Asia including the Philippines and more rarely as far west as Orissa in India. Populations of the frog have been introduced into New Guinea and Guam.

The Crab-eating Frog lives in mangrove forests, in river estuaries, swamps, and other wet areas. It also lives in man-made places like rice fields and roadside ditches.
