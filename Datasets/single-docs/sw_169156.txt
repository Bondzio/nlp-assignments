Pane sciocco

"Pane sciocco" (also called in Tuscany "pane toscano" ) is a variety of bread very common in Tuscany and in Umbria, two regions in Italy. Differently from the others kinds of Italian bread, pane sciocco doesn't have salt. Probably the reason why there is no salt in the pane sciocco comes from the 1600s when salt was a rare product with a high cost. Pane sciocco is often eaten with typically Tuscan ham or sausages, famous for being salty.
