Quranism

Quranism ( ) is a denomination in Islam that believes the Qur'an to be the only source of guidance in Islam. It generally rejects the authority of the hadiths. Such Muslims do not necessarily reject the authenticity of hadiths, but do criticize the hadith claiming that such religious literature is not endorsed by the Quran, with some claiming that text collections are an innovative bid'ah. Overall, the ideological stance of Quranists is that solely the Qur'an holds authority over Islam and this is based on numerous verses stating that the Qur'an is fully detailed. Furthermore, Quranism is often associated with rationalism as Quranist believe in a god under the guidelines of universal logic. Quranist often state that all Abrahamic religions are one deriving this idea from the word 'Islam' meaning submission to god. Quranists are also very open to non-beleivers and atheists as according to the Qur'an, believing a non-beleiver is allowed so long as one doesn't hide the truth. Henceforth, one is only accustomed to be a beleiver when having found convincing evidence of god.
