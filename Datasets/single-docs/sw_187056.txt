Tteokguk

Tteokguk is a traditional food of Korea. It is eaten on January 1 to celebrate Seollal, the Korean New Year.

Tteokguk is a soup made from tteok ( a sweet Korean rice cake), sliced cooked eggs, ground meat, "mandu", leek, and onion.

There are some stories about the origin of tteokguk. Some say that "The first day of year should be solemn and clean, so people eat white colored food". And others suggest "People hope for pureness and longevity by eating tteokguk." There is also a popular saying that "eating tteokguk on New Year's day makes you grow one year older" - the Korean equivalent of "a pinch to grow an inch!" perhaps.
