Pancor Jackhammer

The Pancor Jackhammer is a fully automatic, rotary magazine, 12 gauge shotgun. Designed in 1984 by John Anderson, and patented in 1987. The concept of a fully automatic shotgun has not taken hold with the military, or with law enforcement, due to the difficulty of controlling such a weapon. Only three prototypes were constructed, with two of the three exploding during testing; only one survives today, in the hands of a private collector. However, the shotgun's futuristic appearance has made it popular in action films and video games.
