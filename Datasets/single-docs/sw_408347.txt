2013 Bodh Gaya blasts

On July 7, 2013, nine bombs exploded in and around the Mahabodhi Temple complex. The temple is a UNESCO World heritage site in Bodh Gaya, India. Five people, including two monks, were injured by the blasts. There were many other devices found but did not explode. These were turned off when found. 

The "vihara" was not damaged by the attacks. The holy tree where the Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment was not harmed. There have been arrests made. However, no party have claim responsibility for the attack. International figures from the Dalai Lama to Aung San Suu Kyi have expressed their concern.
