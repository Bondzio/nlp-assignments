She made her stage debut in her hometown on Christmas Eve 1952, as Violetta in "La traviata". After winning first place in a singing competition, she was invited to sing Violetta at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan on July 2, 1953, which led to her debut at La Scala, the following December, as Walter in Catalani's "La Wally", opposite Renata Tebaldi and Mario Del Monaco. She quickly appeared in several other cities throughout Italy.

She sang in Cairo in 1956 and at The Stoll Theatre in London in 1957. That same year, she replaced Maria Callas in "La sonnambula" at the Edimburg Festival to considerable acclaim.

Scotto was mostly known for the Italian repertoire of which she sang a wide range of roles from bel canto to verismo. Although essentially a lyric soprano, as the years went on she tackled more dramatic roles in operas such as "Norma", "Macbeth", "La Gioconda", "Tosca", etc. 

After retiring from the stage, she turned to teaching, coaching and stage directing. She is married to violonist Lorenzo Anselmi since 1960 and has two children.
