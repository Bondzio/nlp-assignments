Cryptoclidus

Cryptoclidus was a plesiosaur, an aquatic reptile up to 13 feet (4 m) long. It had curved, interlocking teeth, a wide skull, and large, flexible, paddle-like flippers. The fragile head and teeth could not deal with large prey. That suggests a diet of small, soft-bodied animals such as squid and small shoaling fish.

"Cryptoclidus" fossils have been found in England, France, Russia and possibly South America.

"Cryptoclidus" was named by Seeley in 1892. The type species is "C. eurymerus".
