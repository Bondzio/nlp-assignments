Stygimoloch

Stygimoloch was a plant-eating dinosaur that had bony spikes and knobs on its skull. This bipedal dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million to 65 million years ago.

"Stygimoloch" are ornithischian dinosaurs that had thick, domed, spiked skulls. Pachycephalosaurs probably engaged in head-butting both as a defense and in intra-species rivalry.
