Second baseman

Second base, or "2B", is the second of four places on a baseball field which must be touched in order by a base runner before he can score a run for that player's team. A second baseman is the baseball player who guards second base. Also called "second bagger", the second baseman often has quick hands and feet. He needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly. He must be able to make the turn on a double play. Also, shortstops and second basemen are usually right-handed. This makes it easier to turn a double play. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.

Current second basemen include Chase Utley, Robinson Cano, Dustin Pedroia, Orlando Hudson, Aaron Hill and Ben Zobrist.
