List of countries by population density

This is a list of countries and dependencies ranked by human population density, and measured by the number of human inhabitants per square kilometre or square mile. The list includes sovereign states and self-governing dependent territories based upon the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. The list also includes but does not rank unrecognized but de facto independent countries. The figures in the following table are based on areas including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Data are estimates for July 2005, taken from the United Nations World Prospects Report (2004 revision), unless stated differently.
Names of dependent territories as well as recognized states with no or limited control over their territory are shown in italics.

Source: Unless otherwise specified (or unless entered in error without stating the data source) figures for Population and Population Density figures are taken from year 2005 data in United Nations World Population Prospects (2004 revision). Area figures given here are taken from various (usually unstated) sources.

England officially became the second most crowded major country in the EU in 2008, according to figures released by the British Office for National Statistics. Only Malta, an island city state with a population that is no bigger than Bristol, had more people. Another study in 2010 by the British House of Commons library confirmed this, although their numbers for the Netherlands are different from those used by the Luxembourg-based Eurostat. The results are different because Eurostat calculates population density using only land surface area, whereas the British House of Commons library includes the 18.41 percent of the surface area of the Netherlands which is water.
