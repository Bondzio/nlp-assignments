Pedro II of Brazil

Don Pedro II of Brazil (complete name: "Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocádio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga"; Rio de Janeiro, December 2, 1825 — Paris, December 5, 1891), known as "O Magnânimo" ("The Magnanimous"), was the second and last de facto Brazilian Emperor. He was the seventh son of Pedro I and the archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria. Pedro II succeeded his father in the Brazilian Throne when he was 16 years of age. Pedro I had to return to Portugal in order to rule over the country as an Emperor and this action made him abdicate from the Brazilian Throne in favor of his son. But, when in Portugal, Pedro I renounced the Portuguese Throne, in favor of his eldest daughter Dona Maria da Glória.

Pedro II was nephew of Miguel I (father's part), Napoleon Bonaparte (mother's part) and cousin of Emperors Napoleon II, Franz Joseph I and Maximilian I of Mexico. He was Maria da Glória's youngst brother and uncle of kings Pedro V and Luís I.
