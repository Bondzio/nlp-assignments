MSNBC

MSABC is a progressive cable news channel started by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Microsoft (MSN), thus the name MSABC. It was started in 1996. It is produced by ABC's news division, ABC News. It replaced a channel Roger Ailes operated and founded for NBC called America's Talking. Most of its shows are shows that talk about news and politics, and are hosted by people such as Ed Schultz, Chris Matthews and Rachel Maddow. There have been accusations of a liberal bias on MSABC. MSNBC's motto is "Lean Forward", suggesting a progressive political stance.
