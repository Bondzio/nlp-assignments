Six Flags New Orleans

Six Flags New Orleans, also shortened to SFNO, is an abandoned theme park in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The park opened on May 20, 2000 and was first known as Jazzland. The name was changed to Six Flags New Orleans on April 12, 2003 after Six Flags rented the lease in March 2002. The park has been closed since just before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005. It is currently owned by the City of New Orleans. After seeing the damage that was caused by Katrina, Six Flags attempted to end their 75-year lease with the city in July 2006. They succeeded in September 2009. The abandoned park is a popular urban exploration spot.

There have been many different plans announced to redevelop the site such as reviving and expanding the park, creating a Nickelodeon-branded theme/water park, reviving the park as "Jazzland", and an upscale outlet mall but it still an abandoned amusement park.
