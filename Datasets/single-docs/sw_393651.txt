The plot centers around Fox McCloud restoring the remote Dinosaur Planet by finding pieces that have broken off of it.

Unlike other "Star Fox" games, "Star Fox Adventures" plays as an action-adventure game similar to "". Instead of a blaster, Fox uses a staff as his weapon. Fox can find power-ups for his staff that allow it to fire projectiles, freeze enemies, and reach areas that he cannot reach on his own. Fox cannot jump unless he runs off of something, in the same way that Link jumps in "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time".
