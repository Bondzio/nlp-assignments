Susan B. Anthony

Susan Brownell Anthony (February 15, 1820 - March 13, 1906) was an American women's rights leader. At 17, she became a schoolteacher, but soon became involved in activism regarding slavery and drinking. By the 1850s, she was working closely with Elizabeth Cady Stanton for women's rights, including the vote. She edited a newspaper called "The Revolution" for several years. In 1872, she was arrested for trying to vote. For many years, she was the leader of the National Women's Suffrage Association, which wanted women to have the right to vote. The 19th Amendment (change to the U.S. Constitution) was passed in 1920, 14 years after Anthony's death on March 13, 1906. Anthony later became the first woman on a U.S. coin. This coin was a dollar coin.
