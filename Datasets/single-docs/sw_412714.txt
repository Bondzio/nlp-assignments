Buddy Scott

Kenneth "Buddy" Scott (January 9, 1935 â€“ February 5, 1994) was an American blues guitarist.

Scott was born in Goodman, Mississippi on January 9, 1935. His family came from Chicago, Illinois. Buddy formed a group called Scotty and the Rib Tips and recorded several singles late in the 1960s. They played locally in Chicago blues establishments for over a generation.

Scott signed a recording contract with Verve in 1993, and released his debut major-label release, "Bad Avenue", that year, but died of stomach cancer in Chicago, Illinois, not long after the album's release.
