My arcade series

The My arcade consoles are a line of unauthorized handheld Nintendo entertainment system clones that attach to a TV set manufactured by various companies and sold by DreamGEAR,LLC.Most,if not all of these were manufactured in east Asia and mostly are of low quality. The consoles are most common in places like Walgreens and Dollar stores,but excess inventory is sometimes sold in more mainstream stores like Meijer and Walmart. In 2012,DreamGEAR released My arcade portable gaming systems to stores which are 16-bit instead of 8-bit,and seem to use an unauthorized implementation of the Game Boy Advance hardware. Many of the games found on these handhelds contain copyright infringement. Voice clips are stolen from Homer simpson and The Flintstones,as well as games using copyrighted characters like Elmo. Also,they repeat games just with different textures and sounds.
