United States presidential election, 1976

This election was between former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford. 

Jimmy Carter won the election by 297 electoral votes. Incumbent president Gerald Ford got 240 votes. A faithless elector from Washington voted for Ronald Reagan, who would win the 1980 election.

This election followed the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. It is the last election to have a Democratic candidate to get a good vote in American South. The American South is most known to be Republican.
