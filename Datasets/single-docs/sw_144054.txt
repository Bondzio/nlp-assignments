Islamic terrorism

Islamic terrorism is a kind of terrorism. The terrorists claim their religion, Islam, or how they interpret it is their motivation. 

Some Islamic scholars say that it is wrong to kill innocent people. Suicide is something the Koran states is wrong. Islamic terrorist groups include Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. It is stated in the Qur'an that "You must not go too far; Allah loves not those who do.""You must resist them until the persecution is done away, and prayers are only to Allah; if they cease fighting, you must not invade anyone but the unrighteous."
