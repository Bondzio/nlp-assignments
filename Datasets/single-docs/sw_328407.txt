Norwich School

Norwich School (before called King Edward VIâ€™s Grammar School) is a co-ed (girls and boys) private school in Norwich, England. It is one of the oldest schools in the world, going back to at least 1096. Norwich School has one of the best academic records in East Anglia. "The Daily Telegraph" ranked the school's A-Level results as 74th in 2006, 55th in 2007 and 80th in 2008 amongst independent schools in the UK. In each case, the rank was the highest in Norfolk and Suffolk. 

The school used to be for boys only. It began admitting girls below the Sixth Form in September 2008. All year groups had girls in them by September 2010. 

Norwich School is an Anglican school. It has a long relationship with Norwich Cathedral, which it uses for morning assemblies and some annual events. Many famous people were taught at Norwich School, like Horatio Nelson, who has a house named after him. 

There are eight houses: Brooke, Coke, Seagrim, Nelson, Parker, Repton, School and Valpy.
