Alphablocks

Alphablocks is a British CGI-animated children's educational television programme that tries to teach children how to spell with the use of animated blocks representing each letter. It is animated by Blue-Zoo and produced by Alphablocks Ltd. Once the Alphablocks discover that whenever they make a word it comes to life, many new adventures in Alphaland can be created. This is meant to help preschool children with learning the alphabet, spelling, reading and writing.


In January 2017, "Numberblocks" debuted on CBeebies. This new show takes on a similar approach to "Alphablocks", though with numbers instead of the letters of the alphabet. Like "Alphablocks", It is also animated by Blue-Zoo.
