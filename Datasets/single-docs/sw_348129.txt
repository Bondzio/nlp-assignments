Dermestidae

Dermestidae are a family of Coleoptera. They are also known as skin beetles, larder beetle, hide beetle, leather beetle, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are 500 to 700 species of Dermestids. They can reach up to 1-12 mm. Adults have round oval-shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. They can fit into deep grooves. 

Most Dermestids are scavengers that feed on dry animal or plant material. These materials include their skin (or pollen), animal hair, feathers, dead insects, and fibers. Members of Dermestids can be found living in dead animals and feeding on them. Others can be found living in mammal, bird, bee, or wasp nests. "Thaumaglossa" only lives in the egg of mantids. Many Trogoderma species are pests that eats grain.

Because most of these beetles are found living in dead animals, they are studied in forensic entomology. They study these beetles with criminal investigations. Some species are pests. They can damage natural fibers in homes and businesses. Dermestids are used by history museums to clean animal skeletons. Some dermestid species (the bow bugs), eats the bow hair of the violin.
