Metroid II: Return of Samus

Samus Aran goes to a planet called SR388 when the Galactic Federation told her to exterminate the Metroids that live on it. After exploring the underground areas of the planet and killing almost every Metroid, she fights and kills the Metroid Queen. Afterwards, a Baby Metroid hatches and thinks Samus is its mom. Samus takes the Baby Metroid with her when she leaves the planet.

The player sees very little of SR388's surface, and the game is almost entirely underground. The areas are dark with rocky platforms, and has a high amount of lava close to the surface.

"Metroid II" takes "Metroid"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay and adds new stuff. It uses the Beams, Morph Ball, Missiles, and special jumps, but adds new stuff as well. The game is very nonlinear and lets the player explore the world somewhat freely. Throughout the world, Samus finds enemies and new power-ups.
