Flight attendant

In aviation, flight attendants — also known as cabin crew, stewards, air hosts/hostesses, or stewardesses, — are members of a cabin crew employed by airlines. They make sure that the passengers on commercial flights (or, sometimes, business jets) are safe and comfortable during the flight.
