Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers are a professional American football team based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. They are currently part of the Western Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The team first played in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League. The club spent its first season in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego in 1961, becoming the San Diego Chargers and spending 56 seasons in that city before announcing a return to the Los Angeles area in January 2017. The team will play the 2017 and 2018 seasons at the StubHub Center, a soccer stadium in suburban Carson that serves as home to the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer, before joining the Los Angeles Rams at the new stadium that the Rams are building in another Los Angeles suburb, Inglewood.

Since 2013, Phillip Rivers has been the quarterback. The original team logo was a charging horse. Over time, the logo evolved into a lightning bolt, a play on a different meaning of "charge". The team wears navy blue jerseys and white pants for most home games, white jerseys and navy pants for road games, and powder blue jerseys with white pants for designated home games. There is a gold bolt on the jersey that is outlined in both powder blue and navy.
