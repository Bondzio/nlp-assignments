Fine Wind, Clear Morning

Fine Wind, Clear Morning (also known as South Wind, Clear Sky and Red Fuji) is a woodblock print made by Hokusai. 

The art work was printed somewhere between 1830 and 1832 which was during the Edo period. It is the second print in the series, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It shows that in early autumn when the wind is southerly and when the sky is clear, the rising sun can turn Mount Fuji red.
