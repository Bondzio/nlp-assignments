Human settlement

Settlement refers to the action of people coming together to live in an area. Settlement is a general term used in archaeology, geography, history and other subjects for a place where people live (either permanently or temporarily). When they come from far away it is sometimes called a colony. The term may include hamlets, suburbs, towns and cities. Nomadic people do not settle.
