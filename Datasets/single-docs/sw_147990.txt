British Rail Class 206

The British Rail Class 206 or 3R was a type of Diesel electric multiple unit (DEMU) first created in 1964. They were not 'built' as such but rather re-formed from Class 201 and EPB vehicles for use on Reading-Redhill-Tonbridge (North Downs Line) services. Six three-car sets were created, numbered 1201â€“1206. They were known, colloquially, as 'Tadpole' units because of the contrast between the standard profile of the 416 'head' and the narrow body shape of the 206 'tail'.
