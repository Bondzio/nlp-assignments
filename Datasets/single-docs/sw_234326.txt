Wicked

Wicked is a Broadway musical. It is loosely based on characters and concepts created by L. Frank Baum in his children's series of Wizard of Oz books, the 1939 MGM movie, "The Wizard of Oz", and the 1995 novel, "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" by Gregory Maguire. 

Winnie Holzman wrote the musical's book. Stephen Schwartz wrote the music and lyrics. "Wicked" premiered on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003. It won several awards, including three Tonys.
