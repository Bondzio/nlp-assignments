Treaty of London (1913)

The Treaty of London was a treaty signed on 30 May. It was to move the borders of countries after the First Balkan War.

The Balkan League won the war from the Ottoman Empire. The Balkan League was Serbia, Greece, Kingdom of Bulgaria, and Montenegro. One important border to decide was Albania. There was a declaration of independence by Albania on 28 November 1912. All of the Ottoman Empire, except Albania, was given to the Balkan League.

Because not everyone was happy with the Treaty of London, the Second Balkan War started on June 13. Peace came after theTreaty of Bucharest on 12 August 1913.
