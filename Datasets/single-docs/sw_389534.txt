Virtual International Authority File

The Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) is a joint project of several national libraries and operated by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).

In 1998, the project was started by the German National Library and the U.S. Library of Congress.

In 2003, VIAF was established.

The file numbers are being added to some Wikipedia articles about people.
