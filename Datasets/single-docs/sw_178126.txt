Missa in angustiis

The Missa in Angustiis ("Mass for troubled times") is one of fourteen masses written by Joseph Haydn. It is also called Nelson mass, because Haydn wrote it after he learnt that Lord Horatio Nelson won a battle against Napoleon Bonaparte. It was written in 1798. It is one of the six masses Haydn wrote towards the end of his life.
