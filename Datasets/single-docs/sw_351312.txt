Baise-moi

Baise-moi is a 2000 French crime drama thriller movie. It was called Rape Me in the United States, where it was released without an MPAA rating. In Australia, "Baise-moi" was rated R18 at first, but was then refused classification due to content. This movie got mixed reviews from critics in many countries.

The title does not mean "kiss me", and absolutely it does not mean "rape me". It means "fuck me". It is about a sex-and-violence spree by two young women. The sex scenes are apparently real, rather than simulated, and the film has been banned in many countries.
