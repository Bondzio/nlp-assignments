Coefficient

In mathematics, a coefficient is a constant multiplicative factor of a certain object. For example, the coefficient in "9x" is "9". 

The object can be such things as a variable, a vector, a function, etc. In some cases, the objects and the coefficients are indexed in the same way, leading to expressions such as:
where "a" is the coefficient of the variable "x" for each "n" = 1, 2, 3, â€¦
