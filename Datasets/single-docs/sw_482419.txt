Sindhi Wikipedia

Sindhi Wikipedia (, ) is the Sindhi language edition of Wikipedia. It started in February 2006. As of July 2015, it had more than 3,000 articles.

At first, Sindhi Wikipedia faced technical problems with the Sindhi script font, but this matter is mostly settled; some unsolved areas remain. Sindhi is written in Perso-Arabic script, a right-to-left writing system. As a result, users sometimes need to configure their operating systems and web browsers accordingly.
