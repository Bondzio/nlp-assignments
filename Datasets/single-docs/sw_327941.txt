Type 90 75 mm field gun

This artillery piece was planned to replace the Type 38 75 mm field gun in front line combat units. However, Type 38s continued to be used.

Before World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army mainly had Krupp cannons from Germany. After the Versailles Treaty, the Japanese considered other options including field guns designed by Schneider et Cie from France. 

In 1931, IJA began to use the "Type 90" which was based on Schneider designs.

The Type 90 was not considered successful.

The Type 90 75 mm field gun was used in Manchukuo. It was used against the Soviet Red Army at the Battle of Nomonhan.
