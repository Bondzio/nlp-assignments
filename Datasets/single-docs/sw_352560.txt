Conus beatrix

Conus beatrix is a species of sea snail. It is a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae (the cone snails and their allies).

Like all species within the genus "Conus", these snails are predatory and poisonous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, so live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.

It is feared by most other aquatic snails, because few other species have the ability to sting. 

Conus beatrix lives only in the seas of the Philippines.
