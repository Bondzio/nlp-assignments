Dragon Fountain

The Dragon Fountain at the Palace of Versailles was executed by Gaspard Marsy in 1667. The fountain lies at the end of the northern axis between the Water Walk and Neptune Fountain. The Dragon Fountain shoots a jet of water 90 feet into the air. The Dragon Fountain was only operated when it was known the King would be present. All of the other fountains were required to be turned off for this spectacle to be accomplished. At other times it was regulated to a 35 foot jet. Statues of children mounted upon swans bedevil the Dragon.
