Super battleship (warship)

Super battleship is an unofficial class of battleships. It includes the largest types constructed or planned with a displacing of roughly 60,000 tons or more. Only two such battleships were ever made. Many more were planned by several navies of the world before and during the Second World War. Their design included thick armor and large guns. They were thought to be the ideal warships for naval battle. The success of the aircraft carriers compromised their use. Only two were ever built (both by the Japanese Empire). Both were sunk during World War II.
