Bulgarian language

Bulgarian ("", [ˈbɤ̞lɡarski ɛˈzik]) is an Indo-European language. It is spoken mainly in Bulgaria and parts of Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine and Moldova. The Bulgarian language is similar to the Macedonian and the Serbian languages, which are part of the South Slavic branch of Slavic languages. There are nearly 9 million people in 2011 who use Bulgarian as their main language. 

Bulgarian is a part of the so-called Balkan "Sprachbund" or linguistic group, which also includes Greek, Macedonian, Romanian, Albanian and Torlakian dialect of the Serbian language. This does not mean the languages are necessarily related, but that they share certain loanwords and grammatical characteristics due to frequent contact over the years.
