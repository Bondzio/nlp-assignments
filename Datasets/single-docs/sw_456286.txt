Opisthokont

Opisthokonts are a superkingdom of the Eukaryota, including the animals. It is a group of unikonts.

There are several classifications of the eukaryotes which are being actively discussed. Each of them divides the domain Eukaryota into five groups, but there is disagreement as to the details. 

The Opisthokonta is thought to be a monophyletic clade, and therefore superior to the Unikonta as as taxonomic term.
