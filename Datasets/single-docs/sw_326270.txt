Oneota

Oneota is the name archaeologists have given to a culture found in the United States. Oneota was mostly in what is now Wisconsin and neighboring states. It lasted from about AD 900 until about 1700. Archaeologists think Oneota became historic Macro-Siouan tribes such as the Ioway. A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk is not certain.
