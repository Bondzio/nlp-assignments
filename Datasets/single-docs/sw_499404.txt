Fresh Horses is the sixth studio album by American country music artist Garth Brooks. It was released on November 21, 1995. "Fresh Horses" peaked at #2 on the "Billboard" 200 chart, and #1 on the Top Country Albums chart.

The album had a worldwide radio ban until it was available to buy. Only the two singles issued ("She's Every Woman" and "The Fever") were allowed to be played before this date, the latter of which was a new country-rock version of an old Aerosmith song). Through 2006, approximately 7 million copies have been sold in the U.S.

Brooks commented on the album saying:

""Everyone was expecting this album to be pop. Everyone said we were leaving (country). For the first time ever, I was involved (in writing) in eight of the 10 cuts, so it's a huge reflection of myself. It's the things I enjoy singing about. I got to sing about the band on the road, I got to sing about cowboys, and more importantly, the women who put up with those cowboys."'


“The Limited Series” (1998) of the album inserted a cover of Bob Dylan’s “To Make You Feel My Love” between tracks 7 and 8.

Fresh Horses peaked at #2 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, and peaked #1 on the Top Country Albums, becoming his sixth #1 Country album. In November 2006, Fresh Horses was certified 7 x Platinum by the RIAA.
