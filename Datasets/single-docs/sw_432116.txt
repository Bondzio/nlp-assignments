Queen Charlotte, British Columbia

Queen Charlotte (or Queen Charlotte City) is a village in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located in the south end of Graham Island in the Haida Gwaii group of islands. It is on Skidegate Inlet.

The population of Queen Charlotte was 944 in 2011. The town was first established 1908 when the first sawmill in the islands began operating. The villagers worked to help supply Allied war planes with lumber during World War II. Within the year, three general stores, a drug and clothing store, two hotels, a pool hall, a boarding house, a barbershop and the local newspaper started operating in the village. The town gained a stable economy from the quick growth in the timber industry during the Great Depression.
