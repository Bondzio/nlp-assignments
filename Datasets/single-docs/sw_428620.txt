WWE Survivor Series is a professional wrestling video game developed by Natsume and published by THQ. The game was released for the Game Boy Advance.

It was released on October 12, 2004 in North America and November 19, 2004 in Europe. The game was the sequel to WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 which was released in 2002. It was the last WWE video game to be released on a Nintendo handheld console until 2007 when WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was released on the Nintendo DS. 

IGN rated the game a 6.0 out of 10 and said "Even with its limitations and gameplay quirks, it's still somewhat satisfying to play, especially in multiplayer link mode, and especially if you haven't experienced the game two years ago.‚Äù

GameSpot gave the game a 5.6 out of 10 and stated "This is almost an exact duplicate of WWE Road to Wrestlemania X8 from two years ago, warts and all."
