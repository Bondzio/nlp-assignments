2011 Sindh floods

The 2011 Sindh floods started during mid-August 2011 because of a lot of rain in Sindh, Eastern Balochistan, and Southern Punjab. The floods have caused a lot of damage. 270 people died, and 5.3 million people were affected. 1.2 million homes were sunk. Sindh is considered a "good" region and often called the "breakfast" of the country. The damage caused by the floods in the area is large. At least 1.7 million acres of land have been ruined because of the flooding. The flooding is the worst since the 2010 floods in Pakistan.

In the month of July, Pakistan had low monsoon rains, however in August and September the country received "above normal" monsoon rains. A strong weather pattern entered the areas of Sindh from the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat in August and gained strength with the passage of time and caused heavy downpours. The four-week long continuous rains have created floods in Sindh that have never been seen before.
