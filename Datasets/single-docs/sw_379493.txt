Jiroemon Kimura

Jiroemon Kimura (木村 次郎右衛門, 19 April 1897 – 12 June 2013) was a Japanese supercentenarian, who has been listed by the Guinness World Records as the oldest living person in the world since the death of Dina Manfredini on December 17, 2012. Kimura became the oldest man ever verified by the Guinness World Records after his lifespan became longer than that of Christian Mortensen on December 28, 2012. He was the last living man who was born before the 1900s, as well as the oldest and last verified person ever to have been born in the year 1897.

Kimura was born as Kinjiro Miyake (三宅 金治郎 Miyake Kinjirō) in the fishing village of Kamiukawa. After he finished school at the age of 14, he worked for local post offices for over 45 years until he retired in 1962 at the age of 65. In the 1920's, he also worked as a government communications worker in Korea, which was at the time a colony of Japan. 

After he returned from Korea, he married Yae Kimura and changed his name to Jiroemon Kimura, since his wife's family lacked a male heir. They were married until her death in 1978 and had seven children, five of which are still living. He lives in Kyōtango, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan with his eldest son's widow and grandson's widow.

According to a nephew of his, Jiroemon Kimura's date of birth was actually 19 March 1897, but was recorded in error as 19 April 1897 in 1955. Guinness World Records however recognise him according to his records as being born on 19 April 1897, aged 116. Kimura was hospitalized for pneumonia in May 2013 and slowly recovered, but his health began to decline over the weeks. This is similar to the situation regarding Shigechiyo Izumi, who was originally thought to have died aged 120 years, 237 days old, until it was discovered he had been confused with his brother.

Kimura died on June 12, 2013 in a hospital in Kyōtango, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan from natural causes. He was 116 years and 54 days old.
