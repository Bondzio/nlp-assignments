Provinces of Sweden

The Provinces of Sweden () are the 25 histrocial regions of Sweden. Back in the Middle Ages, Swedish provinces would have their own laws, but in 1634, the counties of Sweden were established, and the historical provinces are no longer around when it comes to administration or politics. However, they still play an important part within culture and regional identity.
