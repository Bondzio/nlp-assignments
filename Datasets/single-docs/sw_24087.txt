Breton language

Breton ("", in Breton) is a Celtic language spoken in Brittany, in the north-west of France. Breton is closely related to the Cornish language of Cornwall spoken in south-west Great Britain. It is less closely related to Welsh, and the Goidelic languages of Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. The Breton language has approximately 240,000 speakers, but this number is falling very quickly due to the French government's policy of using French. As such, Breton is considered to be an endangered language.
