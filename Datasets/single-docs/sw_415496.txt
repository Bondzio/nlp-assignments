Dyspraxia

Dyspraxia is a chronic disability that affects coordination. It is also known as developmental coordination disorder. 2-6% of people have dyspraxia. Four times as many males than females have it. It is sometimes called 'clumsy child syndrome', but adults have it too. People with dyspraxia (Dyspraxics) may have other disabilities such as ADHD or autism. 

There is no single cause of dyspraxia. It may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or sometimes teenage years. It cannot be cured: people who have it will live with it for life, however people are able to overcome it and find alternative ways to accomplish tasks which may usually be difficult without support. 


People who have developmental coordination disorder may also have one or more of these conditions:
