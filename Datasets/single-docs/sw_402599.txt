Hurricane Gert (1993)

Hurricane Gert was a destructive and very deadly tropical cyclone in September 1993. It struck Central America and Mexico. The storm affected almost the same region devastated by Hurricane Diana three years prior, except winds were a little stronger than for Diana. Winds for Gert were 105 miles per hour; ninety lives were lost, and forty three other people were missing due to Hurricane Gert. Despite the devastation, the name Gert was not retired in Spring of 1994.
