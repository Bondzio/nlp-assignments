Division of Bourke

The Division of Bourke was an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. It was set up for the first federal election in 1901. It was abolished in 1949. It was named for Sir Richard Bourke, who was Governor of New South Wales at the time of the founding of Melbourne. It was based in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, including Brunswick and Coburg. The National Library of Australia holds a map showing the boundaries of Bourke in 1912.
