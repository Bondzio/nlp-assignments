Santiago Ram贸n y Cajal

Santiago Ram贸n y Cajal 1 May 1852 18 October 1934) was a Spanish doctor. He shared the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Camillo Golgi for their work on the anatomy of the nervous system.

Ram贸n y Cajal worked on thin slices of brain tissue which were laid on microscope slides and stained with silver. The stain was invented by Golgi, who shared the Nobel Prize with him.

Ram贸n y Cajal's investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain were original: he is considered by many to be the father of modern neuroscience. He was skilled at drawing, and hundreds of his illustrations of brain cells are still used for educational purposes today.
