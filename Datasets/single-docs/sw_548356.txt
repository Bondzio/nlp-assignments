God Bless America

"God Bless America" is an American patriotic song. It was written by Irving Berlin in 1918. The song was revised in 1938. The latter was recorded by Kate Smith; it became her signature song. 

In 1938, with the rise of Adolf Hitler, Berlin felt it was time to revive the song. On Armistice Day, 1938, Kate Smith performed the song on the radio.

The song is played at Major League Baseball games. 

CÃ©line Dion and LeAnn Rimes did cover versions of the song.
