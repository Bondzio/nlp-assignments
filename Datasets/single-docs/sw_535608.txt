Cruz is the head of the "Fundación Sobrevivientes" (Survivors' Foundation), a women's rights organization in Guatemala City.

Norma Cruz was born in Guatemala City in 1962. Her father was a shoemaker and her mother was a cook. As a teenager, Cruz was a student leader and a missionary. When she was 15 years old, Cruz joined a convent. Two years later, she left the convent, because she wanted a more political life. 

Cruz started the organization "Fundación Sobrevivientes" on July 3, 1996. It started as a women's support center. Now it has a shelter for up to 20 women, teenagers, and children. In 2009, 110 people stayed at the shelter. The organization also gives legal help to women who want to take legal action in the courts.
