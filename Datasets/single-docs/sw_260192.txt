Iron sulfide

Iron sulfide is the chemical compound FeS, a solid of metallic blackish color. It is made of iron and sulfide ions. It has iron in its +2 oxidation state. 

It is found in the ground as the mineral pyrite. It is shiny like a metal, but it does not conduct electricity. It can make sparks when it is powdered (ground finely). It does not always contains sulfide ions; sometimes it contains a mixture of sulfide and sulfur. When it is exposed to oxygen in air, it forms acids which pollute streams and rivers. It reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide gas. 

The term iron sulfide may refer to a range of chemical compounds composed of iron and sulfur.
