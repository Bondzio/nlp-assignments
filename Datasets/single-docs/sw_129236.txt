WWE Women's Championship (1956â€“2010)

The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Women's Championship was an official championship in World Wrestling Entertainment fought for by divas. The title was unified with the WWE Diva's Championship.

The WWE Women's Championship has descended from the National Wrestling Alliance World Women's Championship when The Fabulous Moolah became champion and held the title close to 30 years. The Title became inactive in 1990 when Rockin' Robin Vacated the Title after departing from the WWF. In 1993 Alundra Blayze won the Title after Winning a Tournament. However the Title became Inactive after Alundra Blayze dropped the Title into a Garbage Can live on WCW Monday Nitro this incident forced her to give up the title.

The WWE Women's Championship was then reactivated in September 1998 when Jacqueline Moore won a match against Sable.

Currently Michelle McCool, Mickie James, Melina Perez and Beth Phoenix are the only divas in the history of the WWE to hold both the WWE Women's Championship and WWE Divas Championship.

The final champion was Layla El who defeated Beth Phoenix in a two-on-one handicap match with Michelle McCool on Smackdown and McCool self-proclaimed herself as the co-Women's Champion. The title was unified with the WWE Diva's Championship on September 19, 2010 and retired.
