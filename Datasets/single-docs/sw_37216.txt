Helmut Kohl

Helmut Josef Michael Kohl (3 April 1930 â€“ 16 June 2017) was a German CDU politician.

From 1969 to 1976 he was the Minister President of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate and from 1982 to 1998 Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. Kohl helped to arrange the process of German reunification and participated considerably in the European unity process.

His involvement with the CDU donation affair, and in particular offences against party law is open to question.
