Root vegetable

Root vegetables are roots of plants, which are used as vegetables. In this context, the term "root" is used to refer to an underground part of the plant. This is not necessarily its root, in the biological sense.

Examples of root vegetables are carrots, potatoes, radishes, turnips, and onions.
