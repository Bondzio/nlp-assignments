Samuel Loomis

Dr. Samuel James "Sam" Loomis (March 13, 1922 â€“ c. October 29th, 1998) is an fictional British character in the "Halloween". He is the main good guy of "Halloween", "Halloween II", "", "" and "". Donald Pleasence plays the character of Dr. Loomis in all five movies relating to Michael Michael Myers from parts 1-2 and from parts 4-6 (He and Michael did not appear in part 3). 

From all the "Halloween franchise", he is thought to be as the archenemy to the series' central character and main villian, Michael Myers. In part six of the franchise, Dr. Loomis becomes the leader of an evil group which is why he does not appear in the other movies, but the main reason was that his portrayer Donald Pleasence died before part six was released. Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Loomis in the 2007 re-make, "Halloween" and in its sequel "Halloween II".

His name Samuel Loomis is based on John Gavin's character name from Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror movie "Psycho".
