Color of Night

Color of Night is a 1994 American erotic mystery thriller movie. It was released on August 19, 1994. It stars Bruce Willis, Jane March and Scott Bacula. "Color of Night" gained notoriety for sex scenes between Willis and March, which were somewhat graphic and explicit by mainstream standards. The character Rose (played by March) is a bisexual woman. The scenes led the MPAA to give "Color of Night" an NC-17 rating; certain scenes were then removed before release. "Color of Night" is rated R for sexual content, graphic violence and very strong language.
