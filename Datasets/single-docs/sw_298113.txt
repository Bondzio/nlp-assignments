Embioptera

Embioptera are order of insects, commonly known as webspinners, are a small group of mostly tropical and subtropical insects, classified under the subclass Pterygota. The group probably first appeared during the Jurassic and is well represented in Cretaceous amber. The common name webspinner comes from the insects' ability to spin silk from structures on their front legs. They use the silk to make a web-like pouch or gallery in which they live.
