Nintendo Switch

The Nintendo Switch is a video game console created by Nintendo. It was released worldwide on March 3, 2017. 

The Switch is a "hybrid" console. This means that the console can be inserted into a docking station, which will be connected to your television. It can also be removed from the docking station to be used as a handheld gaming device or it can be placed in a tabletop mode. It uses controllers called 'Joy-Cons' that attach to both sides of the console when in handheld mode, or can be attached to a grip when in docked television mode. There are also little buttons to press on the console too. Inside the joycons there are tons of features such as HD rumble which allows you to feel things inside the controller. Theres also a motion sensor on the bottom of the right joycon which is used a bit like the Nintendo Wii's sensors.

So far, are planning to be released. This includes , , and much more.
