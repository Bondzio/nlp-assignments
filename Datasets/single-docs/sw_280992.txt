Gifu Prefecture

Gifu is part of the T≈çkai region. Shirakawa in Gifu is a UNESCO's World Heritage Site.

In the Meiji period, Gifu Prefecture was created by merging several old provinces, including Hida Province and Mino Province.

"Gifu" may have been named by Oda Nobunaga.

Gifu shares borders with seven other prefectures: Aichi Prefecture, Fukui Prefecture, Ishikawa Prefecture, Mie Prefecture, Nagano Prefecture, Shiga Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture.




National parks cover about 18% of the total land area of the prefecture.

Otaki Limestone cave is one of the biggest limestone caves in Japan. There is no daylight inside, so you may feel that the air in there is very still. If you go there in summer, you may feel cool, and if you go there in winter, you may feel much warmer than outside of it. The walls are made of limestone and look milky white.

"Hidaichinomiya-Minashi jinja" is the main Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") in the prefecture.
