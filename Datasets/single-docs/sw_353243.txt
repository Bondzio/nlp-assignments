Wushu (sport)

Wushu is a sport that is originated from traditional Chinese martial arts. It was created in China after 1949. It was created to nationalize the practice of traditional Chinese martial arts. Most of the competitions had influences of martial arts. This was created by government committees. Wushu has become an international sport through the International Wushu Federation (IWUF). The IWUF holds the World Wushu Championships every two years. The first World Championships were held in 1991 in Beijing, which Yuan Wen Qing won.

Competitive wushu is made up of two disciplines: taolu (套路; "forms") and sanda (散打; sparring). Taolu involves martial art patterns and a series of movement. These are judged and given points according to specific rules. The movements could be stances, kicks, punches, balances, jumps, sweeps and throws. Competitive forms have time limits that can range from 1 minute, 20 seconds to over five minutes. Modern wushu competitors are trained in aerial techniques such as 540 and 720 and even 900 degree jumps and kicks.

Sanda (sometimes called sanshou or Lei tai) is a modern fighting method and sport. It was influenced by traditional Chinese boxing, Chinese wrestling and other Chinese grappling. Sanda has all the combat features of wushu. Sanda happens to be like kickboxing or Muay Thai. However, it involves more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu or form competitions.
