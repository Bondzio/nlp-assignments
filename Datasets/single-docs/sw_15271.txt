Herring

A herring is a small teleost fish of the genus "Cluptea". Best-known of this family is probably the Atlantic Herring. There are 15 different species of herring. When herrings migrate in the water they usually do this in large numbers; this is then called a "school" of herring. Like other fish, they do this for protection: see shoaling and schooling. 

Herrings can be eaten. They are often smoked or pickled. 

A red herring is used to describe a plot device in mystery fiction that leads the reader to a wrong solution.
