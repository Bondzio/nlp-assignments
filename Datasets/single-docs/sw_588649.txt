Abdul Halim Khaddam

Abdul Halim Khaddam ( (; born 15 September 1932) is a Syrian politician.

Khaddam was Vice President of Syria from 1984 to 2005. He was one of the few Sunni Muslims to make it to the top of the Alawite-dominated Syrian leadership. He was long known as a loyalist of Hafez al-Assad, and held a strong position within the Syrian government until he resigned his positions and fled the country in 2005 in protest against certain policies of Hafez's son and successor, Bashar al-Assad.

He served as interim President of Syria from 10 June 2000 to 17 July 2000 when Hafez al-Assad died in June 2000. He was later replaced by Bashar al-Assad.
