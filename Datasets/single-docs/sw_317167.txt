The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a video game made in 2011 for the Wii. Unlike other "The Legend of Zelda" games, it focuses more on combat, keeping the role-playing and puzzle elements seen in earlier games. The story is connected with the rest of the "Legend of Zelda" series, and this game is about how the master sword was made. The player travels between two worlds: Skyloft, an area in the sky with floating islands which is the main area in the game, and Hyrule, which is located on the Earth. It makes use of the Wii MotionPlus add-on for the Wii Remote. The player uses the Wii Remote to swing Link's sword.

Link is the hero in this game. Zelda is Link's childhood friend, and the heroine in the story. Ghirahim: is the bad person who schemes to revive an ancient evil boss.

A limited edition bundle with a gold Wii MotionPlus and a CD with orchestrated versions of the series' well-known music tracks was sold to mark the 25th anniversary of "The Legend of Zelda".
