Cartazini Biennial Art Award

The Prix Cartazini is a prize in contemporary art, sponsored by the Paris based Gallery Cartazini and made since 1999. It is made every two years, on the odd years.

In 2009 the award will be for 20 000 euros and as such is one of the largest art awards in the visual arts sector.
