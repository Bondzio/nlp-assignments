The U.S. has a powerful military that it can send out to protect countries or locations that are considered important to U.S. foreign policy. 

The U.S. Secretary of State is the same type of job as the job of foreign minister of other countries. The Secretary of State is responsible for diplomacy with other countries. Today, John Kerry is the U.S.'s Secretary of State. 

The President of the United States has the highest authority over foreign policy.
