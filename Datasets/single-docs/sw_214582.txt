Buster Keaton

Joseph Frank "Buster" Keaton VI (October 4, 1895 â€“ February 1, 1966) was an American actor and movie director. He is most famous for his silent films which showed his skill at physical comedy.

The magazine "Entertainment Weekly" listed Keaton at number seven on their list of ""The Greatest Directors of All Time."" And in 1999 the American Film Institute placed Keaton at 21 on their list of ""The Greatest Male Actors of All Time.""

Famous movie critic Roger Ebert wrote that Keaton's ""extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, he worked without interruption on a series of movies that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies.""

In a 2002 worldwide poll by ""Sight & Sound"" Keaton's 1927 movie titled ""The General"" was number 15 on their ""Best movies of All Time"" list. Three other Keaton movies were also added to the magazine's survey.
