Satyendra Nath Bose

Professor Satyendra Nath Bose (1 January 1894 – 4 February 1974) was an Indian mathematician and physicist. He is noted for work with Albert Einstein in developing a theory about the gas-like properties of electromagnetic radiation, among other things. He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, which laid down the basics for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. The boson, a kind of particle of matter, is named in his honor. He was a member of the Royal Society and was awarded India's second highest civilian award called the Padma Vibhushan in 1954.

Bose’s works contributed to many concepts such as statistical mechanics, the electromagnetic properties of the ionosphere, the theories of X-ray crystallography and thermoluminescence, and unified field theory. His work also led Einstein to seek him out to work alongside him.

Bose was interested in many subjects including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature and music. He worked on many research and development projects for India.
he was also interested in classical music .
