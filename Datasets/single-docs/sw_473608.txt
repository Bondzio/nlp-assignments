Shapeshifting

Shapeshifting is the act of being able to change into another being or form. The idea of shapeshifting has been around since the Middle Ages. It has been used in literature and epic poems, including works such as "Peleus and Thetis" and the "Iliad". The trend of shapeshifting is still being done today. It is a theme in children's literature, and works of popular culture.
