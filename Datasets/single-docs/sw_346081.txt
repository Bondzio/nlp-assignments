Ovenbird

The Ovenbird ("Seiurus aurocapilla") is a small songbird of the order Passeriformes. Its family is Parulidae. The ovenbird was named after its domed nest with a side entrance, which looks like an oven. This migratory bird is found in eastern North America and winters in Central America, many Caribbean Islands, Florida, and northern Venezuela. The ovenbird walks, unlike most other members of its family, which hop.
