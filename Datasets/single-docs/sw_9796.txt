Tiger

The tiger ("Panthera tigris") is the largest living member of the cat family, the Felidae. It feeds by hunting. It lives in Asia, mainly India (the national animal there is the Bengal tiger), Bhutan, China and Siberia.

Bengal tigers live in the watery jungle called the Sundarbans that is in Bangladesh and West Bengal of India. They are also found in other south-east Asian countries. They have orange fur with black stripes, and a white belly. The black stripes usually extend to the white underside. The stripes are used to keep them camouflaged while hunting. No two tigers have the same pattern of stripes.

Sometimes there are tigers with different colors. There are white tigers that have white fur with black stripes, or that even have pure white fur. They have blue or green eyes. Most Bengal tigers have orange fur. The white coat only appears once in every 10,000 births. The Bengal tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India.

Tigers vary in size depending on their subspecies. Siberian tigers are the largest. Males can grow to at least long (body length) and weigh about . Females are a bit smaller. Record weight for males is claimed as 700 lbs (318 kg), but this cannot be confirmed.

The tiger has 6 living subspecies, and 3 recently extinct (â€ ) subspecies.


Tigers are becoming very rare, because people hunt them for their skin and destroy the habitats they live in. The Bengal tiger has the largest population with 3,500 left in the wild. The South-Chinese tiger is already extinct!

Tigers eat lots of different types of prey, mostly other large mammals. Some examples are deer, monkeys, wild pigs, tapirs, buffalo and other animals found in Asia. All tigers are carnivores (meat eaters). Some tigers may eat up to of meat a day. Tigers kill their prey by clamping down on the prey's throat and suffocating it.
