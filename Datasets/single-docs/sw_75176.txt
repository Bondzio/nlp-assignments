Acropolis

The word acropolis (Greek "acron," edge + "polis," city) means the edge of a town or a high city.
The term acropolis is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many Mayan cities, including Tikal and Cop√°n.

The Acropolis of Athens, for instance, houses the Pathenon, which has a statue of the goddess Athena in it.
