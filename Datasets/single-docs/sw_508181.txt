Jim Webb presidential campaign, 2016

The 2016 presidential campaign of Jim Webb was officially launched when Webb, United States Senator from Virginia and former Secretary of the Navy, announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in 2016 on July 2, 2015. The headquarters of the campaign is in Burke, Virginia.

On November 19, 2014, Webb announced the formation of an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. He reaffirmed his moderate stances as a strength to a potential candidacy, including some criticisms of the Affordable Care Act despite having voted for it, and emphasized his belief that the Democratic Party had been neglecting the "white, working-class" vote in favor of pandering to minorities.

Webb formally announced his candidacy on July 2, 2015 via his campaign website. He suspended his campaign and withdrew from the election on October 20, 2015.
