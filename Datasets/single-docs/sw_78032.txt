Phoenicia

Phoenicia was a civilization to the north of Canaan. Phoenicia existed from 1200 BCE to 900BCE. People from Phoenicia had their own language called the Phoenician language, which is important to very many modern languages. Phoenicians set up many colonies in the Mediterranean region and beyond. Carthage was one of them. Phoenician traders went as far as the British Isles to buy tin. The Phoenicians were a major power in the Mediterranean as early as the 9th century BC.
