Virginia Cooperative Extension

Virginia Cooperative Extension provides resources and educational outreach to more than seven million Virginia residents in the areas of agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, community viability, and 4-H youth development. The federal government started cooperative extension programs in each state with the Smith-Lever Act of 1914. Virginiaâ€™s two land-grant universities: Virginia Tech and Virginia State University run the program. The program has faculty and staff at the two universities, 107 county and city offices, 11 agricultural research and Extension centers, and six 4-H educational centers.
