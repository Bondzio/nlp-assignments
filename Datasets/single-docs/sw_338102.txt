List of rivers of Nicaragua

Most of the rivers in Nicaragua are on the Caribbean coast and empty out into the Caribbean Sea. The RÃ­o San Juan is one of the most important rivers in Nicaragua. It borders Costa Rica and connects the Caribbean Sea to Lake Cocibolca which flows out to the Pacific Ocean. 

This list is arranged by where the river drains. Tributaries are indented under each larger stream's name.
