Intoxication

Intoxication is the state of being affected by one or more psychoactive drugs. It can also refer to the effects caused by the ingestion of poison or by the overconsumption of normally harmless substances.

People who drink too much alcohol become "intoxicated" in some or all of their senses like touch or even eyesight. The senses that impair a person might make the person do or say things they would never normally do or say. The level of harm done usually depends on the substance. If it is mild the person usually is not harmed or impaired. Mild stimulants like caffeine usually do not harm the person.

Often taking a mild depressant or stimulant does not have much effect on the person who took it. But more serious drugs, substances, or even medications can have a large effect on the person. Usually stimulants keep the person awake and energetic. Depressants work the opposite way; they decrease the heart rate of the person and relax them. Sedatives give the same effect. More of these substances can carry harm or even life-threatening effects, if ingested in large amounts.
