7 Up

7 Up is a product of a lemon-lime flavored caffeinate-free soft drink. The rights to the brand are held by Dr Pepper Snapple Group in the United States, and PepsiCo (or its licensees) in the rest of the world, including Puerto Rico. The origin of the name is unclear. It has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1929.
