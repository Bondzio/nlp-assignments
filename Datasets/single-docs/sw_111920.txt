Bill Durnan

William Ronald Durnan (January 22, 1916 â€“ October 31, 1972) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 7 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played his entire NHL career with the Montreal Canadiens. Until Roberto Luongo was named captain of the Vancouver Canucks on September 30, 2008, Durnan was the last goaltender to be a captain in the National Hockey League, and one of only seven ever. Bill Durnan was ambidextrous, meaning he could catch with either hand. This star goalie is one of the greatest Montreal Canadiens in history. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Canadiens and was a six-time Vezina Trophy winner. Durnan was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964.
