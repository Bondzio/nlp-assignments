Bernadette Soubirous

Bernadette Soubirous (January 7 1844 - 1879) was a young girl that had religious visions at Lourdes, France. During 1858 she said she saw the Virgin Mary 18 times. The Roman Catholic Church later made her a saint, and Lourdes has become one of the most visited places for pilgrims.
