Its members were three brothers, Barry Gibb (born 1 September 1946), and twins Maurice Gibb (22 December 1949 – 12 January 2003) and Robin Gibb (22 December 1949 - 20 May 2012). They performed together for almost 40 years. They are most famous for their album, "Saturday Night Fever", the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. They stopped performing after Maurice died. The two other brothers reunited as a duo in 2009. In 2012 Robin died. They had a younger brother, Andy Gibb (1958–1988), who was also a singer.

The brothers were born in Isle of Man, then in the late 1950s moved to Australia, where they began their musical career. In January 1967, they returned to the United Kingdom where they started to become famous. In 1975, the brothers moved to Florida, USA, to live and record.
