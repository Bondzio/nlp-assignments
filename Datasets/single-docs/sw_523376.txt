Calendula officinalis

Calendula officinalis (pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold, garden marigold), is a plant in the genus "Calendula" of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to India. It was the state flower of Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar State, now part of Gujarat.

Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add colour to salads or added to dishes as a garnish instead of saffron. 
The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have been used as a herb and in salads. 

The flowers were used in Ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb and a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin.
