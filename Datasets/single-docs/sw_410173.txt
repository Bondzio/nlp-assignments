It then goes into the Pyrénées-Orientales by the gorges of Galamus and flows into the Mediterranean Sea south of Barcarès.

There is a dam on the Agly river, on Caramany, Pyrénées-Orientales; it was built to prevent floods and to store water.
The Agly is a very irregular small river. Its flow was observed over a period of 42 years (1967-2008) in Estagel about twenty kilometers from its mouth and after receiving the waters of its tributary Verdouble.
