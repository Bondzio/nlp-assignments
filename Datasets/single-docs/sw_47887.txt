1932 Summer Olympics

The 1932 Summer Olympics, officially known as Games of the X Olympiad, were held in Los Angeles, United States. 

U.S. President Herbert Hoover did not attend the games. Despite this snub, the games were thought to be a success because the LA Olympics did not end up in debt.

Los Angeles was the first to provide an athletes' "village".

A total of 37 nations sent athletes to compete at the Los Angeles games.
