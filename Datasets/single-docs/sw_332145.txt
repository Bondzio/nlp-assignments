Otoya Yamaguchi

Yamaguchi was an assassin because he killed a politically active man. His reasons for the murder were political.
Yamaguchi was a member of a radical group. In 1960, he killed Inejiro Asanuma when he was at a public meeting. Soon after, Yamaguchi killed himself in a juvenile center. He wrote on the wall of the room in which he hung himself. His last words were written using a paste made from tooth powder and water. He wrote "Seven lives for my country ..." which was a reference to the last words of 14th century samurai Kusunoki Masashige.

Yasushi Nagao captured the assassination in a dramatic photograph. The Japanese photographer was the first non-American to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize. The image won the 1960 World Press Photo award.

Nobel Prize-winning writer Kenzaburō Ōe based his book "Seventeen" on Yamaguchi.
