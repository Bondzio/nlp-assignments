The Nordic model (or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy) is the economic and social policies common to the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands and Sweden). 

This includes a combination of free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and collective bargaining at the national level.
