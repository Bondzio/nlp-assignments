Ecuadorian general election, 2017

2017 general elections were held in Ecuador on 19 February 2017 alongside a referendum on tax havens. 

Voters elected a new President and National Assembly. 

Incumbent President Rafael Correa of the PAIS Alliance was not eligible for re-election, having served two terms. In the first round of the presidential elections, PAIS Alliance candidate Len√≠n Moreno received 39% of the vote. Although he was more than 10% ahead of his nearest rival, Guillermo Lasso of the Creating Opportunities party, Moreno was just short of the 40% threshold required to avoid a run-off. 

As a result a second round was held on 2 April. In the second round Moreno was elected President with 51.16% of the vote.
