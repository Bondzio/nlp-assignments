Sesame Street

Sesame Street is an Ameircan children's television series with human actors and Jim Henson's Muppets. The show deals with issues such as music, song, alphabet, numbers, and teaching children basics in learning. 
Part of the profits, go to an international project for children's schools.

The show has been on TV since November 10, 1969, becoming one of the most successful children's television programs in America. Jim Henson made the Muppets, and a lot of writers and puppeteers worked together to make the show. The Muppets were used afterwards in a different show called "The Muppet Show". "Sesame Street" has been on TV in 120 countries all over the world. More than 4000 episodes have been made over 40 seasons.

In 2015, new episodes started airing on the HBO channel. After five seasons on HBO, the show returns to PBS as its first-run program.


There are three new muppets for "Sesame Street". One is a girl fairy named Abby Cadabby. Another is Murray, and his lamb named Ovajita. Not only Muppets play in the show but also human actors who live with the Muppets.
