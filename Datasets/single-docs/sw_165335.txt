Sidecarcross

Sidecar-Cross racing, also known as Sidecar Motocross, is a race that uses a different motorcycle chassis than regular motocross. It also uses a team of two people riding together, a "driver" and a "passenger".

Sidecarcross is done on the same race track as normal motocross, but the driver has to ride differently then when riding solo. The driver cannot lean over in the turns. To make sure the sidecar does not flip over, the passenger leans out of the sidecar when they are in the corners. The passenger does much more work than the driver because he moves his whole body around all the time. 
One of the most important things in sidecar racing is teamwork; the best teams race together for many years.
