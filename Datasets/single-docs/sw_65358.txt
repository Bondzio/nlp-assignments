Diana, Princess of Wales

Diana, Princess of Wales (Diana Frances; n√©e Spencer; 1 July 1961 - 31st August 1997) was the first wife of Charles, Prince of Wales. She was one of the most famous women in the world.

Diana was born on 1 July 1961 as Diana Frances Spencer. Her father was Earl Spencer. She left school when she was 16 and moved to London when she was 18.

In 1981, Diana married Prince Charles at St. Paul's Cathedral. They had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. 

Charles and Diana separated in 1992, and divorced in 1996. Diana said Camilla Parker-Bowles was responsible for the problems with her marriage. Diana was the first commoner to marry an heir to the British throne in 300 years. Charles' brothers also married commoners: Andrew, Duke of York, married Sarah Ferguson in 1986, and his youngest brother, Edward, Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. 

Diana's great-grandmother was an American heiress.

Princess Diana was well known for her charity work. She campaigned to end land mines. She also helped to make the lives of people with AIDS better.

Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Al-Fayed, died in a car crash in Paris, in the early morning of 31 August 1997. Many people left flowers, candles, cards and personal messages for her in public places. She had a big funeral in London on the 6th September. 

Concerts for Diana took place shortly after her death. The concerts involved Elton John and numerous others. Elton John released a remake of his song, "Candle in the Wind" in memory of Diana.


Diana's full title, once divorced, was "Lady Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester, Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, Countess of Carrick, Baroness of Renfrew, Lady of the Isles, Princess of Scotland". Legally, she was still entitled to use her previous royal courtesy titles as long as she remained unmarried.
