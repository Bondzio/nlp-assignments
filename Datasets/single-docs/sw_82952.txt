Goldbach's conjecture

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics. It states:

On 7 June 1742, the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler in which he suggested the following conjecture, which would later be called Goldbach's strong conjecture:
He considered 1 to be a prime number, a convention subsequently abandoned. A weaker version of Goldbach's original conjecture is:
This is called Goldbach's weak conjecture. Euler, becoming interested in the problem, wrote back to Goldbach saying that the weak conjecture would be implied by Goldbach's strong conjecture, saying that he was certain that the theorem was true (""ein ganz gewisses Theorema""), but he was not unable to prove it. 

Goldbach's weak conjecture was later proved by Harald Helfgott in 2013, but Goldbach's strong conjecture has not been proved yet.
