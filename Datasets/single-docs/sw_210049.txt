Richard Arkwright

Sir Richard Arkwright (3 January 1733 – 3 August 1792) was an Englishman who invented the spinning frame – later renamed the water frame following the transition to water power. A self-made man, he was a leading entrepreneur of the Industrial Revolution in England. Arkwright's achievement was to combine power, machinery, semi-skilled labour, and a new raw material (cotton) to create, more than a century before Henry Ford, mass production. His mechanical abilities and, above all, his genius for organisation made him more than anyone else, the creator of the modern factory system.

Arkwright was born in Preston, Lancashire, England and died in Cromford, Derbyshire at the age of 59.
