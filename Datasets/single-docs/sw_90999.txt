Grand'Anse Department

Grand'Anse, or "Grande Anse", is one of the ten departments (French: "départments", singular "départment") of Haiti. Its capital is Jérémie.

The "Départment de la Grand'Anse" has an area of 2,091 km². It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Gonâve, to the east by the Nippes Department, to the south by the Sud Department, and by the Caribbean Sea to the west.

The "Massiff de la Hotte", an important Haitian mountain range, runs from west to east along the south of the department, with the Plymouth, Macaya and Casetaches mountain ranges. Because of this, rivers here are short; some of them are Baradères, Dame-Marie, de la Grande-Anse, de Nippes, des Roseaux and Voldrogue.

The department is divided into three "arrondissements" (like districts) and 11 "communes" (like municipalities). The "arrondissements" and their "communes" are:
