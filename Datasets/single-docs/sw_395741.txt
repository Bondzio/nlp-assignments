It was at Valley Forge that General George Washington quartered the American Continental Army during the bitterly cold winter of 1777â€“1778. Many soldiers suffered or died of cold, sickness, and starvation. Valley Forge was not a battlefield. Washington wrote on February 16, 1778, "Naked and starving as they are we cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery."
