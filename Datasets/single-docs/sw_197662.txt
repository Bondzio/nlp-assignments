Star cluster

A star cluster is a group of stars. They are held together by the gravitational attraction of the stars, which are all related through common origin. 

There are two major types of clusters: 

Super star clusters of very young large stars are known. They are thought to be precursors of globular clusters. The short-lived huge blue stars emit lots of UV radiation which ionises the surrounding gas. Examples are Westerlund 1 and 2 in the Milky Way, and R136 in the Larger Magellanic Cloud.
