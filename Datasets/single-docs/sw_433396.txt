Death by natural causes

Death by natural causes is often recorded on death records as the cause of a person's death. Death from natural causes might be a heart attack, stroke, old age, illness or infection. Cancer is not considered a natural cause of death. Also, a cause of death can be recorded as "undetermined" if the person kills themself.
