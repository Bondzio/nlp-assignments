Australian cinema

Cinema of Australia means the system of production, distribution, and showing of movies in Australia. Making movies in Australia started in 1906. "The Story of the Kelly Gang" was the earliest feature movie ever made. Since then, many movies have been made in Australia. Many have got international praise. Many actors and moviemakers started their careers in Australian movies. 

Commercially successful Australian movies have included Paul Hogan's "Crocodile Dundee", Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge!" and Chris Noonan's "Babe". Other award winning productions include "Picnic at Hanging Rock", "Gallipoli", "The Tracker", "Shine" and "Ten Canoes". Famous Australian trained actors include Errol Flynn, Peter Finch, Rod Taylor, Mel Gibson, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.

The Australian movie history has been called 'boom and bust'. This is because at times there are very few movies made and other times many movies are made.
