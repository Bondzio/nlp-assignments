Corfe Castle

Corfe Castle is a small village and ruined castle dating back to the 11th century. It is in a gap in the Purbeck Hills, five miles south of Wareham, in Dorset, England. 

The oldest surviving structure on the castle site dates to the 11th century, although there are good reasons to suppose that there was a stronghold there before the Norman Conquest. Edward the Martyr was killed at the site on March 18, 978.
