In 2004, "Time" magazine in their third annual special on Asia's heroes selected him along with 19 other Asians as the "20 Asian Heroes under the age of 40".

In 2005 he appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of "National Geographic" magazine dated February 2005. This was a rare honour extended by National Geographic since unlike many other magazines celebrities are not their natural choice for a cover image.
