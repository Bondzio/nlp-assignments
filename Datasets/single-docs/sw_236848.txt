Emperor Seinei

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

According to "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki", Seinei was a son of Emperor Yūryaku. 

Seinei fathered no children. He adopted two grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each would attain the throne; and they would become known as Emperor Ninken and as Emperor Kenzo

Very little is known about the events of Seinei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

After the death of his father, Seinei overcame others in the struggle for power. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Seinei. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
