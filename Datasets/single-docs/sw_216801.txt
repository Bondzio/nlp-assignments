Seattle Sounders FC

Seattle Sounders FC is a team in Major League Soccer (MLS) that plays in Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 2007 and began playing in 2009. Their name, which comes from the name of two older teams in Seattle, was chosen by fans in 2008. Four people own the team, including producer Joe Roth, Adrian Hanauer, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and comedian Drew Carey. The team plays at CenturyLink Field, which it shares with the Seattle Seahawks. Many fans are in groups and also a 53-member band called Sound Wave plays at every home game. Arlo White, who used to work for the BBC, is the announcer for local games. Their rivals, the San Jose Earthquakes, play against the Seattle Sounders FC in the Heritage Cup every year.

The team was the 15th MLS team and first played in the 2009 season. At every Seattle game, all of the seats were sold and the fans set a new record for average (or middle) match attendance, while the team also sold more season tickets than anyone else in the MLS. The Seattle Sounders FC finished their first year in the MLS playoffs, but lost in the semi-finals. The team did win their first trophy, the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, and became the second team to do so in their first year. The Sounders went on to win the U.S. Open Cup in 2010 and 2011 as well, becoming the first team in over 40 years to win that competition three straight times.
