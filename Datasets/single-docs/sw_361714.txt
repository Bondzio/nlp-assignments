2012 U.S. diplomatic missions attacks

On September 11, 2012, the U.S. embassies in Cairo, Egypt; Chennai, India; Tunis, Tunisia; Khartoum, Sudan; Sana'a, Yemen, and the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya were attacked.

On September 11, 2012, the attack was caused by protests over media excerpts from a trailer of a movie, "Innocence of Muslims", which the protestors considered blasphemy against the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. In Egypt, a group scaled the embassy wall and tore down the American flag, replacing it with a black Islamist flag. In Libya, rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the consulate from a nearby farm. The attack killed the visiting U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, Glen Doherty a security officer, Sean Smith a United States Foreign Service Information Management Officer, and Tyrone S. Woods a former U.S. Navy Seal, ten Libyan police officers, and two others. The protest ended on September 27, 2012.

About 75 people died during the attack. The most notable deaths were the ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
