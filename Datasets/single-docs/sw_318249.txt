Double acute accent

The double acute accent ( Àù ) is a special mark called a diacritic. It is usually used to make a vowel sound longer. It is only used in the Latin alphabet. The double acute accent is mainly used in Hungarian. Because of this, it is sometimes called the hungarumlaut. This is a way of writing "Hungarian umlaut".
