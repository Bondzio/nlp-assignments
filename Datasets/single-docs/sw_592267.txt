Jim Vance

James Howard "Jim" Vance III (January 10, 1942 – July 22, 2017) was an American television news anchor in Washington, D.C.. 

In 1972, Vance became WRC-TV's main co-anchor, as one of the first African Americans to serve in this position at any American television station. Between 1972 and 1976, Vance worked as co-anchor with Glenn Rinker at WRC-TV. Between 1976 and 1980, Vance co-anchored with Sue Simmons, a pairing that resulted in one of the first, if not the first, African-American co-anchors of a major market newscast.

Vance died on July 22, 2017 in Washington, D.C. following a short battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 75. At the time of his death, Vance was the region's longest-serving television news anchor with more than 45 years at WRC-TV.
