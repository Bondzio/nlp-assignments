HaReshima HaMeshutefet / al-Qa'imah al-Mushtarakah was founded in 2015 as a cooperation of Hadash (communist), Balad (social democratic, secular), Ra'am (Islamist), and Ta'al (right-wing centrist, secular). Especially the last three parties are fully Arab and Anti-Zionist.

The Joint List was established to prevent the Arab parties from disappearing from the Knesset due to the raise of the election threshold, and also to back the Zionist Union in its effort to replace the Third Netanyahu Government.

Number of seats in the 20th Knesset: 13 (Hadash: 5, Balad: 3, Ra'am: 3, and Ta'al: 2).
