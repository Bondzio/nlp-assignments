Isaac Hayes

Isaac Hayes (August 20, 1942 â€“ August 10, 2008) was an American soul singer, songwriter, and actor. He was also known for playing Chef in "South Park", but he left this role because he did not like it when "South Park" made fun of Scientology, which was his religion. He won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for the theme from "Shaft", a 1971 movie.

Hayes was found on the floor of his house on August 10, 2008. He was taken to the hospital. He died there, of a stroke.
