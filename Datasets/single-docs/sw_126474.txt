Chicago Spire

The Chicago Spire is a very large skyscraper that was being built in Chicago, Illinois. Because of financial problems, the project has not been finished.

As of May 2013, however, interest in the Chicago Spire site has risen, drawing in at least a half-dozen offers for the property. The developer is also considering a bid to take back control of the property, reigniting hope that the 2,000Â ft. skyscraper may actually be built.
