Bacillus (shape)

A bacillus (plural bacilli) is a rod-shaped cylindrical bacteria. Bacilli are found in many different taxonomic groups of bacteria.



There is no connection between the shape of a bacterium and its colors in the gram staining. In other words, some of them are gram negative and some are gram positive.
