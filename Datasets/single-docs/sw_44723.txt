Consultation (Bahá'í practice)

Consultation is a special way of discussing problems and making decisions used by Bahá'ís. 

The word consult generally means to talk about something, consider all the facts, and make a decision. To Bahá'ís, consultation also means:

Consultation is used by Bahá'í elected leaders when they gather in councils to make sure no one person gets to decide everything. Married people consult with their husband or wife to solve difficulties in the marriage. Parents and children may consult, teachers and students may consult, and Bahá'ís all consult as a community when they get together every nineteen days.
