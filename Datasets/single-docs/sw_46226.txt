Samuel Alito

Samuel Anthony Alito, Jr. (; born April 1, 1950) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He was nominated by President George W. Bush and has served on the court since January 31, 2006.

Alito was born to Italian American parents. He served in the U.S. Army reserves years before joining the Supreme Court. Alito often favors a Republican view of the law. The vote by the U.S. Senate to make Alito a judge was one of the closest in U.S. History, because many Democrats did not want five Republicans on the court. Alito is from Trenton, New Jersey.
