Tensile strength

Tensile strength is a measurement of the force required to pull something such as rope, wire, or a structural beam to the point where it breaks. 

The tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can take before failure, for example breaking.

There are three typical definitions of tensile strength:




Some typical tensile strengths of some materials:
