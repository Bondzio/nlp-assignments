Inauguration of Donald Trump

The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States was held on Friday, January 20, 2017, on the West Front of the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.

The inauguration marked the beginning of the four-year term of Donald Trump as President and of Mike Pence as Vice President. The presidential oath of office was administered to Trump by Chief Justice John Roberts and the vice presidential oath of office was administered to Pence by Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.

Benedictions were given by several clerics (among them a rabbi and reverend Franklin Graham, son of the retired reverend Billy Graham, who for decades gave benedictions at the inauguration of US presidents).

Main theme in the auguration speech of President Trump was his focus on the interests of the United States ("America first!", "Make America Great Again").

The number of spectators was less than at the inaugurations of his predecessor Barack Obama, although this was contested by President Trump and his spokesman. Most voters in Washington D.C. had voted for Hillary Clinton, Trump's main opponent in the United States presidential election, 2016.

Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, along with their respective wives, the First Ladies (including Hillary Clinton), had all confirmed their attendance at Trump's inauguration, and were all present. George H. W. Bush, age 92, did not attend the inauguration due to health reasons.

As of mid-December, there were 20 requests for demonstration permits for Donald J. Trump's inauguration, including Bikers for Trump, and the Women's March on Washington, scheduled for the day after inauguration day.
