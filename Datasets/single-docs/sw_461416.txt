Flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic

The flag of the Azerbaijan SSR was first adopted in 1920, and was a red flag with a yellow crescent and star in the left upper corner.

From the second part of 1921 to 1922, Azerbaijan SSR used a red flag with the yellow Cyrillic letters "АССР" (ASSR).

In 1937, golden hammer and sickle were added in the top left hand corner, with beneath the Latin letters "AzSSR" in a serif font in place of the Cyrillic letters. A third version was issued in 1940s, and had "AzSSR" replaced by its Cyrillic version "АзССР". The last version of the flag was adopted by the Azerbaijan SSR on October 7, 1952. It was the flag of the Soviet Union, with an horizontal blue band on the bottom fourth.
