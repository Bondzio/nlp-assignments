Nice &amp; Slow

"Nice & Slow" is a song by American singer Usher. It was released as the second single from his second album "My Way" (1997). It became his first number one single on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. It also reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. Because of this, "Nice & Slow" was not a success in that country since his single "You Make Me Wanna..." reached number one. 

It also became the last single from Usher's "My Way" album. It was written by Brian & Brandon Casey of Jagged Edge, Manuel Seal, Jermaine Dupri, and Usher. The music video for the song featured Kimora Lee Simmons.
