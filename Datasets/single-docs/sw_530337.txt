Department for Social Security

The Department of Social Security (DSS) was a government department in the United Kingdom. The old abbreviation is still often used informally. 

The department was created in 1988. The Department of Health and Social Security was divided into two departments, one of which was the DSS. During 2001, the department was largely replaced by the Department for Work and Pensions. The other responsibilities of the department were assumed by the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence.
