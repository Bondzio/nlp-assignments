Angel Road railway station

Angel Road railway station is in the London Borough of Enfield at Edmonton in north east London. It is in Travelcard Zone 4, on the Tottenham Hale branch of the Lea Valley Lines. The station, and all trains serving it, is operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. It is partially located beneath the A406 road (which is named "Angel Road" at that point). Due to reconstruction of the A406 in the mid-1990s (involving grade-separation), the station no longer has an entrance on "Angel Road", with the only access via a footpath running south from "Conduit Lane" to the north. The station is unstaffed.
