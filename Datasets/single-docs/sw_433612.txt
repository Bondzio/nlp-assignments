Sammy Lee (diver)

Dr. Samuel "Sammy" Lee (August 1, 1920 â€“ December 2, 2016) was an Korean-American diver. He was the first Asian-American to win an Olympic gold medal for the United States in 1948. 

Lee was born in Fresno, California. He was raised in San Francisco, California. Lee studied at the Occidental College in Los Angeles and studied briefly at the University of Southern California.

He was also the first man to win gold medals "back-to-back" in Olympic platform diving. This means he won a second gold medal for the same event in the next Olympics, in 1952.

Lee, who suffered from dementia and heart disease, died of complications from pneumonia on December 2, 2016 at his home in Newport Beach, California, aged 96.
