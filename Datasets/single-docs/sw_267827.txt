Anoxic event

Anoxic events (AE) occur when oceans become completely depleted of oxygen (O) below the surface levels. They may be called Oceanic anoxic events: or Deep ocean anoxic events.

Major anoxic events have happened, though not for millions of years. The geological record of organic-rich sediment (black shales) shows that they happened in the past. However, only "in rare, extreme cases, [did] euxinia lead to biotic crises. [The] hypothesis [is] best supported by evidence from the end-Permian mass extinction".

Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions. These mass extinctions were so characteristic that they have been used by geologists as markers in biostratigraphic dating. Typically, oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years, before a full recovery.

There are several places on earth today that show the features of anoxic events on a localized level. 'Dead zones' exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay, in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat, the Black Sea, in the northern Adriatic and off the coast of Louisiana.

It is not known for certain what the causes were of AEs. A possible course of events is:

This is not yet well-established science. It is a speculation by scientists interested in palaeoecology and climate change. However, the fact is that these anoxic events did occur, and did have causes which might be in operation today.
