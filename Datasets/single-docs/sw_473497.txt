John Graham "Mac" McVie (born 26 November 1945) is a British bass guitarist. He is best known as a member of rock groups John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Fleetwood Mac. He joined Fleetwood Mac shortly after its formation by guitarist Peter Green in 1967. He replaced bassist Bob Brunning.

In 1968, he married blues pianist and singer Christine Perfect, who became a member of Fleetwood Mac two years later. John and Christine McVie divorced, however, in 1977.
