James Wisniewski

James Joseph Wisniewski (born February 21, 1984 in Canton, Michigan) is an NHL ice hockey defenceman whose rights belong to the Columbus Blue Jackets. He was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks with the 156th overall pick in the 2002 NHL Draft.

Wisniewski also played for the Chicago Blackhawks for 4 seasons, the Anaheim Ducks for 2 seasons, the New York Islanders for 1 season and the Montreal Canadiens for 1 season before his rights were traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2012 for the Canadiens. The draft pick will become a fifth-rounder if Columbus actually signs Wisniewski.
