New Wave of British Heavy Metal

The New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) was a heavy metal movement that started in the late 1970s, in Britain. It was well known around the world by the early 1980s. The movement developed as a reaction in part to the decline of early heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath

Some NWOBHM bands are Saxon, Mot√∂rhead, Diamond Head, and Iron Maiden
