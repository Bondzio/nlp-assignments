Prunus virginiana

Chokecherries ("Prunus virginiana") are shrubs or small trees, which grow to around 4.9 m (16 ft 1 in). 

Their leaves are oval with coarse, sharp edges. The flowers grow about 38.1–76.2 cm (15–30 in) long in late spring (well after chokecherry leaves appear). 

The fruits are about 1 cm (3⁄8 in) across. They range in color from bright red to black. They have a very astringent taste, both somewhat sour and somewhat bitter. The fruits are sweetest when they are very ripe "berries" (actually drupes). These are dark in color.
