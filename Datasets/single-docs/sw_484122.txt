Five Nights at Freddy's 3

Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is a 2015 indie point-and-click survival horror video game developed by Scott Cawthon. It is the third entry in the "Five Nights at Freddy's" series. The game was released on Steam on March 2, 2015, then for Android devices on March 7, 2015. The game is set 30 years after "Five Nights at Freddy's".

The player assumes the role of a newly hired employee at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed amusement park attraction. In addition, the player must monitor the status of three operating systems - cameras, audio, and ventilation - and reboot them whenever they begin to malfunction. They have to defend from Springtrap and the 'phantoms', which are ghost animatronics that can't hurt you.
