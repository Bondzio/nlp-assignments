New York Americans

The New York Americans were a professional ice hockey team, the third expansion team in the history of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the second to play in the United States. The team was part of the NHL from the 1925-26 season until the end of the 1941-42 season. The team was very popular in its first season. This popularity led to a new team, the New York Rangers, being organized for the 1926-26 season. The increasing success of the New York Rangers in the 1930s resulted in a decrease in popularity for the New York Americans. In 1941 the team name was changed to Brooklyn Americans, the name for a borough of New York City. After the 1941-42 season the team decided to stop competing until the end of World War II. When the war ended the NHL decided to not have the team play again. The New York Americans played their home games at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
