V. C. Andrews

Cleo Virginia Andrews (V. C. Andrews) (June 6, 1923 â€“ December 19, 1986) was an American writer from Portsmouth, Virginia. Her best-selling stories included "My Sweet Audrina" and two series of books about the "Dollanganger" and "Casteel" families. 

Her stories were written in English and translated into French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Greek, Finnish, Hungarian, Swedish, Portuguese and Hebrew.

Her first novel, "Flowers in the Attic," was published in 1979. 

V. C. Andrews died from breast cancer in 1986, leaving behind some unpublished stories. The estate of V. C. Andrews hired a ghostwriter, Andrew Neiderman, to continue the stories, which are still published under the name V. C. Andrews. 




This series and all subsequent novels were written by Neiderman, but are attributed to Andrews.
