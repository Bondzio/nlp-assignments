Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867

The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (, ) established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. It was signed by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and a Hungarian delegation led by "Ferenc De√°k". The compromise followed a series of failed constitutional reforms of the Habsburg Empire. 

The Hungarian nobles wanted and got the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary. This showed Hungary's historic presence. A separate parliament at Budapest was created. It could make laws for the lands of the Hungarian crown.
