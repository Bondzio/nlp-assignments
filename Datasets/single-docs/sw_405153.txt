English Defence League

The English Defence League, or in short EDL, is a street protest group in the United Kingdom which is against Sharia law and Islamism. The group was founded in 2009 in Luton by Tommy Robinson. Groups including Unite Against Fascism (UAF) and Anonymous are against the EDL. EDL can also stand for the "European Defence League", also founded by Tommy Robinson. Tommy Robinson left the EDL in October 2013. Tim Ablitt became the new leader. A report found that 81% of EDL supporters are male.
