Flag of Lithuania

The Flag of Lithuania that is used today was adopted by the Council of Lithuania in 1918 and re-adopted in 1989. Some ratio changes were made in 2004. Today the flag consists of three equal oblongs, each coloured yellow, green and red (top to bottom). The flag's ratio is 3:5 (1:2 in 1989). It is used as a national flag and civil ensign.
