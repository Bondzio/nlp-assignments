Toledo District

Toledo District is the southernmost district in Belize. Punta Gorda is the district capital. It is the least developed region in the country. It has some of the most clean rainforests, many caves, coastal lowland plains, and offshore cays. Toledo is home to a wide range of cultures—from Mopan and Kekchi Maya, to Creole, the Garifuna, East Indians, Mennonites, Mestizos, and descendants of US Confederate settlers.

According to the 2010 census, Toledo District had a population of 30,538 people.

The economy of Toledo relies heavily on agriculture. Crops grown include beans and corn, as well as rice. Cacao is grown for the renowned Maya Gold chocolate. The District’s ancient and modern-day links with chocolate are celebrated each year in May.
