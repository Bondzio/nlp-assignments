Doner kebab

The doner kebab (or donner kebab, but seldom "d√∂ner") kebab with salad and sauce is a very popular food.

Kebab shops offer hot chili sauce and garlic yoghurt-style sauce. Barbecue sauce, burger sauce, lemon juice, or a mint sauce similar to raita are also popular.

Kebabs are often eaten as take-away food on the way home after a night out. There are several common ways in which doner kebabs are served.


Kebabs are very much part of the Friday and Saturday night culture in the UK rather than breakfast or lunchtime food. UK "doner kebab" often uses a different mixture of spices, because immigrants from Cyprus run many of the shops. They may offer doner, shish (lamb and chicken) and kofte kebabs, with a 'special' including some of each with bread and chips.
