Fur seal

Fur seals are any of nine species of pinnipeds in the "Otariidae" family. One species, the northern fur seal ("Callorhinus ursinus") inhabits the North Pacific, while eight species in the "Arctocephalus" genus are found primarily in the Southern hemisphere.

Therefore they are not a single taxonomic unit.
