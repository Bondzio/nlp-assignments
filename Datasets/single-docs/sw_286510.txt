Chris Candido

Christopher B. "Chris" Candito (March 21, 1972â€“April 28, 2005) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known by his ring name Chris Candido. He was best known for his time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). He was also known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) where he competed under the ring name Skip and was part of the tag team, The Bodydonnas. 

He was married to wrestling valet, Tammy Lynn Sytch who is better known by the name, Sunny.

On April 24, 2005 at Lockdown, Candido suffered a fractured tibia and fibula as well as a dislocated ankle during a steel cage match with Lance Hoyt against Apolo and Sonny Siaki. He would undergo surgery the next day and would have titanium plates and screws inserted into his leg. Candido would be at the following "Impact!" tapings and managed The Naturals when they defeated America's Most Wanted to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. On April 28, 2005, Candido felt ill and his condition had worsened during the day. Candido collapsed during the evening and he was rushed to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. The doctors drained his lungs, but he died shortly afterwards. His brother Johnny said that Candido had died because of a blood clot, a complication from surgery.

On the April 29 episode of "Impact!" as well as at the Hard Justice PPV event, TNA paid tribute to Candido. TNA decided to hold a tournament called the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament in his honor in late 2005. In 2009, Candido was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame.
