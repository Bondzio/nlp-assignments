Division of Solomon

The Division of Solomon is an Australian Electoral Division in the Northern Territory. It covers the cities of Darwin (including the surrounding suburbs) and Palmerston. The only other division in the territory, the Division of Lingiari, covers the remainder of the territory.

The division was created in 2000. It is named for Vaiben Solomon, a Premier of South Australia, and member of the first Australian Parliament. He represented the Northern Territory in the South Australian House of Assembly, when it was still part of that state.
