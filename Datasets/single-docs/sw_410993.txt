IRS tax forms

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues tax forms to people and organisations who pay tax in the United States. These documents are used by taxpayers to report information about their finances. This includes information about income, which is required by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in order to calculate how much tax must be paid to the federal government of the United States. There are over 800 forms. The best-known of these is Form 1040 used by individual people.
