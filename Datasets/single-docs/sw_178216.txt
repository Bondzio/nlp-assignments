Umar

Umar (c. 581-83 CE– 7 November, 644), also known as Umar the Great or Omar the Great was a Muslim from the Banu Adi clan. He was a disciple of the Muslim prophet Muhammad and the second Caliph of Islam. He was great caliph of Islam and his life was inspiration for many Muslims and Mahatma Gandhi said that if India finds a man like Omar ibn Khatab all the problems will be solved. Mahatma Gandhi once said “I can not give you the reference of Ram Chandar or Krishna, because they were not historical figures. I can not help it but to present to you the names of (Hazrat) Abu Bakar (RA) and (Hazrat) Umar Farooq (RA). They were leaders of a vast Empire, yet they lived a life of austerity.”
