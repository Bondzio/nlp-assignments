Inline skating

Inline skating is a form of skating. It involves a person moving across land using shoes that have wheels on the bottom. It is similar to roller skating, except that the wheels are smaller and arranged in a single line. It is also called rollerblading after the brand of skates, "Rollerblade".

Inline skates usually have between 2 to 5 polyurethane wheels. They are arranged in a single line. This allows for faster speeds than roller skates.
