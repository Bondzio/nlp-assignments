Flag of Maine

The Flag of the State of Maine has the state coat of arms on a blue field. In the center of the shield a moose rests under a tall pine tree. A farmer and seaman represent the normal reliance on agriculture and the sea by the state. The "North Star" represents the state motto: Dirigo ("I Lead").
