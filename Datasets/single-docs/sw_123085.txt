Oklahoma City Thunder

The Oklahoma City Thunder is a professional basketball franchise based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The Seattle SuperSonics franchise had moved to Oklahoma, which meant that there was a new team name (Oklahoma City Thunder). Because of this, the Thunder replaced Seattle in the Western Conference's Northwest Division and began play at Oklahoma City's Ford Center (later renamed Chesapeake Energy Arena) during the 2008â€“09 NBA season.
