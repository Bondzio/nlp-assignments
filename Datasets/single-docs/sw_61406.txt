Aqua Teen Hunger Force

Aqua Teen Hunger Force is an American animated comedy television series that is shown on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. The series is about three talking food items and their next door neighbor who live in New Jersey. In each 11 minute episode, the Aqua Teens often become part of some very unusual story that often involves one or more characters who often come on the show. The humor of the show is very unusual and some people do not understand it.



Dave Willis is the only cast member to appear in every episode.Dana Snyder and Carey Means have been absent for one episode.C. Martin Croker is only a main cast member on the show's first two seasons. His only other appearance was on a season 7 episode.


In 2007 an 85-minute movie was released which is called "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters". The movie is about the characters trying to put an exercise machine together. The movie has special appearances by Neil Peart of the band Rush, Chris Kattan, Fred Armisen, Tina Fey, and Mastadon. The movie also shows the fourth Aqua Teen, a chicken nuggett named Chicken Bittle, voiced by Bruce Campbell. The movie lost money because some light-up advertising devices caused a bomb scare in Boston.
