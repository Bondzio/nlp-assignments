Emperor Keikō

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

Keikō is almost certainly a legend; but the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" record his name.

The limited information about Keikō does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

In "Kojiki", Keikō sent his one of his sons to Kyūshū to fight battles on his behalf. In "Nihonshoki", Keikō fought and won these battles against local tribes. According to both sources, he sent Yamatotakeru to Izumo province and eastern provinces to expand his territory.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Keikō.

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara. The "kami" of Emperor Keikō is also venerated at Anaho jinja in Anaho, Ōmi province.
