Izumo Province

The province had borders with Iwami, Bingo and H≈çki provinces.

In the 8th century, Matsue became the provincial capital city.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Izumo Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Izumo taisha" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Izumo.
