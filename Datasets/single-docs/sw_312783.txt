Pope Pius IV

Pope Pius IV (; 31 March 1499 â€“ 9 December 1565), born Giovanni Angelo Medici, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 225th Pope from 1559 to 1565.

Giovanni Angelo Medici was born in Milan. He was not closely related to the Medicis of Florence. 

He studied at University of Pavia and the University of Bologna where he earned a law degree.

In 1527, Medici went to Rome where he joined the church bureaucracy.

In 1549, Pope Paul III made Medici a cardinal. Pope Leo III sent him on diplomatic missions to Germany and to Hungary.

During the reign of Pope Paul IV, Cardinal Medici was out of favor.

Cardinal Medici was elected Pope on 25 December 1559.

In the context of the Counter-Reformation, this pope moderated the Inquisition in Italy.

Pope Paul III presided over the last session of the Council of Trent which was the major event of his papacy.

In part, the Tridentine Creed reflects the thinking of church leaders at the Council of Trent. 

After his death in 1565, the body of Pope Pius IV was entombed at the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli.
