Steering

Steering is the collection of mechanical parts which allow a vessel (ship, boat) or vehicle (truck, car, motorcycle or bicycle) to follow the desired course. Rail transport is an exception because the rail tracks provide the steering function. In vehicle steering, the user turning on the steering wheel directly controls the rate of the turn. Response is immediate. Submarines and ships operate in a fluid, and use control surfaces that work on the fluid. There is a delay between the steering controls and the time it takes for the system to respond.
