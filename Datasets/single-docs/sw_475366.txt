Division of Kingston

The Division of Kingston is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia. It covers south part of the Adelaide metropolitan area. It includes the suburbs of Aldinga Beach, Christie Downs, Christies Beach, Hackham, Hallett Cove, Huntfield Heights, Lonsdale, Maslin Beach, Moana, Morphett Vale, Old Noarlunga, Onkaparinga Hills, Port Noarlunga, Reynella, Seaford, Sellicks Beach, Sheidow Park, Port Willunga, Trott Park, Woodcroft, and parts of Happy Valley and McLaren Flat.

It was set up in 1949 and is named after Charles Kingston, Premier of South Australia (1893–1899). He was elected to the first House of Representatives in 1901 and the first Federal member of the Division of Adelaide in 1903. 

Notably, every sitting member in the electorate's history has been defeated at an election—none have retired or resigned.
