Conflict

A conflict is a struggle between people. The struggle may be physical, or between conflicting ideas. The word comes from Latin "conflingere" Conflingere means "to come together for a battle". Conflicts can either be within one person, or they can involve several people or groups. Conflicts arise because there are needs, values or ideas that are seen to be different, and there is no means to reconcile the dispute. 

Very often, conflicts lead to fights, or even wars (in the case where conflicts are solved with weapons). Conflict between ideas is usually fought with propaganda.
