Super Bowl XLVII

Super Bowl XLVII (or Super Bowl 47) was a Super Bowl game between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL) in the 2012 NFL season. The Ravens won against the 49ers 34â€“31. 

The game was played on February 3, 2013 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The win gave the Ravens their second Super Bowl title and their first since the 2000 NFL season at Super Bowl XXXV. Joe Flacco was named the Super Bowl MVP.

The game was also nicknamed the Harbaugh Bowl, HarBowl and Brother Bowl because it was the first Super Bowl that featured two brothers as opposing head coaches with both Baltimore's John Harbaugh and San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh facing each other.

The game also marked Ray Lewis' last NFL game after he said that he was going to retire from professional football at the end of the 2012 season.
