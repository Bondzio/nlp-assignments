Basic English

Basic English (Business Academic Scientific International Commercial) is a controlled language to explain complex thoughts. It has chosen by Charles Kay Ogden. Some articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use only Basic English.

In 1936 Ogden had Otto and Marie Neurath make "International Picture Language" as one of a group of eight books in Basic English.

The word use of Basic English is simpler and more regular than the word use of the normal English. In normal English, words often have a number of different meanings. To make Basic English easier, not all the meanings of a word are used.

Ogden's rules of grammar for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events simply.
