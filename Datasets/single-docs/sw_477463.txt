Euclidean space

Euclidean space is the space euclidean geometry uses. In essence, it was described in Euclid's Elements. The Euclidean plane and the three dimensional space are part of Euclidean space. Euclidian space is sometimes called Cartesian space. A few other spaces and mathematical objects that are similar were added later. Euclid based his work Elements on certain axioms. Euclidean space can be described using such axioms.
