Trichromacy

Trichromacy is a type of colour vision. Animals with this kind of vision see colours by means of cone cells in their retina. Each of three types of cone cell are sensitive to a different range of light wavelengths. Colour as perceived by us is constructed by our brain's visual cortex. Humans and many other primates have full colour vision. Many other mammals do not, because they have only one or two types of cone cells, which do not collect such a wide range of wavelengths.
