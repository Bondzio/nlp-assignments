Shehbaz Sharif

Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif (/, born 23 September 1951) is a well-known Pakistani politician and currently President of Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N). He is the brother of Nawaz Sharif, former Prime Minister of Pakistan. He is the chief minister of Pakistan's most populous province Punjab since 2008. Previously, he held this position from 1997 to 1999, when Pervez Musharraf took control of Pakistan in a military coup. He, along with his entire family, was forced into exile until his return to Pakistan in late 2007.

On 29 July 2017, Sharif was named as the Prime Minister of Pakistan following the resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after Panama Papers case decision. After Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, it was reported that he's likely to continue as Prime Minister for next ten months until 2018 general election<ref name="indianexpress/3aug2017"></ref> due to reluctance of Shahbaz Sharif to leave the post of the Chief Minister of Punjab.
