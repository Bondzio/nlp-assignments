Carlisle is about 8 miles south-southwest of Lowell, and 23 miles northwest of Boston. 

In the past decades, Carilse has had a problem with drinking water. This is because of a lack of sewage. Water testing in May 2006 said there are Coliform bacteria in four wells in Carlisle. Because of these tests, the Town of Carlisle set up rules for sewage disposal in April 2008. The town said that the rules are necessary because Carlisle has other water supply. When wells are polluted, there is no town water which can be brought in because the town government has no wells of its own.
