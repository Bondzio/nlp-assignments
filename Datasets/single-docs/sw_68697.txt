Amazons

The Amazons (in Greek, ) were a mythical ancient nation of all-women warriors. Herodotus placed them in a region around Scythia in Sarmatia. The histories and legends in Greek mythology may be inspired by warrior women among the Sarmatians.

The Amazons are notably featured as part of the Labours of Hercules, in which the hero defeats them after he steals the magical belt belonging to their queen Hippolyta.

In more modern times, the comic character Wonder Woman is an Amazon.
