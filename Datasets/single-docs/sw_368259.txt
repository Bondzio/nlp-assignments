Kim Peek

Laurence Kim Peek (November 11, 1951 â€“ December 19, 2009) was an American savant. Peek had brain damage since before birth, but was not autistic.

Peek was considered a "mega-savant" because he was a genius on at least 15 different subjects, from history to sport. He was the inspiration for the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie "Rain Man". Peek was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon).

On December 19, 2009 at age 58, Peek died of a heart attack in Murray, Utah.
