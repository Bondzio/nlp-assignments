Jungle cat

The Jungle Cat, ("Felis chaus"), is a successful and widespread wild cat. It ranges from Egypt in the west to China in the east, and it is common in India.

The jungle cat is the largest remaining species of the wild cat genus "Felis". It is 20 to 37 inches in body length (50 to 97 cm), with a 8 to 12 inch tail (20 to 31 cm). 

True to Bergmann's rule, the felid is largest at the northern limits of its range and becomes smaller-bodied closer to the tropics. 

They inhabit savannas, tropical dry forests and reedbeds along rivers and lakes in the lowlands, but, despite the name, are not found in rainforests. Although they are adaptable animals, being found even in dry steppe, they prefer wetland environments with tall grasses or reeds in which to hide.
