Mektig og avmektig: Tore Tønne, media og maktspillet bak kulissene

When writing the book Ivar Hippe talked to over 60 people who knew Tore Tønne.

Critics liked the book, with both "Aftenposten" and "Dagbladet" writing a very positive review about it. Kjell Inge Røkke did not like the book and said that Hippe was a very bad person because he released the book so fast.
