Tom and Jerry

Tom and Jerry is an American animated cartoon series. The original cartoons were created, written and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. It is named after its two main characters: a blue-grey cat named Tom and a brown house mouse named Jerry. Each cartoon shows the two characters getting into comedic fights or chases. They are also shown getting hurt, but always get better.

A total of 114 "Tom and Jerry" cartoons were produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio from 1940–1958, starting with "Puss Gets the Boot". Seven of these cartoons won an Academy Award for Animated Short Film between 1943 and 1953.

Later, Gene Deitch in Europe made 13 more cartoons for the series from 1961-1962. Then, Chuck Jones produced 34 more cartoons from 1963–1967. Finally, Hanna-Barbera worked with Warner Brothers Animation to make the last two "Tom and Jerry" cartoons: "The Mansion Cat" in 2001, and "The Karate Guard" in 2005. Since then, the cartoon characters have made appearances in other media.
