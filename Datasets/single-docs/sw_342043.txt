Hollaback Girl

"Hollaback Girl" is the third single off American singer Gwen Stefani's first solo studio album "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." The song was released in March 15, 2005. 

While writing the song, Stefani and Pharrell Williams discussed about writing a song on her intentions for pursuing a solo career. Stefani then said that the album was missing an "attitude song", and she remembered a negative comment that musician Courtney Love had said about her in an interview with magazine "Seventeen". 

Stefani then responded to Love's comment in the March 2005 issue of the NME:

On the "Billboard" charts, "Hollaback Girl" was able to peak at #1 on Hot 100, #1 on the Pop 100, #8 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, #15 on the Hot Dance Club Play, and #18 on the Adult Pop Songs charts. In 2006, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the categories of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year.
