Archaeological site

An archeological site is a place where archaeologists work. Usually, evidence has been found (or is suppposed to be there) of a previous cultural achievement. The archeologists working there will classify what they find. They may also change the site so that what has been found can be preserved better.

The site will have trenches so that people can excavate better. To start the excavation, the topsoil will be removed. Special tools like pickaxes and mattocks are used to break up and remove very hard compacted soil. Shovels and spades are used to clear away bulk debris. Other hand tools used in bulk cleanup work are hoes, rakes, forks, and the wheelbarrow to cart it away. In some circumstances, all of the soil will be fine sieved, from the wheelbarrow, before being dumped into a waste area.
