List of World Heritage Sites in Bulgaria

The List of World Heritage Sites in Bulgaria is a group of places chosen by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO was created for the "conservation and protection of the worldâ€™s inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science". The constitution of UNESCO was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries.

Bulgaria agreed to take part in the World Heritage Convention in 1974.

The World Heritage Site (WHS) list has developed over time. It is part of a process; and the list continues to grow.

There are nine WHS places in Bulgaria. The first four properties were added in the World Heritage List in 1979, and the last in 1985.

The Tentative List consists of sites which have been nominated. The evaluation process is not yet completed.
