Imperial units

The Imperial units or the Imperial system is a collection of measurement units. An Act of Parliament in 1824 created it from traditional English units. Commonwealth countries used this system from 1824 until they changed to the metric system. The imperial system is very similar to the American system but there are some differences.

The British nautical mile used to be 6080 feet. In 1970 the UK adopted the international definition of 1852 metres.
