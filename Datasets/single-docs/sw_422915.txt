Bahá'í calendar

The Bahá'í calendar, named the Badí‘ calendar ("badí‘" means "wondrous" or "unique"), is a solar calendar used by Bábism and the Bahá'í Faith. 

The calendar was created by the Báb and refined by Bahá'u'lláh and the Universal House of Justice. 

Each year starts on "Naw-Rúz", the vernal equinox (in March), and has 19 months. Each month has 19 days. An extra 4 or 5 days are added between the last two months so that the next year also starts on the equinox. Each day begins at sunset. The time of sunset and the time of the equinox are calculated by astronomers. 

The months are known by their Arabic names. The days within each month also use the same names. Here they are with their usual English translations:
Each group of 19 years is called a Váhid. 

Each group of 19 Váhids is called a Kull-i-Shay’.

Year 1 of the Badí' calendar started at Naw-Rúz in 1844 A.D.
