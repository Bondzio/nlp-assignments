Polar climate

Polar climate has temperatures below for much of the year. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, a polar climate is one in which no monthly average goes above . If the temperature is between and in the warmest month, it is a tundra climate. If the average temperature is below in the warmest month, it is an ice cap climate. These climates are found near the poles and on high mountains. There is usually little precipitation because the air is so dry. Ice cap climates are in the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Iceland, Antarctica and at high altitude.
