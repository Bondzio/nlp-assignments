The Power of Four

"The Power of Four" is a joint anthem for the British and Irish Lions, a rugby union team. It was created by Neil Myers.

From the four corners of our lands<br>
We're united, hand in hand<br>
Together<br>
We're stronger<br>
We join and proud we stand <br>
Now the day has come, we are one<br>
Standing tall for our Lions' call<br>
We're stronger<br>
Together<br>
We are the power of four.
