Albert Günther

Albert Günther FRS, (Albert Karl Ludwig Gotthilf Günther, also Albert Charles Lewis Gotthilf Günther, 3 October 1830 – 1 February 1914), was a German-born British zoologist, ichthyologist, and herpetologist. Günther is currently ranked the second-most productive reptile taxonomist. He described more than 340 reptile species.

He joined the British Museum in 1857, under Richard Owen and John Edward Gray. His first task was to classify 2000 snake specimens. After the death of Gray in 1875, Günther was appointed Keeper of Zoology at the Natural History Museum, a position he held until 1895. 

The major work of his life was the eight-volume "Catalogue of Fishes" (1859–1870, Ray Society). He also worked on the reptiles and amphibians in the museum collection. In 1864, he founded "The Zoological Record" and was editor for six years.
