The Proud Family is an American animated television series. It was on the Disney Channel from September 15, 2001 to August 19, 2005.

"The Proud Family" was created by Bruce W. Smith. It was produced by Jambalaya Studios. It was originally scripted for the Nickelodeon channel. However, Disney Channel took it and began airing in September 2001. Some of the episodes in later seasons were produced using Adobe Flash.
