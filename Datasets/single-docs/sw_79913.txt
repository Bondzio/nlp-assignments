Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance, sometimes called scouting, is the act of exploring to gain military information. Often referred to as "recce" (UK, Canada and Australia, ) or "recon" (U.S., ), the associated formal verb is "reconnoitre" (British spelling) or "reconnoiter" (American spelling). In informal English, both "recce" and "recon" are often also used as a verb. The term is sometimes used in non military contexts.

Often, units sent out for reconnaissance are armed only for self-defense. They rely on stealth to gather information. Others are well-enough armed to also deny information to the enemy by fighting and or destroying their reconnaissance parties.

"Reconnaissance-in-force" (RIF) is a method of probing an enemy's position. An attack, even with a small force, may get a strong reaction by the enemy. Hopefully that reveals the enemy's strength, deployment, and other tactical information. The RIF commander can fall back with the information or expand the conflict into a full engagement. Other methods consist of hit-and-run tactics using moving very fast. In some cases light-armored vehicles are used for added fire superiority, as the need arises.
