Miragoâne

Miragoâne (Kréyòl: "Miragwàn") is a port city in southwestern Haiti. It is the capital city of the Nippes "Département".

The city is on the coast of the "Miragoâne" Bay, in the Gonâve Channel of the Gulf of Gonâve, about 100 km south of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has four "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Miragoâne, Fonds-des-Nègres, Paillant and Petite-Rivière-de-Nippes.

The town was founded by English during the 17th century on the coast of a well-protected bay.

The name Miragoâne comes from "Miraguano", the name given by the Taíno people to the 
"Étang de Miragoâne", the second largest lake of Haiti; the town is near the lake.

During a civil war in 1883, the town was destroyed.

Miragoâne is an important port; coffee, fruits and wood are sent to other countries and other parts of Haiti from here. Used products (like clothes and cars) como to this port from Miami.
