Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon

Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon (born Lucy Christiana Sutherland, 13 June 1863 â€“ 20 April 1935) was a British fashion designer in late 19th and early 20th centuries. She used the professional name Lucile as a designer. Duff-Gordon was a widely known innovator in couture styles and in fashion industry relations.

Duff-Gordon was born in London, and died at 71 in Putney, London, of breast cancer. Duff-Gordon had survived the RMS Titanic disaster in April 1912.

Using the first professional models, Lucy started the fashion show known as a "mannequin parade". These were the first runway or catwalk-style shows. She launched slit skirts and low necklines. She popularized less restrictive corsets, and simpler lingerie. 

Duff-Gordon opened branches of her London house, "Lucile Ltd", in Paris, New York City, and Chicago, dressing royal and noble clients, and stage and film personalities.
