Mean Girls

Mean Girls is a 2004 American teen comedy movie starring Lindsay Lohan. 

It's about a teenage girl, Cady Heron, who used to be home schooled in Africa but moves to the United States and has to go to a normal high school in Evanston, Illinois. On her first day at school, she hates it. She thinks it is a bit weird because she cannot go to the toilet when she wants, cannot write in green ink and has to stay in the same seat everytime she goes into a lesson. On the second day it becomes more successful as she makes new friends, Janice and Damian. When they skip a lesson, Janice and Damian give her a map of the school eating area. It is arranged into different sorts of people and their personalities. At lunch time Cady is on her way to sit with her new friends but is interrupted, then Regina, Gretchen and Karen ("The Plastics") ask her to sit with them and so she sits with them.

Soon, Cady joins the Plastics, and Janice devises a plan to shatter them. Cady convinces Regina to eat these bars that will make her gain weight instead of lose weight.

However, Cady gets too much into the Plastics, and throws a party at her parents' house without their permission. She tries to hook up with Regina's boyfriend, but he does not like her because she's just like a Plastic now. Janice tells Cady that she's just one of the Plastics now. Low grades in calculus class force Cady to rethink her plans. She joins the decathlon team.


"Mean Girls 2" was released in 2011 on DVD. None of the actors from "Mean Girls" were in it apart from Tim Meadows.
