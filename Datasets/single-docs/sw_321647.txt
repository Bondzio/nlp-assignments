Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run

Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run is a short movie from Sony Pictures Animation. The movie is a spin-off of the movie "Open Season" and stars Boog and Elliot, the main characters of the "Open Season" franchise.

Bob and Bobbie (Georgia Engel) leave the trailer to go skinny-dipping, leaving Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron) to guard the cinnamon buns they left on the counter. Boog (Martin Lawrence) and Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) sneak into the camp and discover there's buns in trailer. Unfortunately, Weenie is guarding the door.

To avoid waking Weenie, Boog and Elliot climb onto the roof and Boog ties Elliot to the end of a rope and lowers him through the open skylight. Unfortunately, Elliot is distracted by the buns and salivates, waking Mr. Weenie, who bites his backside, accidentally pulling Boog into the trailer. Bob and Bobbie hear noises from outside and think that Weenie is being attacked. Bobbie puts on a towel to go investigate. Shocked by what she sees, she accidentally drops her towel, revealing her bare tattooed buttocks (as well as everything else) to a passing police car, whose driver pulls over, startled by the naked woman. Elliot runs out of the window looking for a place to hide, leaving Boog incriminatingly holding Weenie by the tail when the police officer, Gordy (Gordon Tootoosis), breaks into the camper. Mr. Weenie says to Boog, "You are so busted," and Boog responds, "Tell me about it."


"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run" was exclusively released on January 30, 2007, as a special feature on the "Open Season" DVD and Blu-ray. 

The DVD copy of the short film was released on May 9, 2007 in Japan and it debuted on TV in Sweden on December 27, 2009.
