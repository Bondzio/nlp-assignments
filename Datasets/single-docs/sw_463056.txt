Lepus (constellation)

Lepus is a constellation south of the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for hare. The hare is not from any figure in Greek mythology. Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It is one of the 88 modern constellations. It is below the constellation Orion (the hunter). It is known as a hare being chased by Orion.

This constellation should not be mixed up with Lupus, the wolf.

There is one Messier Object in Lepus, M79. It is a globular cluster of magnitude 8.0, 42,000 light-years from Earth. It is one of the few globular clusters seen in the Northern Hemisphere winter.
