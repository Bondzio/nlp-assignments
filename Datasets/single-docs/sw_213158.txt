Alemannia Aachen

The Aachener Turn- und Sportverein Alemannia 1900 (known as Alemannia Aachen) is a football club which plays in Germany's Regionalliga. The club is based in Aachen. The name Alemannia should stress being from the west of Germany. The club was founded in 1900 by students who played football.

"Alemannia" has the strange nickname of "the Potato Beetles" (Kartoffelk√§fer). This is because of their striped yellow-black jerseys, which make them look like the insects.
