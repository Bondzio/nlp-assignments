Cristiano Ronaldo

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985 in Funchal, Madeira), better known as Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portuguese footballer. He plays for the Spanish club Real Madrid and the Portugal national team.

In 2003, Cristiano Ronaldo joined Manchester United from Sporting Portugal. He was given the number 7. This number had been worn by George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham before him.

In the 2007/08 season, he became the only player in the last 25 years to win both the "FIFA World Player of the Year" and the "Young Player of the Year" awards in the same season. In that season, he scored a total of 42 goals and won the European Golden Boot, an award which is given to the top scorer of league matches of every European national league. 

Ronaldo is currently the second most expensive professional football player of all time, after moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid for approximately £80m. At his presentation as a Real Madrid player, 80,000 people greeted him at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. This is the world record, passing Argentine legend Diego Maradona's presentation for Napoli.

In 2017, he became the first player to reach 100 goals in the UEFA Champions League.

Ronaldo became a father on 17 June 2010 following the birth of his son, named Cristiano, and nicknamed by the family 'Cristianinho', was born in the United States, and Ronaldo announced that he had full custody. Ronaldo has never revealed information about his son's mother.

He is a Roman Catholic. Ronaldo does not have tattoos because it would prevent him from donating blood.

He opened his first fashion boutique under the name "CR7" (his initials and shirt number) on his native-born island of Madeira, Portugal in 2006.
