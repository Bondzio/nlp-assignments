Ronald David Laing

Ronald David Laing (born Glasgow (Scotland, 7th of October 1927; died 23rd August 1989), was a Scottish psychiatrist who described mental illness, especially psychosis. 

Laing is known for his theories on the causes of the mental perturbations. His theory on the "schizogenous" (?) parents or schizophrenia was to exclude him from the psychiatric orthodoxy of his times. He often was connected in thought with the movement against psychiatry called antipsychiatry, although he rejected that epithet.
