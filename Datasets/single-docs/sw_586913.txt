Zhang Tianfu

Zhang Tianfu (,  21 September 1910 – 4 June 2017) was a Chinese agronomist and expert in tea processing, known for promoting processing of oolong.

In 1936, he introduced the tea processing machines from Japan, facilitating the automation of the domestic tea industry. From 1942 to 1944, he resumed teaching at Fukien Christian University.

He was targeted at the start of the Anti-Rightist Movement and subsequently was exiled to Chong'an until 1962. The Cultural Revolution followed, and Zhang was exiled to Shouning. Despite his exile, Zhang continued scientific research. He was rehabilitated in 1980.
