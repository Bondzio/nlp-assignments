Verne Gagne

Laverne Clarence "Verne" Gagne (February 26, 1926 â€“ April 27, 2015) was an American professional wrestler, football player, wrestling trainer, and wrestling promoter. He was the owner and promoter of the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association (AWA). He remained in this position until 1991, when the company folded.

On January 26, 2009, Gagne got into an altercation with Helmut Gutmann, a 97-year-old resident of the Bloomington, Minnesota facility where they both resided. According to Gutmann's widow, who was not present during the altercation, Gagne picked Gutmann up and hurled him to the floor, then broke his hip by pulling back on his body. Gutmann was admitted to the hospital, and died on February 14 from complications of the injury. 

On February 25, 2009, the older man's death was officially ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County medical examiner's office.

On the night of April 27, 2015, Gagne died in Bloomington, Minnesota at the age of 89 from Alzheimer's disease.
