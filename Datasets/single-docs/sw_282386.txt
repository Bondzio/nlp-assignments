Poularde Albufera

Poularde Albufera, (Chicken Albufera) is a chicken dish named in honour of the Duke of Albufera. It sometimes credited to French chef Adolphe Dugléré, who invented several other dishes. However, as Dugléré was only ten years old when Albufera fell out of favour with the king, and had his French title of nobility taken away, it is more likely that Poularde Albufera was created by Antonin Carême, who trained Dugléré

It consists of poached chicken with a garnish of vol-au-vents filled with quenelles, cocks' kidneys, mushrooms and truffles in Albufera sauce.
