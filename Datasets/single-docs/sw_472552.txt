Bound for Glory (2014)

Bound for Glory (2014) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on October 12, 2014 at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. The pay-per-view was a collaboration with the Japanese puroresu promotion Wrestle-1. It was the tenth Bound for Glory event that TNA held and was also the fourth and last event in TNA's 2014 pay-per-view schedule. The event was aired on tape delay because of the time difference. Taz and Mike Tenay were not in Japan at the event and instead did commentary from TNA headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee.

There were eight matches on the card. The main event saw The Great Muta and Tajiri defeat James Storm and The Great Sanada.
