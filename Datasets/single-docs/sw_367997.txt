Umuwa, South Australia

Umuwa is an Aboriginal community on the Aá¹‰angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is the administrative centre for the local government of the APY. Umuwa is about north-west of Marla and south west of Alice Springs. There are about 80 people living at Umuwa.

Umuwa was established in 1991. Mail arrives in Umuwa once per week by air mail. Supplies arrive by truck every week. Unlike larger settlements on the APY lands, Umuwa does not have a general store. There was a solar power station built near the town in 2003, but it stopped working in 2011 and will be dismantled. As with most APY settlements, Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service television are available. There is also a health clinic and a police station.
