Smuglyanka

Smuglyanka (Russian: Смугля́нка, meaning "the dark girl") is a Russian song. The lyrics tell of a man who met a pretty woman gathering grapes and tries to seduce her, but finds out that she is a partisan. She then convinces him to join the partisans as well. It was written in 1940 by Yakov Shvedov (lyrics) and Anatoliy Grigorevich Novikov (music). The song was meant to glorify female partisans in the Russian Civil War. The song is still very popular.
