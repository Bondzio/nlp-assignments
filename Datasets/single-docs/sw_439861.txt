West End of London

The West End of London (usually referred to as the West End) is an area of central London.

It contains many of the city's major tourist attractions, shops, businesses, government buildings, and entertainment venues (including the commercial :West End theatres). Use of the term began in the early 19th century to describe fashionable areas to the west of Charing Cross. For strategic planning, the area is one of two "international centres" in the London Plan.

The West End is the second most expensive place in the world in which to rent office space, after Tokyo.
