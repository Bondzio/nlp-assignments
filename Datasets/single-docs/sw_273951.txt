Owens Lake

Owens Lake is a mostly dry lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada of Inyo County, California, located about south of Lone Pine, California. Unlike most dry lakes in the Basin and Range Province that have been dry for thousands of years, Owens held water until 1924. Today, some of the flow of the river has been restored, and the lake now has some water.
