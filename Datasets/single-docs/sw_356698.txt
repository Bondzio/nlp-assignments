Bighorn sheep

The bighorn sheep ("Ovis canadensis") is a species of sheep. They live in North America. Their name was given to them because of their large horns. Their horns can weigh up to 30 pounds (14 kg). However, the sheep themselves weigh up to 300 pounds (140Â kg). In a genetic testing, it was found that there are three subspecies of bighorn sheep, one of which, is endangered ("Ovis canadensis sierrae").

The bighorn sheep came from Siberia. They crossed to North America over the Bering land bridge. The population grew in the millions. It then became one of many mythologies of the Native Americans. By 1900, the population got smaller to several thousands. Many organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America, has helped increase the population.
