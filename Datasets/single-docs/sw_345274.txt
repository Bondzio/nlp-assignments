Governorates of Saudi Arabia

Governorates are the second level of regional administration within Saudi Arabia. Each of Saudi Arabia's 13 emirates is divided into governorates. Governorates are then divided into sub-governorates. Governorates in Saudi Arabia can be either "Category A" or "Category B", depending on population size.
