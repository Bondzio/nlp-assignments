People's Palace

The People's Palace is a large building in Bucharest, Romania. It was built by the then-dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu in the 1980s. Today the Romanian Parliament meets in the building. Many Parliament members have offices inside. The building faces an avenue built to look like the Champs-Élysées in Paris.
