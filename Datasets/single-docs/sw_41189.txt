María Esther de Capovilla

María Esther de Capovilla (September 14, 1889 – August 27, 2006) was an Ecuadorian supercentenarian. She was the world's oldest living person between May 29, 2004, aged 114 years 258 days, and her death from pneumonia on August 27, 2006, aged 116 years 347 days. At the time of her death she was verified as the sixth oldest person on record, and later the fifth oldest when the case of Shigechiyo Izumi was discounted. She remained the world's fifth oldest verified person until Misao Okawa surpassed her age in February 2015. Following Capovilla's death, Elizabeth Bolden became the world's oldest person.
