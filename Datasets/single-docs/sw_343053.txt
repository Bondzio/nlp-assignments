Rudolph Nureyev

Rudolf Khametovich Nureyev (17 March 1938 â€“ 6 January 1993) was a Russian ballet dancer. He was one of the most celebrated dancers of the 20th century. In 1961 he defected to the West, despite KGB efforts to prevent him. For some years he partnered Dame Margot Fonteyn. 

The "Dictionary of Dance" says "His repertoire was enormous, including all the classics and the modern standards". After his period with Fonteyn, Nureyev worked in several countries.

Nureyev was director, principal dancer and choreographer of "Nureyev and Friends" on Broadway (197475) and was artistic director of the Paris Opera House from 1983 to 1989. He promoted junior dancers, such as Sylvie Guillem, and commissioned new works. In the last years of his life he took up conducting.

Nureyev was gay. He and his partner, Erik Bruhn, died of AIDS.
