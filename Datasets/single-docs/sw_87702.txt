Public administration

Public Administration has two meanings. First it refers to the implementation (or "putting into action") of government policy. Second, it is an academic discipline that studies this implementation and prepares civil servants for working in the public service (the non-political part of the government). 

Public administration aims to help improve management of the government and improve policies so that government can function better. Public administrators manage public programs, translate politics into the programs and services that citizens use every day. In universities, professors of public administration study government decision making, analyze policies, and think about how to improve policies and programs.
