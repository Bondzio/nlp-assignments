Yucatán Peninsula

The Yucatán Peninsula is a peninsula in North America. It separates the Caribbean Sea from the Gulf of Mexico. The peninsula is east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a northwestern geographic divider, separating Central America from the rest of North America.

The peninsula includes the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche, and Quintana Roo; the northern part of Belize; and Guatemala's northern department of El Petén. Mexican states on the isthmus to the south and west of the peninsula include Chiapas and Tabasco. 

It is also believed that this was the impact site of an asteroid that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs
