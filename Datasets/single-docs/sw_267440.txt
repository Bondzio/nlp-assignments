Tellurite

Tellurite is an ion. Its chemical formula is TeO. They are some of the more stable tellurium compounds. They are weak oxidizing agents. In slightly acidic conditions, it makes hydrogen tellurite, HTeO. When it is very acidic, it makes tellurous acid. They are normally made by reacting tellurium dioxide with a metal oxide. 

Tellurite is also a rare mineral. This mineral consists of tellurium dioxide. It is a yellow to white mineral. It is in areas that tend to oxidize minerals (oxidation zone). Otherwise telluride or native tellurium would be there.
