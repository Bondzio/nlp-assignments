Eric F. Wieschaus

Eric Francis Wieschaus (born June 8, 1947) is an American developmental biologist. 

A lot of Wieschaus' research focuses on embryogenesis in the fruit fly "Drosophila melanogaster" and it specifically focuses on the patterning which occurs in the early Drosophila embryo. In 1995, Wieschaus shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward B. Lewis "for their discoveries concerning the genetic control of early embryonic development".
