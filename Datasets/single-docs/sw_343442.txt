Telephone numbers in Azerbaijan

Telephone numbers in Azerbaijan follow the recommended format for its telephone numbering plan.

A caller from outside Azerbaijan would dial the international access number, usually 00. They then dial the country code which is 994 for Azerbaijan. Then they dial the two-digit area code, and then the seven-digit local number. 

For a local call one simply dials the local number.

On 1 August 2011, Azerbaijan reorganized its national numbering plan for area codes. Only the area codes of Baku, Sumqayit, and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (area codes 12, 18 and 36) stayed the same as before. The following tables list both the old and new area codes.
