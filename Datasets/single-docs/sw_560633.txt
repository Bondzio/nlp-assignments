Crêt de la Neige

Crêt de la Neige is a high mountain in the "commune" of Thoiry. It is the highest peak in the Jura Mountains and the department of Ain in France.

It is in the Jura Mountains Regional Natural Park ().

Crêt de la Neige is between the "communes" of Lélex (to the northwest) and Thoiry (to the southeast) in the Ain department.

It is found in the "Haute Chaîne", the most eastern and highest chain of the French Jura mountains; it is in the "Pays de Gex" (the Arrondissement of Gex, Ain department), about to the northwest of the city of Geneva.

The Crêt de la Neige is surrounded by the plain of the "Pays de Gex" to the east and the Valserine valley (a valley among the Jura mountains formed by the Valserine river) to the west.

From the summit (or near the summit because it is covered with shrubs and trees), it is possible to see Geneva and the "Pays de Gex" and there is a 360° view over the Lake Geneva, the Valserine valley, La Dôle (a peak of the Jura mountains that is in Switzerland) and the Alps. On a clear day, it is possible to see the Vosges mountains and the Black Forest.

In the past, the official elevation given for the Crêt de la Neige was , and so it appears in old maps, only higher than the near peak of Reculet . But recent studies made by the Institut géographique national (IGN) in Villeurbanne found that the true altitude of the Crêt de la Neige is above sea level.

The easiest route to get to the Crêt de la Neige is from the Tiocan lookout point that is beyond Thoiry.
