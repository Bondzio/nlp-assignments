X Japan

X Japan is a Japanese rock band. They were formed in 1982 by Yoshiki. They have sold over 30 million albums and singles and over 2 million videos to date. X Japan stopped making music in 1997, but reunited in 2007. They performed their first world tour live in Hong Kong in 2009. They played to 20,000 people in two days.

Some visual kei bands are influenced by X Japan. 

The band was first called "X" but because the letter X was already the name of another band they changed their name to "X Japan" to avoid confusion.
