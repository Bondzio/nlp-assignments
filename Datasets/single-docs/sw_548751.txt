David Woodard

Woodard invented a fictional psychoactive machine called the Feraliminal Lycanthropizer. At the end of the 20th century he fabricated replicas of an actual psychoactive device called the Dreamachine.

Woodard is also known for his work with Nueva Germania, a settlement in Paraguay. His German book of correspondence "Five Years", coauthored by Swiss novelist Christian Kracht, describes some of the humanitarian work performed there.â€‹
