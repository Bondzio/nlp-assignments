During the United States Grand Prix, Whiting was involved the tyre controversy. None of the tyres which Michelin had brought to Indianapolis were safe to use. Michelin was unable to produce new tyres to replace the seven teams' unsafe tyres. Michelin asked Whiting to install a chicane in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway instead. Whiting refused to make the change. He said this would be unfair to the teams who were able to race safely on the existing track.
