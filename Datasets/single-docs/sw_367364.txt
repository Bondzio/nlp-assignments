Mount Woodroffe

Mount Woodroffe is South Australia's highest peak. It is above sea level. The mountain is known to Pitjantjatjara speakers as Ngarutjaranya. In their Dreaming, the mountain represents the spirit being Ngintaka.

Mount Woodroffe is in the far northwest of South Australia, in the Musgrave Ranges. The mountain range rises about 700â€“800 metres above the plains around it. The rock is mostly granite and gneiss.

Mount Woodroffe was named by William Gosse, who first saw it on 20 July 1873. He named it after George Woodroffe Goyder, another early explorer of South Australia and the Northern Territory. Access to the mountain is restricted. Permission is needed to enter the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands.
