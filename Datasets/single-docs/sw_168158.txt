Mathematical induction

Mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth. It can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers (all the positive whole numbers). The idea is that 
then

In the careful language of mathematics:

Because it's true for 1, then it is true for 1+1 (=2, by the induction step), then it is true for 2+1 (=3), then it is true for 3+1 (=4), and so on. 

An example of proof by induction:

Prove that for all natural numbers "n":

Proof: 

First, the statement can be written: for all natural numbers "n"

By induction on "n",

First, for "n"=1:

so this is true.

Next, assume that for some "n"="n" the statement is true. That is,:

Then for "n"="n"+1:

can be rewritten 

Since formula_12

Hence the proof is correct.

Mathematical induction is often stated with the starting value 0 (rather than 1). In fact, it will work just as well with a variety of starting values. Here is an example when the starting value is 3. 
The sum of the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_15degrees.

The initial starting value is 3, and the interior angles of a triangle is formula_16degrees. 
Assume that the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_15degrees. Add on a triangle which makes the figure a formula_5-sided polygon, and that increases the count of the angles by 180 degrees formula_20degrees. Proved.

There are a great many mathematical objects for which proofs by mathematical induction works. The technical term is a "well-ordered set".

The same idea can work to "define", as well as prove.

Define formula_1th degree cousin:

There is a set of axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers which is based on mathematical induction. This is called "Peano's Axioms". The undefined symbols are | and =.
The axioms are

One can then define the operations of addition and multiplication and so on by mathematical induction. For example:
