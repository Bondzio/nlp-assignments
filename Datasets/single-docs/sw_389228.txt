A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture

A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture, Op. 21 is an orchestral work by Felix Mendelssohn. He wrote the work when he was 17 in 1827. Many years later, he wrote more music for Shakespeare's play. These additions include the famous "Wedding March". The fairies of the play are represented with light, skipping music, the lovers by romantic themes, and the workmen by clownish music. Bottom is represented by a drone bass that sounds like the bray (call) of a donkey.
