Invasion of Japan

The invasion of Japan was a planned military action, called "Operation Downfall". This was to be the Allied forces invasion of Japan to end the Second World War. After the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese surrendered, so there was no need for an invasion. Operation Downfall was cancelled.
