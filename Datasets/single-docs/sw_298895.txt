Pont du Gard

The Pont du Gard is a Roman aqueduct in Southern France. It is in the Gard département, in the area of the commune of Vers-Pont-du-Gard. The name should mean "Bridge over the Gard" (the river Gardon).
The aquaeduct supplied the city of Nîmes with water. It has a length of nearly 50 kilometres. The bridge is 49 metres high and has bows on three levels. It was probably built in the 1st century. In 1985, the Pont du Gard was classified a World Heritage Site.
