Melksham

Melksham () is a medium-sized English town, on the River Avon in the county of Wiltshire. It is east of the city of Bath and south of Chippenham. Melksham is west of Devizes and north of Warminster on the A350 national route. 

The name is thought to come from "meolc", the Old English word for milk, and "ham", a village. On John Speed's map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt both Melkesam (for the hundred) and Milsham (for the town itself). There are nine schools in Melksham. Melksham also has a very popular football team in a small league. The population of Melksham in 2014 was estimated to be 19,344.
