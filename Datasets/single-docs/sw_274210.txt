Defenestration

Defenestration is the action of throwing someone or something out of a window. The word comes from the Latin "de-" (down or away from) and "fenestra" (window or opening).

The word comes from two events in history, which both took place in Prague. In 1419, seven town officials were thrown from the Town Hall, starting the Hussite War. In 1618, two Imperial governors and their secretary were thrown from Prague Castle, which started the Thirty Years War. These two event, particularly in 1618, were called the Defenestration of Prague and gave rise to the word and the idea.
