Domitianus II (usurper)

Domitian was a usurper (a pretender) to the position of emperor in either 270 or 271 AD in Gaul (modern France) during the reign of Aurelian and is one of the so-called Gallic Emperors. He was probably killed after reigning only a year.

Not much is know about Domitianus. However, two coins exist that show the Emperor (one is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England). 

He is also mentioned by the Byzantine Historian Zosimus and in the book "Historia Augusta" as well.
