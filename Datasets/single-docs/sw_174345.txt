Biltong

Biltong is dried meat that was first made by the Boers in South Africa. Strips of meat are seasoned with salt, coriander seeds, pepper and vinegar then hung to dry in the shade. It is not at all similar to beef jerky according to many South Africans, some of whom refer to beef jerk as tasting "like boot leather".
