Lord Don't Slow Me Down

Lord Don't Slow Me Down is a rockumentary movie. It looks back on British band Oasis' "Don't Believe the Truth" world tour. The tour took place from May 2005 to March 2006. The movie is directed by Baillie Walsh. It went platinum in the UK.

A handful of fans-only private screenings took place around the world. The world premiere of the movie at the Directors Guild Theater in New York City on 4 November 2006 as part of the CMJ Film Festival. The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on 19 November, at 11:50pm. It was a heavily edited version with about 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The movie was first shown to go along with Oasis' compilation album "Stop the Clocks", released on 20 November 2006. A preview of the movie was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005.

The movie features a new Oasis song also called "Lord Don't Slow Me Down", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions. Gallagher described it as being ""one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!"". He has also said that his girlfriend thought it was the only Oasis song you could dance to. The song was left off "Don't Believe the Truth" because Gallagher felt that including it would have meant he'd have been singing too many songs on the record. Italian footballer Alessandro Del Piero also appears in the video signing a shirt for Noel.
