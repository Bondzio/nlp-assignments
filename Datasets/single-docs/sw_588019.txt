Ernestina Herrera de Noble

Ernestina Herrera de Noble (June 7, 1925 – June 14, 2017) was an Argentine publisher and executive. She was the largest shareholder of the Grupo Clarín media conglomerate and director of the flagship "Clarín" newspaper. She was the first woman to become director of a mainstream newspaper in South America.

Ernestina Laura Herrera was born in Buenos Aires in 1925. She became a Flamenco dancer and met the founding publisher of "Clarín", Roberto Noble, around 1950.

As his widow, she inherited a controlling stake in "Clarín", Argentina's most widely circulated newspaper since 1965. Despite its large circulation, however, "Clarín" suffered financial difficulties when Mrs. Noble inherited the director's post. 

Under her leadership, "Clarín" extended its reach into Argentine media, purchasing two second-ranked outlets, Radio Mitre and Channel 13, in 1990, Multicanal Cable TV in 1992, and other stations and magazines. She extended the partnership with "La Nación" by leading "Clarín" into a joint wire service, "Diarios y Noticias" (DyN), in 1982, and into a holding company in 1997.

de Noble died on June 14, 2017 from pneumonia in Buenos Aires, aged 92.
