Supercentenarian

A supercentenarian is someone who has lived to the age of 110 years or more, something achieved by only one in a thousand centenarians. A very small number of supercentenarians have lived to be 115. Early uses of the word meant a person well over 100, but now it is just known as people who are 110 or older.

Jeanne Calment had the world's longest verified human lifespan. Since May 12, 2016 the current oldest verified living person is Violet Brown.
