Yom HaShoah

Yom HaShoah (, "Holocaust Day") is the official day for remembering the Holocaust in Israel. It is also widely observed by Jews in other countries. Its date on the Jewish calendar is 27 Nisan. (This date usually falls in April or May.) This date was chosen because it was during the Warsaw ghetto uprising.
