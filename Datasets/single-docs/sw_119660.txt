Landi Kotal Tehsil

Landi Kotal or Landikotal () in Pakistan is the highest point on the Khyber Pass, 1,072 metres above sea level. It is on a route across the mountains from the near-border city, Peshawar. Landi Kotal is often visited by tourists and can be reached by train or road.

Landi Kotal is the main shopping centre for both the Shinwari and Afridi tribes.

In 1897, during British rule, the Afridis attacked Landi Kotal and other posts in the Khyber Pass. The British counter-attacked with a force of 34,500 men under Sir William Lockhart, defeating the Afridis. 

In 1925 work began on a railway line linking Jamrud to Landi Kotal.
