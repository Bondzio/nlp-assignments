Cymmer, Rhondda Cynon Taf

Cymmer is a village in the Rhondda Valley Wales. Cymmer is located in the lower Rhondda Valley about half way between Treorchy and Pontypridd.

Cymmer, which is now seen as a part of Porth takes its name from the old Welsh word that describes a spot where two rivers of the same name join.
Before coal mining, not many people lived in Cymmer. Cymmer was one of the first villages within the Rhondda Valley. The Lewis colliery had many examples of the pithead gear in South Wales Rhondda Heritage Park now has the only pithead gear in the Rhondda. In 1847 George Insole opened his first mine in Cymmer. In 1855 he opened a second pit in Cymmer near the old pit. 

Tuesday 15th July 1856 at the Old Pit in Cymmer, there was an explosion which was Britainâ€™s largest mining accident at that time. One hundred and sixty men and boys lowered down the shaft to begin their shift when the explosion took place. 
114 people were killed. The explosion was caused by miners carrying open flames which lit pockets of gas. 

Cymmer chapel 
The earliest independent Chapel in the Rhondda appointed its first Minister in 1752. Little is known of its earlier history although it is known to have been made in 1740.

St John Church is situated in a prominent position on the hillside above the earlier settlement of Cymmer centred round the Cymmer Chapel.

Cymmer is situated on the A4119 road half a mile from its junction with the A4058 road.
