In the Air Tonight

"In the Air Tonight" is a soft rock song by English drummer and singer Phil Collins. It was first released on Collins' first solo album "Face Value" in 1981. The song has been featured in many advertisements such as Cadbury and movies such as "The Hangover" (2009).

The song has a long running false rumour that it was about a drowning that Collins had witnessed. American rapper Eminem made reference to this in the song "Stan".
