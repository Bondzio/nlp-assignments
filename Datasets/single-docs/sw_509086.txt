Catadioptric sensor

A catadioptric sensor is a visual sensor that contains mirrors and lenses. Video cameras are limited as to how much they can see in one view. They can lose sight of what they are recording if something causes them to move suddenly. Mirrors can be carefully arranged with lenses to allow the camera lens to see a much wider field of view. They are often used in robotics. One example is a catadioptric sensor used to inspect the inside of a cylindrical pipe.
