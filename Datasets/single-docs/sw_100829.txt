Tatars

Tatars are a Turkic-speaking ethnic group. Most Tatars live in Russia (forming the majority in Tatarstan), as well as in such countries as Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.

Russian historian D. Iskhakov wrote in 2000:“the real history of Tatars, of the people in every respect historical, is not written yet”. However, a book by independent Tatar historian Galy Yenikeyev about the unwritten history of the Tatars 
claims to have new facts.
