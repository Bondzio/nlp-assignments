Robb was born in Denver, Colorado, the daughter of Janet, an interior designer, and David Robb, an architect. She was named after her maternal great-grandmother, Anna Sophie, and her paternal grandmother, Anna Marie. Robb is of Danish, English, Irish, Scottish, and Swedish descent. She grew up in a Christian home and was home-schooled. She started taking an interest in acting and began by performing in front of 500 individuals on her church stage. She competed in dance and gymnastics for four and a half years, but quit in order to focus on acting. In 2009, the "Arapahoe Herald" reported that she was attending Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado. She graduated in 2012.

At age 9, she was scouted by an agent, and she and her mother drove down to Los Angeles. After several auditions, she was given the opportunity to appear in a commercial, advertising Bratz dolls that would be aired nationally. After appearing in a commercial for McDonald's, Robb had a small role in the episode, "Number One Fan" of the television series "Drake & Josh". Her first major role was the title character in the television special, "". She wore a long brown wig for the role.

Robb's two big-screen appearances in 2005 were both adaptations of popular children's books. She starred as Opal in "Because of Winn-Dixie" and as the competitive and rude Violet Beauregarde in Tim Burton's remake of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". The latter was a major box office success worldwide, and helped escalate Robb's popularity among pre-teen audiences.

In 2005, Robb was the face of Trad Clothing, helping to design and model a fashion line for girls. In 2006, she had a guest role on the cartoon show, "Danny Phantom" as the voice of Danielle "Dani" Fenton.

She recorded a song for the soundtrack titled, "Keep Your Mind Wide Open", and the accompanying video received rotation on the Disney Channel. The song peaked at No. 90 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 during the week of March 1, 2007, giving Robb her first charting single. Robb was a fan of the book before being cast in the role, saying that it "touched me in a way I hadn't been touched by a book before".

Robb went on to appear in "The Reaping", "Have Dreams, Will Travel", "Jumper", and "Spy School". Despite negative reviews of the film overall, Robb's performance in "Sleepwalking" garnered praise. "Time" film critic Richard Schickel said: "There is a wonderful range to Robb's work...this is extraordinarily mature acting from someone this young and she wins our sympathy without once begging for it." In 2008, she recorded the voice of Mary Magdalene in "The Word of Promise: Next Generation â€“ New Testament: Dramatized Audio Bible". She also starred in "Race to Witch Mountain" (2009). In 2010, she appeared in "The Space Between". She then starred in "Soul Surfer", playing Bethany Hamilton, who continued to surf after losing her arm in a shark attack.
