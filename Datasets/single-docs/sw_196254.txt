Semi-postal

A semi-postal stamp or semipostal stamp is a philatelic term for a postage stamp issued to raising money for some purpose, usually for charity. Semi-postals have an additional monetary value ("surcharge"), devoted to that specific non-postal, charitable purpose and separated from the official postal value with a "+" sign.
