Von Sydow was one of the favourite actors of the Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman. He appeared in twelve Bergman films, most notably as the knight in "The Seventh Seal". This film is typical of the existentialist films of the mid-20th century. The knight plays a game of chess with death against the background crisis of the 13th century, with the Black Death and famine ongoing.
