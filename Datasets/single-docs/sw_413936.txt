Division of Charlton

The Division of Charlton is an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. It was created in 1984 and is named for Matthew Charlton, leader of the Australian Labor Party 1922-28. It covers the Hunter Region area of New South Wales. It includes the towns of Cardiff, Wallsend, Toronto, Morisset, Cooranbong, Glendale and Warners Bay.

In October 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission said the division would be renamed at the next election. Because of population changes New South Wales loses one division, and a new one will be created in Western Australia. To abolish a seat, the boundaries in New South Wales will have to be redrawn. The Division of Hunter will be abolished. Under the AEC rules, the names of original 1901 divisions are kept where possible. This means the area now covered by Charlton, will be included in a new division, renamed Hunter.

Greg Combet had been Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He was Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in the Gillard Government. In the 2013 election, the Liberal Party candidate, Kevin Baker, resigned after being involved with an offensive website. This happened after nominations closed, so the Liberal Party could not select a new candidate and Baker's name was still on the ballot papers.
