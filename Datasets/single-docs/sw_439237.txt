Bond girl

Bond girls are female characters in James Bond movies, books and video games. They play the love interest of Bond. There are no set rules on what kind of role a Bond girl plays. Some examples of Bond girls are Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Vivienne Michel.

Bond girls are usually aged in their early-to-mid 20s, about 10 years younger than Bond. Their normal dress is conventional without much jewellery. The dress style, however, varies. Halle Berry's was a character in "Die Another Day".

There have been only two movies in which Bond falls in love with the Bond girl. The most recent of them was "Casino Royale" in 2006, where Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd.

Ursula Andress played the character Honey Ryder in "Dr. No" (1962). Others who were Bond girls are Gemma Arterton and Rosamund Pike.
