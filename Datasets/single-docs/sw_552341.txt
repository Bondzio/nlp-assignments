Rodolfo Illanes (19 August 1958 - 25 August 2016) was a Bolivian politician. In 2016 he was the deputy Interior Minister when he was kidnapped by striking miners. He had gone to meet with the miners at Pandura. The miners were demanding more mining, the right to work for private companies, and greater union representation. When talks between the government and the miners failed, Illanes was beaten to death by his kidnappers.
