Reformism

Reformism is the belief that gradual democratic changes in a society would mean that a society's fundamental economic relations and political structures would change. This belief grew out of opposition to revolutionary socialism, which challenges that revolutions are necessary to fundamentally change a society. Someone who believes in reformism is a "reformist".
