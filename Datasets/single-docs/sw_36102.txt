Roquefort cheese

Roquefort cheese is a kind of blue cheese which comes from the south of France. It is made from sheep's milk. French laws about AOC say that only cheese from the region of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon (close to Millau) may be called Roquefort cheese. 

This cheese breaks into big pieces easily, and it is a very moist. Blue mould is added to Roquefort cheese, which gives it a particular taste. Roquefort is produced in big wheels which weigh around 3.5 kilograms, and which are about 10 cm thick. Roquefort needs to ripen around 5 months. It is best consumed April to October, but of course it is available year round. 

In the year 2002, there were seven Roquefort producers. The largest by far is Roquefort Société. Roquefort Papillon is also a well-known brand. The five other producers are Carles, Gabriel Coulet, Fromageries occitanes, Vernières and Le Vieux Berger.

Another cheese, which is similar, but made from the milk of cows, is Goregonzola.
