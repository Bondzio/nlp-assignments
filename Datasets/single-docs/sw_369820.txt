Doyle's Delight

Doyle's Delight is the highest peak in Belize. It is 1124 m high. 

The name Doyle's Delight was first used by Sharon Matola in a 1989 report. The name is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book "The Lost World" (1912). The book has the quote "there must be something wild and wonderful in a country such as this, and we're the men to find it out!".
