The road to hell is paved with good intentions

The road to hell is paved with good intentions is an idiom or proverb. It is about the difference between what someone intends to do and what they actually do. In other words, the road to failure is made easier by good intentions.

In the mid-12th century, Bernard of Clairvaux wrote, ""L'enfer est plein de bonnes volontés et désirs"" (hell is full of good wishes and desires). The sentence has been repeated many times in other languages and contexts.

In 1775, Samuel Johnson commented on "the unhappy failure of resolves" when he is reported saying, "Sir, hell is paved with good intentions."
