Paradise Lost

Paradise Lost is an epic poem by the 17th-century English writer John Milton. It was printed in 1667 though it was written nearly ten years earlier. The second part was printed in 1674. Most of the poem was written after Milton was blind.

The poem is about the Christian story of the Fall of Man: how Adam and Eve got out from the Garden of Eden and about the fallen angel Lucifer.
