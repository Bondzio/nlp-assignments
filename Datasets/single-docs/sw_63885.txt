Nynorsk

Nynorsk (New Norwegian) is one of the two official standards of the Norwegian language. The other is Bokmål. It is based on Norwegian dialects and was created by Ivar Aasen during the 19th century to show a Norwegian alternative to the Danish language (upon which Bokmål is based) which was commonly written in Norway at the time.
