Khedive

Khedive was the title of the Egyptian rulers from 1867 to 1914. It was given to the Turkish ruler of Egypt by the Ottoman Sultan, and removed by the British Empire when the Ottomans joined Germany in World War I.

The title was first used by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian general who seized power in Egypt as Wali (Governor) under the nominal overlordship of the Turks. His family was not recognized by the Sultan until the reign of Ismail Pasha. The last Khedive of Egypt was Abbas II, but the dynasty of Muhammed Ali continued to rule Egypt, though under British 'guidance'. This ended with the Egyptian revolution of 1952. The last member of the family who ruled was King Farouk I.
