Lungless salamanders

The Plethodontidae is a family of salamanders. They do not have lungs. They are called lungless salamanders. They live in British Columbia, Brazil, Sardinia, Alps and South Korea. They are the largest groups of salamanders.

There are over 350 lungless salamanders. Most of them are terrestrial and are active in daytime. Lungless salamanders may communicate with their nose. Slender salamanders are found in the Pacific Coast. They are sometimes called "worm salamanders". This is because they have slimmer (skinny) bodies than most salamanders. If touched, slender salamanders will bounce on the ground and then run away.
