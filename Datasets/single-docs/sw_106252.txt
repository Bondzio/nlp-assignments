Arizona Diamondbacks

The Arizona Diamondbacks are a Major League Baseball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. They were started in 1998. They play their home games at Chase Field. In 2001, they beat the New York Yankees to win their first (and only, so far) World Series, becoming the fastest new team to do this.

The team is also called the "D-Backs". They are named for the Diamondback Rattlesnake.
