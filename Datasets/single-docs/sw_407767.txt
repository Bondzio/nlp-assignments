Cirrhosis

Cirrhosis is a result of disease of the human liver. It is marked by replacement of liver tissue with scar tissues and fibrosis, leading to a loss of function in the liver. Cirrhosis is caused mostly by alcoholism, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, although there are other causes. Ascites (retention of fluid in the abdomen) is the most common complication for cirrhosis. It is linked to poor qualities of life and poor outcomes. Cirrhosis is generally not reversible.
