Spear

A spear is a weapon used in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. It is meant to primarily stab. But some spears can both stab and slash, although stabbing is still used more often. Some kinds of spears were also meant to be thrown.

A lance is a special spear used from horseback during medieval times. A pike is a very big spear for infantry to fight horsemen.
