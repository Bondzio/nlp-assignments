John Martin (painter)

John Martin (1789-1854) was an English romantic painter. 

John Martin was born in Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, on 19 July 1789. He was best known as an author of historical paintings. They were mostly inspirated by the Bible and poetical works. Martin's works were usually landscapes with little drawings of people. He was a friend of the poet Edwin Atherstone. They both liked to paint scenes of mass destruction. 

After the Belgian government bought "The Fall of Ninevah", the Belgian Academy made Martin a member. He also was made a Knight of the Order of Leopold by the king of Belgium.

John Martin died in Douglas, Isle of Man on 17 February 1854.
