Iga Province

The province had borders with Ise, ÅŒmi, Yamato, and Yamashiro.

The capital city of the province was Ueno, also called Iga-Ueno.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Iga Province were reformed in the 1870s.

Iga is a small mountain ringed basin (the Ueno basin) in the center of the Kansai region.

"Aekuni jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Iga.
