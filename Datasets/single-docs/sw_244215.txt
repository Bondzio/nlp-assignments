Take That: The Ultimate Tour

TAKE THAT: The Ultimate Tour is a video by boyband Take That. The video has a full length concert of Take That recorded at the City of Manchester Stadium on June 17, 2006 during the "Ultimate Tour 2006". It was released in the UK on November 6 2006 and internationally on December 7 2006. A limited edition version of the video was also released on October 23, 2006. It contained a bonus CD with 7 of their previous hit singles.

The DVD release does not include "Sure" (which was mixed the Gorillaz version of "Dirty Harry" for the tour), usually performed between "Apache 2006" and "Relight My Fire" for an unknown reason. However a few seconds of the footage can be seen in the various DVD menus.

The DVD was re-released on November 5, 2007 on HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc.
