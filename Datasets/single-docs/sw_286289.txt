Jimmy Snuka

James William "Jimmy" Reihsnukks (May 18, 1943 â€“ January 15, 2017) was a Fijian semi-retired professional wrestler. He is better known by his ring name, Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka. His first match was in 1967. Snuka is one of the most remembered wrestlers, along with Hulk Hogan, Ted DiBiase, and more. His daughter Tamina Snuka currently works for the WWE. His son Jimmy Snuka, Jr. also worked for the company.

As of March 2013, he no longer wrestles although he still makes appearances now and again. In August 2015, his wife announced that Snuka was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

On September 1, 2015, Snuka was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the 1983 death of his girlfriend Nancy Argentino at an Allentown, Pennsylvania hotel. The charges were dismissed in 2017, because of Snuka's terminal illness and dementia. 

Snuka died of stomach cancer on January 15, 2017 in Pompano Beach, Florida, aged 74.
