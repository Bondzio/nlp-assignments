Humanâ€“computer interaction

Human-computer interaction (often shortened to HCI) is a field of computer science that looks at the ways in which a human uses a computer and interacts with it. The focus in human-computer interaction lies in the design of interactive systems, and in the interfaces with which the human interacts.
