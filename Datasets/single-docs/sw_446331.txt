Müllerian agenesis

Müllerian agenesis is a rare birth defect also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome or MRKH. People with the syndrome are born without vaginas, cervixes, and wombs, despite being biologically female. Queen Amalia of Greece had the syndrome. People with the syndrome cannot get pregnant because they do not have wombs.
