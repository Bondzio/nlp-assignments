USRC Active (1791)

USRC "Active" (1791) was one of the original ten cutters built and used by the United States Revenue Cutter Service. It was commissioned in 1792 and remained in service until 1800.

"Active" was built by the shipwright David Stodder in Baltimore, Maryland. She was designed as a schooner. She was rigged with fore-and-aft sails on two masts. She was launched on April 9, 1791 and was based in Baltimore. USRC "Active" was used to patrol the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. 

Her first master was Simon Gross. Her first mate was Isaac Roach and her second mate was Benjamin Rue. Goss resigned in 1792 and President George Washington promoted the former first mate, David Porter, as master. The 1791-built cutter named "Active" was sold in 1800.
