Kawauchi, Fukushima

Kawauchi was evacuated because of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. The village is 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. People had to leave their homes because of radiation. 

In 2012, the village government urged people to come back to their homes. In 2013, only 400 of the 2,000+ citizens of the village have decided to return.
