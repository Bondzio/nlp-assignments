Geneviève Bujold

Geneviève Bujold (born 1 July 1942) is a Canadian actress best known for her portrayal of Anne Boleyn in the 1969 movie "Anne of the Thousand Days".

Born in Montreal, Quebec, into a Catholic French Canadian working-class family, she received a strict convent education for twelve years before entering the Montreal's Conservatoire d'art dramatique, where she was trained in the great classics of French theatre. She made her stage debut as Rosine in Beaumarchais' "Le Barbier de Séville" in 1962.

She got her first major break in 1965, while on a theatrical tour in Paris, when she was noticed by French director Alain Resnais, who offered her a role in his movie "La guerre est finie", opposite Yves Montand. This led to her staying in France for a time and appearing in two other films; Philippe de Broca's "Le Roi de Coeur", opposite Alan Bates, and Louis Malle's "Le voleur", opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo.

Back in Canada, she married screenwriter/director/producer Paul Almond in 1967, and starred in three of his films; "Isabel" (1968), "The Act of the Heart" (1970) and "Journey" (1972), winning the Canadian Film Award for best actress for the first two. The couple divorced in 1973, but worked again together in "Final Assignment" (1980) and "The Dance Goes On" (1991), the latter also featuring their son Mathew Almond (born in 1968). 

She also appeared in Michel Brault's "Entre la mer et l'eau douce" (1967) and Claude Jutra's "Kamouraska" (1973), based on the novel by Anne Hebert, for which she won her third Canadian Film Award for best actress. 

She made notable appearances on American television (Hallmark Hall of Fame, NBC) in George Bernard Shaw's classic plays; "Saint Joan" in 1967, and "Caesar and Cleopatra" in 1976, the later opposite Sir Alec Guinness, as well as in Jean Anouilh's "Antigone" in 1974 (Great Performances, PBS). 

International recognition came in 1969, when she portrayed Anne Boleyn in Charles Jarrott's movie "Anne of the Thousand Days", opposite Richard Burton's Henry VIII. Her performance won her the Golden Globe Award for best actress in a leading role and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. The following year, she played Cassandra in Michael Cacoyannis's movie version of "The Trojan Women", opposite Katharine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave and Irene Papas.

Fluent in both French and English, she has since worked steadily in the United States, Canada and France. Notable movies have included; "Earthquake" (1974), "L'incorrigible" (1975), "Swashbuckler" (1976), "Obsession" (1976), "Another man, another chance" (1977), "Coma" (1978), "Murder by Decree" (1979), "Monsignor" (1982), "Tightrope" (1984), "Choose Me" (1984), "Dead Ringers" (1988), "The Moderns" (1988), "Les noces de papier" (1989), "Mon amie Max" (1994), "The House of Yes" (1997), "Eye of the Beholder" (1999), "Finding Home" (2003), etc.

In 1994, she made headlines when she was chosen to play the lead character in the popular television serie "", but quit after the first episode finding the shooting schedule too demanding. 

Geneviève Bujold lives in Malibu, California, since 1974 and is the mother of a second son Emmanuel (born in 1980) with companion Dennis Hastings.
