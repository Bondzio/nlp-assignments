I Write Sins Not Tragedies

"I Write Sins Not Tragedies" is the second single by the rock band Panic at the Disco, from their first album "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" (2005). It was released on April 27, 2006 on both compact disc and 7Â inch vinyl. Ryan Ross wrote the song. The edited version of the song with the lyrics "The poor groom's bride is a whore" and "Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?" were changed. "Whore" was replaced with a "shhh" sound and "God" was removed in "goddamn." It was ranked #3 in Billboard's Best 2000's Video poll.
