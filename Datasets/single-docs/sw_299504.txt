Seconal

Secobarbital sodium (sold as Seconal) is a drug which is used to treat epilepsy and insomnia. Trade names include Seconal and reds. It was first synthesised in 1928. Like other barbiturates, it is fairly addictive. In many countries, using this drug is illegal, outside the medical context. Today, this drug is only used rarely; Barbiturates have been replaced by Benzodiazepine for many applications.
