Count

A count is a nobleman in most of European countries, equivalent in rank to a British earl, whose wife is also still a "countess" (for lack of an Anglo-Saxon term). The word "count" comes from French "comte" which in turn comes from the Latin "comitas", "companion" (of the emperor).

A woman having this title or the wife of a count is called countess.
