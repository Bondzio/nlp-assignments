Sign of the cross

The sign of the cross is a physical gesture made by Catholics and other Christians. It is usually done at the beginning and ending of prayers. The right hand goes from the forehead, to the chest, to the left shoulder, and to the right shoulder. Or the right one could be the first. This is sometimes done while saying "Father, Son, Holy Spirit."
