Camilo Cienfuegos

Camilo Cienfuegos Gorriarán (; February 6, 1932 – October 28, 1959) was a Cuban revolutionary. He was born in Lawton, Havana. He was raised in an anarchist family that had left Spain before the Spanish Civil War. Cienfuegos became a key figure of the Cuban Revolution, along with Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Juan Almeida Bosque, and Raúl Castro.

On October 28, 1959, Cienfuegos's Cessna 310 ('FAR-53') disappeared over the ocean during a night flight from Camagüey to Havana. He was declared dead on the same day when searches for the plane failed. He was 27 years old.
