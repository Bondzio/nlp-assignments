WarioWare adds many new characters who are employees of Wario's company, WarioWare.



The series' first appearance in the "Super Smash Bros." series was in "Super Smash Bros. Melee", but it was only as a collectible trophy. In "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", Wario is a playable character, and can be in both his biker outfit from "WarioWare" or his plumber outfit from "Wario Land". There is also a level based on "WarioWare", collectible trophies and stickers from his series, and music from the "WarioWare" series. Masahiro Sakurai, the creator of the games, said that he did not include Wario in "Melee" because he did not like him, and picked Dr. Mario instead.
