Black Lives Matter

Black Lives Matter (BLM for short) is an international activist group. They originated in the African-American community. They are against violence and systemic racism toward black people. 

The movement began in 2013 with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin. They became famous for their street demonstrations, following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The earlier sparked riots and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. The latter sparked protests all over the United States.

Since the Ferguson protests, participants of Black Lives Matter have demonstrated against other African-Americans' deaths, like Freddie Gray, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDonald, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling.
