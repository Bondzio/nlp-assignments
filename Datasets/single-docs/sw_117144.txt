Kirby Super Star

Kirby Super Star, known in Europe as Kirby's Fun Pak and in Japan as is a platform video game made by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super NES game console. 

A remake called Kirby Super Star Ultra was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008.

There are six games so there are six plots. One is where you race King Dedede, one is where you fight a giant bird named Dyna Blade, another is where you fight King Dedede (note how one is racing, and another is fighting). One is where you hunt and try to destroy Meta Knight and his airship, Halberd. One is where you fight Marx and another is when Kirby is in a giant cavern and you obtain treasures.
