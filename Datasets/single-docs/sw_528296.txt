Lamborghini Huracán

The Lamborghini Huracán is a sportscar built by Lamborghini. It replaces the Lamborghini Gallardo. Lamborghini showed this car first at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show and Lamborghini builds it since 2014.

The name "Huracán" comes from the Spanish language. It means Hurricane. Huracán was also the name of a brave fighting bull. And the Mayan god of wind, storm and fire.

The LP610-4 is the base model of the Huracán. It is a coupe with two doors and two seats. The name "LP610-4" means that the car has a longitudinal mounted engine with 610 horsepower (449 kW) and Four-wheel drive.

The "'LP620-2" is a rear-wheel drive version of the LP610-4 coupé. It is built especially for the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo Series, a race series for Lamborghini only.

The LP610-4 Spyder is a convertible version of the LP610-4 coupé. It was first shown at the 2015 International Motor Show Germany in Frankfurt. It has the same engine as the LP610-4 coupé.

The LP580-2 is also a coupé on the basis of the LP610-4. But it only has 580 horsepower (427 kW) and only rear-wheel drive. Because of less power it is cheaper than the LP610-4 coupé.
