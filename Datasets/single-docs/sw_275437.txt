Gorgonopsid

The Gorgonopsids were Therapsids, a group of tetrapods which eventually gave rise to the mammals.

Gorgonopsids were a successful group which lived during the Permian period, about 260 million years ago. They became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event. 

They were the major predators of their day. They had large, powerful, square-shaped jaws with huge, sabre-like canine and interlaced, socket-like teeth. Many fossils have been found in South Africa.

The Gorgonopsidae are divided into three sub-families:
