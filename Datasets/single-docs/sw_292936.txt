Oreo

An Oreo is a cookie sandwich or cream biscuit. It is made by the Nabisco division of MondelÄ“z International. The cookie has a sweet, white filling of "creme" or "cream". The creme is in between two circle-shaped chocolate or golden cookie pieces.

Nearly 500 billion Oreos have been sold since they were first sold. This makes them the most bought U.S. brandname cookie in the 20th century.
