Oscar Niemeyer

Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho (December 15, 1907 December 5, 2012) was a Brazilian architect who is thought to be an important name in worldwide modern architecture. He was a pioneer in the idea of using reinforced concrete for buildings.

Buildings made by Niemeyer often have a lot of empty space, making odd patterns. The biggest work he made was the plan for the city of Bras√≠lia.

Politically, Niemeyer was a communist, which sometimes had a bad effect for him: When the military dictatorship of Brazil happened in 1964, Niemeyer was forced into exile in Paris. Fidel Castro once said "Niemeyer and I are the last Communists of this planet."

In 1988, Niemeyer won the Pritzker Prize.

In 2012, he died of cardiac arrest due to a respiratory infection.
