Miep Gies

Miep Gies, née Hermine Santrouschitz (born 15 February 1909; died 11 January 2010), was one of the Dutch citizens who hid Anne Frank and her family from the Nazis during World War II. She found and kept Anne's diary after Anne Frank was found and sent away by the Nazis. Although Gies did not read the diary (as she gave it to Otto Frank immediately after recovering it from the annexe and thought it would be rude to read), it has become very successful worldwide.

'I stand at the end of the long, long line of good Dutch people who did what I did or more – much more – during those dark and terrible times years ago, but always like yesterday in the hearts of those of us who bear witness. Never a day goes by that I do not think of what happened then.', Miep Gies stated on her own website.
