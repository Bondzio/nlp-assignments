Lovage

Lovage (Levisticum officinale) is a tall perennial plant.

Lovage leaves can be used in salads or to make soup, and the roots can be eaten as vegetable or grated for use in salads. Lovage seeds can be used as a spice. In the UK, lovage cordial was traditionally mixed with brandy as a winter drink.
