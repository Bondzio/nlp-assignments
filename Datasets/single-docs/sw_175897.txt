California State Route 99

State Route 99 (commonly known as Old Highway 99 or just 99, also named in the future as Interstate 7 or Interstate 9) is a state highway in California, in the United States. It is about long, running from north to south in the Central Valley. It is in parallel with Interstate 5. It begins at Interstate 5 near Wheeler Ridge, and continues north through the major cities of Bakersfield, Fresno, Chowchilla, Modesto, Stockon, Sacramento, Chico, and Red Bluff. Most of it is freeway, but some of it is still the historic rural two-lane road or a four-lane highway.
