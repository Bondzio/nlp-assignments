Dodge Caliber

Dodge Caliber is a compact hatchback sold from 2006-2011 by Chrysler. It was often categorized as a station wagon or a crossover (due to its limited AWD). The Caliber replaced the Neon. It was built on the Chrysler PM/MK platform which was also used on the Compass, Patriot, and Mitsubishi models as well. It was later replaced by the Dart (a badge engineered Alfa Romeo model).
