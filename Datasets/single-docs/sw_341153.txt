Hayabusa

The mission was a project of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of the University of Tokyo.

Hayabusa was sent into space on May 9, 2003. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid. The mission was successfully completed in June 2010 when the spacecraft returned to earth in June 2010.

"Hayabusa" studied Itokawa's shape, spin, topography, colour, composition, density, and history. The "Hayabusa" mission was the first time that an attempt was made to bring an asteroid dust sample to earth for analysis.

Three different feature-length films are being made about the Hayabusa mission.
