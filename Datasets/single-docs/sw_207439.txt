Zellers

Zellers was Canada's second-largest chain of mass merchandise department stores. The headquarters were in Brampton, Ontario. They had a mascot named "Zeddy", which is a teddy bear.

In 2011, the leaseholds of 189 Zellers stores were taken over by Target Corporation. Target got the leaseholds because they are expanding their stores into Canada in 2013 and 2014. HBC said most Zellers stores would close and retire the Zellers banner from Canadian retail by March 31, 2013.
