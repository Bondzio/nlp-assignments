Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry is a theory (commonly found in some forms of string theory) that says that when the universe formed, the same number of theoretical "superparticles" were created. If this theory is true, it would at least double the number of known particles in the universe. Supersymmetry may create more than one copy, since there are many dimensions (M-Theory by Edward Witten predicts up to 11). Many scientists believe in supersymmetry because it solves many inconsistencies in the Standard Model of physics. 

Supersymmetry was the idea of Hironari Miyazawa (b. 1927).
