List of counties of the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom has different sorts of counties. Some are traditional areas and some are for local government or other government things.

These counties are sometimes called "historic counties", "traditional counties" or "ancient or geographical counties". People argue about how much they exist in law. They are useful for genealogical and historic matters. Anyone may choose to use traditional counties or not.

The traditional counties have had nothing to do with government since 1889. However until 1974 most local government counties were very like them.

The United Kingdom has 92 traditional counties.

The areas used for local government are different in different parts of the United Kingdom. They have different names too.

Northern Ireland is one region and there are 26 districts within it. In parts of England there are local government counties with districts in them. In other parts there are counties with just one district, and in those parts there is only one council, which is the district council or the county council. Greater London is not a county; it has London Borough Councils, and a Greater London Authority. In Scotland there are "local government areas" but most people call them "council areas". In Wales there are "principal areas". Some councils' areas in Wales are called "counties" and others "county boroughs".

The Queen appoints officers called "lord-lieutenants". The areas in which they have their duties are usually called "ceremonial county", except in Scotland, where they are "lieutenancy areas". A lord-lieutenant and a high sheriff is appointed to each ceremonial county. In Scotland a lord-lieutenant only is appointed to each lieutenancy area.

A ceremonial county in England and Wales is a local government county or a group of local government counties. In Northern Ireland it is a county or county borough.
