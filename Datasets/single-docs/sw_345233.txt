Al-Hasa

Al-Ahsa, sometimes Al-Hasa, El Hasa, or Hadjar is a traditional oasis region in eastern Saudi Arabia. The oasis is about 60Â km inland from the Persian Gulf.

Al-Ahsa is part of the region known historically as Al-Bahrayn. It includes the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula down to the borders of Oman. It also includes the island of Awal (modern-day Bahrain).
Al-Hasa has one of the largest numbers of Shia Muslims in mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia.
