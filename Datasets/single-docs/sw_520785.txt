Francine Hughes

Francine Hughes (born August 1947) is an American woman who, after thirteen years of domestic abuse at the hands of her ex-husband named Mickey Hughes, killed her ex-husband, Mickey Hughes. She put fire to his bed on March 9, 1977. Mickey was killed and the house was destroyed in the fire. The story was made into a book and a movie. In No Child of Mine (where 35 year old Linda abused everyone), 35 year old Linda was acting like Mickey who lived with 13 year old Kerry (who didn't do anything wrong) in and for 13 years.

Hughes had suffered over a decade of beatings and verbal abuse from her husband. She divorced him but every time she tried to keep him out of the house he beat her. 

After Mickey was in a serious car accident she visited him in the hospital. She then allowed him back in the house to recover from his injuries. He started drinking and beating her again. 

On the day he died, he beat her badly then burned her textbooks for classes she was taking. That night Hughes poured gasoline on her husband's bed and set him on fire. She then drove to the police station so she could to the killing. After trial in Lansing, Michigan, Hughes was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. 

Francine Hughes' story was made into a book by Faith McNulty. It was later made into a movie in 1984 titled "The Burning Bed". It starred Farrah Fawcett.
