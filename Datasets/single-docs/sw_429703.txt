JTBC

JTBC is a South Korean nationwide general cable television network and broadcasting company. It was established on March 21, 2011 and launched on December 1, 2011. JTBC is supported by "JoongAng Ilbo", which is one of the three biggest newspapers published in Seoul. JTBC's largest shareholder is JoongAng Media Network with 25% of shares. JTBC's corporate identity (CI) is motivated by the rainbow, representing creativity and variety. JTBC is in alliance with other overseas broadcasting companies, including CNN, FOX, HBO, BBC, SMG, TV Asahi, K-channel, Al Masry, Al Youm and Standard Group.

JTBC insists Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) is ground for the return of "JoongAng Ilbo" to television in JTBC. TBC, which was a part of the Samsung Group, was launched in 1966 and ran the network for 16 years. In 1980, however, TBC was combined with the state-run Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) under the Chun Doo-hwan military regime. JTBC opened on December 1, 2011 to honor TBC, which was associated with KBS on November 30, 1980.
