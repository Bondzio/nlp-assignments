Coriaria nepalensis is a shrub growing in the foot hills of Himalayas. It blooms in spring and has beautiful yellow flowers and red fruits in summer.

In India, this plant is known in English as masuri berry, tanner's tree, mansur shrub; in Hindi as masuri, makola, masurya; in Nepali, macchaino.

It is a shrub, 1.5-2.5 metres tall. Flowers are in groups (inflorescences ) and they are male or female but in the same plant; their color is yellow. It blooms from February to May.

Fruits are red to dark purple when mature. They look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes) protected by enlarged and colored petals. Fruits are produced from May to August but they cannot be eaten because their seeds are poisonous.

The number of chromosomes is 40.
