British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven

The British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven or sometime British Aircraft Corporation 111 or also BAC 111 was a British airliner. It was a twin-turbojet that could carry around one hundred passengers. Some were built under licence in Romania as RomBAC 111. This aircraft is similar to the French Sud Aviation Caravelle and to the US Douglas DC-9. The One-Eleven was retired from service in the 1990s because of noise restrictions. It was one of the more successful British designed airliners.
