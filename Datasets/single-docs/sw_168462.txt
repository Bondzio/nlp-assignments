WrestleMania XXVI

WrestleMania XXVI is the twenty-sixth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event put on by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on March 28, 2010 at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

Global Spectrum, University of Phoenix Stadium's operator, had worked in past years with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to get the event to its venue. On January 18, 2008, Global Spectrum publicly announced that it wants to hold WrestleMania in 2010. The event became more widely known weeks prior when a photo of Wayne Gretzky wearing a shirt showing the event was seen in the Swedish newspaper "Expressen". A press conference happened on February 24, 2009 at the University of Phoenix Stadium to officially tell people about the event for Glendale, Arizona at the University of Phoenix Stadium; this event is the first time WrestleMania would happen in the state of Arizona. Tickets for the event went on sale November 7, 2009 at 10:00am MST. Advertisements telling people about the date tickets would go on sale used the song "Welcome to the World" by Kevin Rudolf.

Along with WrestleMania XXVI, a group of events known as "WrestleMania Week" was held in the week before the event. The third yearly "WrestleManiArt", an art show and auction featuring work by WWE superstars, was held on March 24. WrestleMania's yearly fan convention, "WrestleMania Axxess", was held from March 25 through to March 27. On March 27, WWE hosted its yearly WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the Dodge Theater, where the 2010 members were made an official member of the hall of fame.
