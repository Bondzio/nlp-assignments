Dave Bing

David Bing (born November 24, 1943) is an American businessman, retired basketball player, and former mayor. He was mayor of Detroit, Michigan from 2009 to 2013.

After starring at Syracuse University, Bing played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a guard for the Detroit Pistons (1966 to 1975), Washington Bullets (1975 to 1977) and Boston Celtics (1977â€“78). He is now in the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Bing entered Detroit politics as a Democrat in 2008. He announced his intentions to run for mayor in Detroit's non-partisan primary to finish the term of Kwame Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick had resigned during a corruption investigation. After winning the primary, Bing then defeated interim Mayor Kenneth Cockrel, Jr. and was sworn in as mayor in May 2009. Later that year, Bing was re-elected to a full term.
