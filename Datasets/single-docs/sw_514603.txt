Negev tortoise

The Negev tortoise (scientific name:"Testudo werneri") is a tortoise found mainly in the Negev desert in southern Israel. It was once present in the Sinai Peninsula but disappeared due to loss of habitat. In Israel it is protected by law and several conservation programs. It is currently considered a critically endangered species. The Negev is one of the world's smallest tortoises. Unlike other tortoises it does not hibernate in winter. Instead, winter is the breeding season. There is some disagreement over whether the Negev tortoise is the same species as the Kleinmann's tortoise. In 2010 the IUCN recommended that Israel take additional steps to protect the Negev tortoise including creating a wildlife preserve.
