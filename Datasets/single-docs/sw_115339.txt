Zelda II: The Adventure of Link

Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is an adventure-role-playing video game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System game console.

The main hero of the series, Link, finds out that Princess Zelda has gone under a deep sleep after a fight with a wizard. While trying to find crystals to awaken Zelda, Link also fights off followers of Ganon, who are trying to bring him back to life.

The gameplay of "The Adventure of Link" is very different from the rest of the series. It is a role-playing game where the player gains experience and levels up stats. The map is also different; the overworld is a birds-eye view, while smaller maps are side scrolling where the player moves only left and right.

Shigeru Miyamoto wanted to have a very different game than the first game, The Legend of Zelda. While Miyamoto was still the producer of the game, it was developed by new people than before. Instead of keeping a view from above, "Zelda II" has a side-view of the game when fighting enemies or exploring dungeons. The game was originally developed for the Famicom, but was released on worldwide systems after.
