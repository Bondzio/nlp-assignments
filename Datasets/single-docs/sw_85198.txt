Stamp collector

A stamp collector or philatelist collects postage stamps as a hobby. Stamp collectors normally keep the stamps in books called stamp albums. A philatelist can study various aspects of definitive stamps and other types of stamps, cancellations, and other philatelic materials.


There are many stamp collecting clubs around the world. Belonging to a stamp club or philatelic society has many advantages. For example, Royal Philatelic Society of Canada members receive magazines, can get help with questions through phone support, and purchase insurance for their collections at a discounted group rate.
