Planes (movie)

Planes is a 2013 American computer-animated movie. Unlike the "Cars" movies (which were produced by Pixar), "Planes" was produced by DisneyToon Studios. The movie is a spin-off to the "Cars" franchise, but it did not receive the kind of success that "Cars" received. "Planes" follows a crop-duster plane Dusty Crophopper who, under Skipper's training, becomes a racer in the Wings Around the Globe rally. With a lot of patience, Dusty has to face his racing rival Ripslinger as well as many other natural obstacles that come in his way. The movie was released on August 9, 2013. It had a sequel named "", which was released in 2014.
