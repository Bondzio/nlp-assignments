Jules Perrot

Jules-Joseph Perrot (18 August 1810 – 29 August 1892) was a French dancer and choreographer. Perrot was born in Lyon, France, and studied with Auguste Vestris. He debuted at the Paris Opéra in 1830, and became "premier sujet" (principal dancer) within a year. He became Carlotta Grisi's lover in 1836, and choreographed most of her role in "Giselle" in 1841. He passed six years creating ballets for Her Majesty's Theatre in London. He was appointed ballet master for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, and remained there until 1858. He returned to Paris, and retired in 1864, although he taught classes at the Opéra for many years. Perrot died on 29 August 1892. He created some of the most famous ballets of the 19th century including "Pas de Quatre", "La Esmeralda", "Ondine", and "Giselle".
