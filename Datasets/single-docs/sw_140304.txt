Dominion of Pakistan

The Dominion of Pakistan was an independent federal dominion in South Asia that was created in 1947 in the partition of British India into two sovereign dominions (the other being the Union of India).

The dominion included modern-day Pakistan (called West Pakistan) and Bangladesh (East Pakistan). It was supposed to be a homeland for the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent. It became the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956. The eastern part of the country became independent as the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971.
