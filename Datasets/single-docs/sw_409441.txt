Stevens–Johnson syndrome

Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a disease of the skin. In most cases, it is caused by an allergic reaction to drugs. This accounts for about half the cases. Lymphoma, and other infections are responsible for most other cases. The disease is characterized by cell death that causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis.
