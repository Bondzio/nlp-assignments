Humility Cooper

Humility Cooper (c. 1619 - prior to 1651) was a passenger on the ship "Mayflower" in 1620. She was born in Holland to Robert and Joan (Gresham) Cooper of Henlow, Bedfordshire, England about 1619. 

Cooper sailed to the New World with her uncle and aunt, Edward and Ann (Cooper) Tilley. The Tilleys died during their first winter in the New World.

Humility, and her aunt and uncle left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. John Tilley was a signer. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

Cooper received one acre of land when land was divided among the Pilgrims in 1623 She was included in the Edward Winslow family. She was also included in the Brewster family when the livestock were divided in 1627 so she lived with them for a time. 
In 1651 William Bradford wrote about her saying she "was sent for into England and there died". She was baptized in London on 17 March 1638 when she was aged 19. It is unknown whether she married or had children. Cooper died before 1651.
