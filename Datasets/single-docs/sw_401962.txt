Reginald Scot

Reginald Scot (ca. 1538-1599) was an English writer. He was born in Kent, England. He studied law, and served as a justice of the peace. His first book is "Perfect Platform of a Hop-Garden". This book is about growing hops. His second book is "The Discoverie of Witchcraft" (1584). This book takes a skeptical look at witches and witchcraft. It also exposes the tricks used by charlatans and magicians to fool people. Scot's purpose in writing the book was to prevent old, ill, and simple people from being charged with witchcraft. This book is important because it was one of the first to move away from medieval superstition in the Renaissance.
