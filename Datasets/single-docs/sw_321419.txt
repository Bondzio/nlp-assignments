Bitchū Province

The province had borders with Hōki, Mimasaka, Bizen, and Bingo Provinces.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Soja. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Bitchū Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Kibitsu jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Bitchū.
