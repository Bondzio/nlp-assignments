Troll (gay slang)

Troll and trolling are gay slang terms. Troll is used to characterize gay, bisexual and questioning or bi-curious men who cruise or "wander about looking" for sex or potential sex partners or experiences "in a notably wanton manner and with lessened standards of what one will accept in a partner." 

The term can be used positively or negatively depending on the speaker, usage, and intent. The term can describe the person or the activity. Although often referring to "an unattractive older gay man" and although troll as a slur "is primarily a visual, not a behavioral" judgment, the terms can be used for anyone who is "trolling" regardless of the putative troll's age or perceived beauty.
