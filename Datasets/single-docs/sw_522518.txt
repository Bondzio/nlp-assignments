Don't Disturb This Groove (album)

Don't Disturb This Groove is the fourth studio album recorded by American R&B/electropop band The System. Released by Atlantic Records in 1987, the album became a highlight of The System's career, as it has been the most commercially successful album, surpassing their hugely successful debut, "Sweat". It reached No. 62 on the "Billboard" 200 and No. 1 on the R&B Albums chart. The album was produced by its band members, David Frank and Mic Murphy.

Successful singles from this album include the band's first (and to date, only) top 10 hit on the pop charts with the contemporary R&B ballad title track, "Don't Disturb This Groove" and urban hit "Nighttime Lover".

Doug E. Fresh is featured on the track "House of Rhythm".
