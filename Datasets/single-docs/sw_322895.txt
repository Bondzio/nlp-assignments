Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness

Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness (also known as Kung Fu Panda: The Series and sometimes shortened to Legends of Awesomeness) is an American computer-animated television series based on the "Kung Fu Panda" movies. The series was originally set to air on Nickelodeon in 2010, but it was pushed back to 2011 instead. A total of 52 episodes have been produced or ordered. Two special previews were aired on September 19 and October 21, and it premiered on November 7, 2011.

While Lucy Liu and James Hong come back for the show, others didn't and were replaced by new members (for example, Mick Wingert is the new voice of Master Po, taking over from Po's original voice actor Jack Black).
