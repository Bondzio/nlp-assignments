Dalitstan.org

Dalitstan.org was a Dalit advocacy website active until mid-2006. It was one of 18 websites that were blocked by the Indian government following the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings.

The website claimed to be run by Dalitstan, a "Human Rights Organization working for the Upliftment of Dalits, the Untouchables of India". Note that -stan is a suffix for "place of" or "country", and forms part of the name of many places throughout Central and South Asia. Dalitstan would mean "place or country of the Dalits".

The website stated that the Dalits were the original people of India who created the Harappan civilization, and described the Brahmins as the descendants of the Aryan invaders who enslaved them.

Dibyesh Anand of the University of Westminster described Dalitstan.org as a Dalit nationalist group that also acted as a forum for anti-India Christian and Muslim advocacy.

Dalitistan.org was one of 18 websites that were blocked in India by the Ministry of Telecommunications of the Government in July 2006. The purpose of the block was to try to stop terror and hate messages on the Internet following the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings.

The website was started in 1999. The domain was registered by Helen Heklund, with an address in Granbury, Texas. The original version of the website was last archived on May 10, 2006. The domain registration lapsed (expired), and the rights to the name were then purchased by someone else.
