Exabyte

An exabyte (EB) is a unit of measurement for computers of the future. One exabyte holds 1000 petabytes (PB) or a million trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes. An exabyte is so large that it would take about one million powerful home computers to store this amount of data.

One thousand exabytes make one zettabyte.
