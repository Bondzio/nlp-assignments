Meessen De Clercq

Meessen De Clercq is a contemporary art gallery in Brussels, Belgium. The gallery is in an old building with three floors.
In 2007, art historian Olivier Meessen and art lover Jan De Clercq began to work to start a contemporary art gallery in Brussels. In April 2008 the gallery opened, with a group show of works by seven artists. After this first show, the gallery closed to rebuild it. From September 2008 the gallery re-opened with group and solo shows by both older and new artists.

Artists who show their work include:
