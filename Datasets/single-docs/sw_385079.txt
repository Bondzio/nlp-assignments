"Pokémon Black 2" and "White 2" play the same as previous games in the series. Unlike in "Black" and "White", players may now capture Pokémon from previous games from the start.

"Pokémon Black 2" and "White 2" follows a new Pokémon trainer who is on a journey to become a Pokémon master. They do this by catching and training Pokémon, and battling Pokémon trainers. It takes place in the Unova region two years after the events of "Black" and "White". During this time, there have been many changes. Changes include new areas to explore, new gym leaders, and new trainers to battle. There is also a new Team Plasma that was formed after the original team was defeated. The new Team Plasma aims to use Pokémon to take over Unova. During the player's journey, they will meet former members of the original Team Plasma. These members now use Pokémon for good, and help the player in their journey.
