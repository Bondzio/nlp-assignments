Venero Mangano

Venero Frank "Benny Eggs" Mangano (September 7, 1921 â€“ August 18, 2017) was an American criminal. He was the underboss of the Genovese crime family. Since boss Daniel "Danny the Lion" Leo was imprisoned in 2007, Mangano was the family's senior leader outside prison. The nickname "Benny Eggs" came from his mother running an egg farm. He was released from prison on November 2, 2006, after serving a 15-year sentence for extortion.

From 1978 to 1990, four of the five crime families of New York formed a cartel of window replacement companies. The cartel eventually controlled over $150 million in contracts from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).

As a member of the Genovese crime family, Mangano had a notable criminal record;

In 1997, while still in prison, Mangano was called to testify against boss Gigante. He refused to testify, saying, "What do you want to do, shoot me?" and "Shoot me, but I'm not going to answer any questions". He later took the witness stand, but refused to answer any questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights.

Mangano died of congestive heart failure in New York City on August 18, 2017 at the age of 95.
