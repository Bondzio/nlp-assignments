Goldsmith

A goldsmith is a person who makes objects using gold or other precious metals.

5,000 years ago, ancient Sumerians made bowls out of gold. People have long used gold for making jewelry or sacred objects used in religious worship. 

Goldsmiths use methods such as soldering, sawing, forging, casting, and polishing to make things out of gold. Goldsmiths traditionally teach their trade to apprentices. Today, jewelry arts schools teach goldsmithing and other similar skills.
