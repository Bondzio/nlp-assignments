Thalamus

The thalamus is a symmetrical structure in the brains of vertebrates. It is between the cerebral cortex and midbrain. 

It relays sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex, and regulates consciousness, sleep, and alertness. 

The thalamus sits above the hypothalamus, and below the cerebral cortex. It is a collection of nuclei with various functions. It acts as a relay station, gathering sense information of all kinds (except olfactory) and passes it on to the cerebral cortex. 

There are action systems for several types of behaviour, including eating, drinking, defecation, and copulation. These behaviours satisfy short-term needs, and are called 'consummatory' behaviours.
