Rupal Glacier

Rupal Glacier (or Tashain Glacier) is a glacier in the Great Himalaya subrange of the Himalayas. It starts in the north of an unnamed peak and flows northeast in the north of Laila Peak (Rupal Valley) and in the south of Nanga Parbat's many peaks. The melt water from the glacier forms Rupal River.
