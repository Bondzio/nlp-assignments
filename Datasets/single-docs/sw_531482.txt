Matricide

Matricide is the act of killing one's mother. In the case of teenage daughters, it is often for one of two reasons. Either the daughter "snapped" (suddenly lost her temper) after suffering abuse or became an abuser herself. Few studies have been done to discover why children commit parricide, matricide or patricide.
