Negombo

Negombo ( Tamil:நீர்கொழும்பு Sinhala: මීගමුව)is a city north of Colombo on the west coast of Sri Lanka. Bandranaike International Airport is here. Near the waterfront, the remains of a 17th-century Dutch Fort now houses a prison. Negombo Lagoon, lined with fishermen's huts, feeds into the Dutch-era Hamilton Canal. The canal leads south to Colombo. The neoclassical St Mary's church, completed in the 1920s, has a ceiling decorated with vivid religious paintings.
