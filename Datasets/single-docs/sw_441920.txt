Malaysia Airlines Flight 370

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370, also named under a codeshare agreement as China Southern Airlines Flight CZ748) is a missing Malaysia Airlines international passenger flight. The aircraft had 227 passengers and twelve crew members on board.

Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at 00:41 on 8 March 2014 (MST; UTC+8) for a scheduled six-hour flight to Beijing, China. Subang Air Traffic Control Centre lost contact with the plane at about 01:22, while over the Gulf of Thailand. It was reported missing at 02:40.

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating to see if terrorism is involved. Two passengers, one from Austria and another one from Italy, were named on the manifest. However, they were later discovered not to have been on board, their passports having been stolen. Meanwhile, Malaysian authorities are also ruling the identity of two other passengers to be false.

On 24 March 2014, officials with both Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government stated that while the aircraft's whereabouts were still not known, "unparalleled" analyses by the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and UK satellite company Inmarsat indicated that it had crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. It was presumed by these officials that all 239 people aboard died.

On 29 July 2015, a flaperon was found on a beach in Saint-André, on Réunion island. On 5 August, the Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak announced that the found flaperon was confirmed to be from flight MH370's aircraft.
