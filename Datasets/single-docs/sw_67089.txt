Meristem

A meristem is a tissue in plants made of dividing cells. They are in parts of the plant where growth can take place.

Plant cells which are differentiated generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells. This allows for the growth of tissues and new organs needed by the plant.

Meristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cells have for animals. They are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are capable of continued cell division.

The cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely small. The cytoplasm does not contain plastids (such as chloroplasts, but they are there in rudimentary form ('proplastids'). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities. The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall.

The apical meristem, or growing tip, is found in the buds and growing tips of roots in plants.

It begins growth of new cells in young seedlings at the tips of roots and shoots (forming buds, among other things). Specifically, an active apical meristem lays down a growing root or shoot behind itself, pushing itself forward. Apical meristems are very small, compared to the cylinder-shaped lateral meristems.

Apical meristems may differentiate into three kinds of primary meristem:

These meristems are responsible for primary growth, or an increase in length or height.

These meristems cause secondary growth, or an increase in width. There are two types of secondary meristems:
