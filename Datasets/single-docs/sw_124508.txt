Hypercube

In geometry a hypercube is a kind of multidimensional shape, like a square or a cube except that it has four dimensions or more.

A square is a two-dimensional shape, a cube has three dimensions. A cube is constructed by putting six squares together. Mathematicians say that the cube is the three-dimensional analogue of the square. The analogue of the square in an n-dimensional space is called hypercube. In four dimensions, this figure is also called tesseract.
