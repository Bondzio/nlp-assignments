List of Dalriadan monarchs

This is a list of monarchs who ruled Dalriada or Dál Riata, most reigns we are unsure of, so some reigns will be represented by their death and next to that a possible reign. All reigns from 726 are most likely true except Alpín I, Eógan and Indrechtach which we do not know the reign of.



Dalriada was ruled by possibly Pictish kings from 736-750, no kings are known during this period (after 741). There is also a possibility that it was a puppet state of Pictland ruled by some Pictish lords.


No-one knows the kings who rules Dalriada from the year 792-805 although Causatantín could have ruled during this time when he was king of the Picts.
