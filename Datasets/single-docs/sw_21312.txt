Jersey

Jersey is an island off the northwest coast of France. It is a crown dependency of the British monarchy. Jersey is called a "bailiwick" because the person who is the head of law for the island is called the "Bailiff". The Bailiwick of Jersey also includes the islands of the Minquiers and Ecréhous, where nobody lives. The other islands of the Channel Islands belong to the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The country code (also used for internet) is JE.

Over ninety-seven thousand people live on the main island. Thirty per cent of them live in its only town, Saint Helier.

Along with English and French, more than two thousand people speak Jèrriais, a dialectal form of the Norman language.

The Bailiwick of Jersey is not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union. It has its own parliament called the "States of Jersey" which passes laws for the island.

"Jersey" is divided into 12 parishes which elect their own administration.
