The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō

This was a popular subject. Hiroshige created many versions of this subject.

In 1832, Hiroshige traveled the length of the Tōkaidō from Edo to Kyoto. He was part of an official delegation from the court of the Tokugawa Shogunate to the court of the Emperor of Japan. 

In addition to the 53 stations, Hiroshige's series of images includes one print showing the departure from Edo. The series also includes a print showing the journey's end in the Imperial capital city.
