Himalayan Brown Bear

The Himalayan Brown Bear ("Ursus arctos isabellinus") is a subspecies of the Brown Bear. Himalayan Brown Bears are usually sandy or reddish-brown in colour. They are found in the foothills of the Himalaya and northern Pakistan, but are not found past Dachigam and Kashmir.

People also claim to have mistaken of what they thought was a Yeti (a Himalayan mythological ape-like creature) but was actually a Himalayan Brown Bear.
