Asian black bear

The Asian black bear ("Ursus thibetanus" or "Selenarctos thibetanus") is a medium-sized, sharp-clawed, black-colored bear with a distinctive white or cream "V" marking on its chest. It is also known as the Asiatic black bear, Tibetan black bear, the Himalayan black bear, or the Moon bear.

It is a close relative of the American black bear with which it is thought to share a European common ancestor. It is called 반달가슴곰 (bandalgaseumgom) in Korean. Both American and Asiatic species are thought of as sister taxa. They are more closely related to one another than any other species of bear.
