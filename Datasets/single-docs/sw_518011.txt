American Oxygen

"American Oxygen" is a song recorded by Rihanna. It was supposed to be from her eighth studio album "Anti" (2010), but the song was later released by itself. It was written by Alex da Kid, Candice Pillay, Sam Harris and Rihanna; Alex da Kid and Kanye West produced it.

The writing of the song began in 2014, and it continued into 2015. Sam Harris who wrote the song felt that Rihanna would be good to sing it as she originally was a black female immigrant in America. He was also "choked up" when he heard Rihanna sing it as he idolized her.
