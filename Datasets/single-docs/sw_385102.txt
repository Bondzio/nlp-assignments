Child abuse (skin signs)

Injuries to the skin are one of the most common signs that a child is being physically abused. These injuries may be in the form of burns and bruises. Injuries which are done on purpose usually are found on certain parts of the body, and often have patterns and shapes that are different than injuries that happen by accident. Knowing how to tell the difference between injuries that happen by accident and injuries that are done to a child on purpose is an important part of helping to protect children from harm.
