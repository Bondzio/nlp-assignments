Tzitzernavank Monastery

Tzitzernavank Monastery (, "Swallows Monastery") is an Armenian monastery in the region of Kashatagh (under control of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic). The monastery dates from the fourth to sixth centuries and recognized as a native Armenian example of an “oriental” architectural type.

The church of St. Gregory was reopened after a restoration in 1999-2000.
