A Clockwork Orange (movie)

A Clockwork Orange is a 1971 British crime drama movie. It was written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. It is based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 short novel "A Clockwork Orange". It includes disturbing, violent images. Its social commentary touches on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian vision of a not-too-future Britain.

Kubrick stopped the film being shown in Britain, concerned about its possible effects. For 27 years it was difficult to see the film in the United Kingdom. It reappeared in cinemas, and the VHS and DVD releases followed, soon after Kubrick's death in 1999.
