Polydor Records

Polydor Records is a record label currently based in the UK, and is a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. 

Though Polydor's American branch is gone, in the United Kingdom, however, Polydor continues to sign chart-topping acts and remains one of the strongest imprints in the country â€” with artists such as Klaxons, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Take That and Kaiser Chiefs. It also acts as the UK label for American-based acts under Interscope-Geffen-A&M like Eminem and Gwen Stefani.

In spring 2006, Polydor launched Fascination Records, a music label dedicated to pop music. Both Girls Aloud and Sophie Ellis-Bextor transferred to the new label.
