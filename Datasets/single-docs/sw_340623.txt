Shrines and Temples of Nikkō

The site covers 103 buildings or structures and the natural area around them. Two Shinto shrines and one Buddhist temple are included in the site. 

The area of Nikko has been a Shinto forest since pre-historic times. It has had Buddhist temples since the 9th century. Thousands of Japanese cedars were planted in the early 17th century

The shrines and temples of Nikkō are closely related to the history of the Tokugawa Shoguns. 

In 1871, the Shinto areas and Buddhist areas were separated. Three sites were identified -- two Shinto shrine complexes and one Buddhist temple complex. 

After the "Law on the Preservation of Shrines and Temples" in 1897, Nikkō was protected by the Japanese government. 
Nikkō's shrines and temples were named a World Heritage Site in 1999.




In 2012, the World Heritage Site covers nine National Treasures of Japan and many "Important Cultural Properties".

Many gates and buildings at Nikkō have very detailed carvings. The use of color is based on records dating back to 1753. The very precise descriptions of the architectural structures
and the decorative works are used by experts who want to preserve history at Nikkō.
