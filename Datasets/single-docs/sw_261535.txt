Elimination Chamber (2010)

Elimination Chamber (also known as No Way Out in Germany) was a pro wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on February 21, 2010 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It replaced No Way Out as WWE's February pay-per-view.

The idea of the show was that the two main event matches, one for the World Heavyweight Championship and one for the WWE Championship, would be in an Elimination Chamber. Each match had six wrestler in it: the defending champion and five challengers. Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Randy Orton, John Cena, and Kofi Kingston in the Raw Elimination Chamber. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and R-Truth. On the undercard, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter, and Maryse and Gail Kim wrestled against Team Lay-Cool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in a tag team match.
