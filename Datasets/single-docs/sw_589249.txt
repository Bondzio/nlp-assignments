Brazilian National Anthem

The Brazilian National Anthem (in Portuguese: "Hino Nacional Brasileiro") is the national anthem used in Brazil. 

The music was composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva between 1822 and 1831. It was officially adopted as the country's national anthem in 1831. The lyrics to the anthem were written by Os√≥rio Duque-Estrada in 1909. They became official in 1922, with some changes.
