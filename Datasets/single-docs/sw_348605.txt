Japanese calligraphy

Japanese Calligraphy started with introduction of Kanji from China.

At first, Japanese didin't use Kanji. But after Buddhism was introduced into Japan, Japanese Calligraphy spread rapidly.

Emperors such as Shotokutaishi ("聖徳太子") and Shoumu ("聖武天皇")　advanced hand-copied sutras. Also, Japanese envoys to Tang Dynasty China took Chinese culture back to Japan. This affected the way of Japanese Calligraphy.

There are two systems of letters in Japan. They are Kana and Kanji characters ().

In Japan, calligraphy was a way of writing, so it was closely related with people's life.
