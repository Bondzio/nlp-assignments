Constitutional republic

A constitutional republic is a state in which the head of state and other officials are representatives of the people. They must govern within an existing constitution.

In a constitutional republic, executive, legislative, and judicial powers may be separated into distinct branches.

In simpler words: Constitutional Republic is when people elect someone to represent them. It limits the government’s power over the citizens. In a way, the power is split apart or separated between the citizens and the government.

A state is constitutional if a constitution limits the government's power. If the people choose by election the head(s) of state and other officials, then the state is a republic. The United States of America and Republic of Iceland are examples of constitutional republics. 

In practice, the term is not so clear. There are republics with constitutions which the head of state can ignore. There are democratic monarchies which have unwritten constitutions, and where the monarch is not the head of government. One element which varies greatly is the nature of the election system.
