Anarkali Bazaar

Anarkali Bazaar or Anarkali Market is an old style market in Lahore, Pakistan.

The word 'Anarkali' means 'Pomegranate Blossom'. According to a legend this was the name of a beautiful dancing-girl who fell in love with the Mughal prince Selim (who later became the Emperor Jahangir). But the prince's father, the old Emperor Akbar, did not like this and he had the girl arrested and punished. She died and was buried near this bazaar or market. Later, when her lover Jahangir became Emperor he named this place after her. Today, there is still an old tomb near there, which was built by Jahangir in 1615, and people say this is the tomb of the real Anarkali, but this is not sure. Another famous tomb near Anarkali market is that of the Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aibak.

Today, the Anarkali bazaar or market is one of the best shopping areas in all of South Asia. Women especially love to go there, because it has excellent clothes, shoes and jewellry shops. There are some nice places to eat, there, too. It is open most days, and from 9 in the morning to 11 at night. There are always many lights and music playing there, and also a lot of traffic.
