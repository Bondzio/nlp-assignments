Hochvogel

The Hochvogel is a high mountain in the Allg√§u Alps. The border between Germany and Austria runs over the summit. Climbers can ascend the summit on two marked routes. One of the most interesting climbs is by Hermann von Barth. He stayed overnight at the summit in 1869. On 14 December 1945 an American Flying Fortress crashed on the west of the Hochvogel .
