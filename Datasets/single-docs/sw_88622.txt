Babi Yar

Babi Yar () is a ravine near Kiev in Ukraine.

During the Holocaust, Nazi soldiers massacred 33,771 Jewish people at Babi Yar. This may have been the worst two-day mass murder of Jews in all of the Holocaust.

Nazi Germany and other Axis countries occupied Kiev on September 19, 1941. By September 26, the military governor and the "Schutzstaffel" (SS) and Police Leader had decided to kill all of the Jews in Kiev. They said this would be revenge for German soldiers being attacked by some Jewish guerrilla fighters.

The Nazis tricked the Jews into coming to Babi Yar by telling them they were going to be sent to another place to live. On 28 September 1941, they put up an order in the town. Part of it said:

Later, one of the soldiers in charge of the massacre would say:
On September 29 and 30, special units of the SS called "Einsatzgruppen", and some local Ukrainians who supported the Nazis, took these people to the ravine at Babi Yar. They made them put all of their things in piles. They made them strip naked. The area was so crowded that by the time people heard gunshots, there was no way to escape. The Nazis took people ten at a time into the ravine, made them lay down, and shot them with machine guns.

Between September 29 and 30, the Nazis killed 33,771 Jewish people at Babi Yar.

The Nazis buried these people in a mass grave. People who had survived being shot were buried alive, along with the dead. Only 29 people survived and were able to escape.

The murdered Jews' property was given to Nazi leaders in Kiev.
