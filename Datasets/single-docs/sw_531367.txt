Bad Aibling rail accident

The Bad Aibling rail accident was an accident that happened on the railway line in Bad Aibling in Bavaria, Germany, on 9 February 2016. Eleven people were killed and many more injured when two trains collided head-on, along a single-track line. 

The accident happened on a section of the line with only one track. The line is equipped with a security system which should have prevented the accident. It is currently unclear if the accident occurred because of a system malfunction or because of human error.

At the current state of research, an error of the train drivers or a signal malfunction look unlikely.
