Zinc sulfide

Zinc sulfide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ZnS. It contains zinc and sulfide ions.

Zinc sulfide is white when pure. It does not dissolve in water. It can burn at a high temperature to make sulfur dioxide and zinc oxide. It reacts with strong acids to make hydrogen sulfide. 

Zinc sulfide can be made by igniting a mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur. Another way of making it is to react hydrogen sulfide with a zinc compound.

Zinc sulfide is used to convert ultraviolet light to visible light. It can be doped with copper to make it glow in the dark.
