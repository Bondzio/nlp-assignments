Lahore Museum

The Lahore Museum or Ajaib Ghar (Urdu: Wonder House) is a museum in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. It is the largest and best museum in the country.
The original old Lahore Museum was made during British Indian times in the 1860s, in what had been the old 'Punjab Exhibition Hall' and the famous gun Zam Zama was installed outside it in 1870. This old museum, along with the Punjab School of Arts (later the Mayo College of Arts) was looked after by John Lockwood Kipling (1837-1911) father of the writer Rudyard Kipling, who mentioned the museum and Zam Zama in his "Kim (book)" (1901). In 1894, the museum's 'new' building was completed and it shifted there the same year, right opposite the old campus of the University of the Punjab, on the Mall.

At present, the Lahore Museum is set in its beautiful grounds and has one of the best collections of arts and artifacts in its galleries in South Asia. Especially notable are: (a) its ancient Gandhara Buddhist sculptures (b) its Tibetan and Hill States collection (c) its famed collection of miniature paintings from the Mughal Empire and the "Pahari" school and (d) its excellent collection of contemporary paintings by some of Pakistan's most prominent artists such as Ustad Allah Bux, A.R. Chughtai, Shakir Ali, Sadequain, Gulgee and others.
