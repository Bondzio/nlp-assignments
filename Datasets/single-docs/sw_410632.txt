Australian of the Year

The Australian of the Year is an award presented on Australia Day (26 January) every year to an important Australian. The awards began in 1960 and are supported by the Australian government and several major companies. The awards are given by the National Australia Day Council. Over the years it has grown to include the Young Australian of the Year and the Senior Australian of the Year. An award to honor people at a local community level has also been developed as the Asutralian Local Hero. The first Australian of the Year was Nobel Prize winner, Sir Macfarlane Burnet.
