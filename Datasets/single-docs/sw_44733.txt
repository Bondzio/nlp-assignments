Namaste

Namaste is a greeting used a lot in many East Asian countries. It is used when both Hello and Goodbye would be used in English, though it has a very different meaning.

Namaste is kind of like a praise to the person receiving the namaste.

The word's meaning is “I bow to the divine in you.” Namaste is a traditional Indian greeting of respect and thank you, with spiritual and symbol meaning.
