Scott Weiland

Scott Weiland (born Scott Richard Kline; October 27, 1967 â€“ December 3, 2015) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. His career lasted three decades. He was best known as the lead singer for the rock band Stone Temple Pilots from when they formed in 1986 until he was fired in 2013. He was also the lead singer of band Velvet Revolver from 2003 to 2008. That band had members from another popular band, Guns N' Roses, and were called a "supergroup" because of this. 

Weiland was born in San Jose, California. At age five, he was adopted by his stepfather and moved to Ohio. Weiland moved back to California in his teens.

After he was fired from Stone Temple Pilots, Weiland formed a solo band called the Wildabouts. They released an album in March 2015 called "Blaster" but their guitar player, Jeremy Brown, died the day before it came out. Weiland himself died on this band's tour bus in Bloomington, Minnesota on December 3, 2015 after drinking and taking drugs such as cocaine. He was 48 years old. He had battled addictions to drugs for over 20 years, at first becoming addicted to heroin in the 1990s.
