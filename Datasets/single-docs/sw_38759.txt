Anna Politkovskaya

Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya (; 30 August 1958 — 7 October 2006) was a Russian journalist. Anna Politkovskaya wrote for the newspaper "Novaya Gazeta". She was born in the New York City, United States. Her parents were diplomats. Her birth name was Anna Stepanovna Mazepa (Russian:"Анна Степановна Мазепа").

She was best known for her thoughts about the war in Chechnya, a Russian state. She was also against the current leader of Russia, president Vladimir Putin. Many of her texts asked for human rights.

In 2002 Politkovskaya won the Courage in Journalism Award.

On 7 October 2006, she was shot dead at her house in Moscow. It is possible she was murdered for political reasons. Some Western countries have asked for a thorough investigation of her death. They see it as an attempt to end opposition to the current Russian regime, as perhaps one of the last chances to save the freedom of the press in Russia. The "Noyava Gazeta" has put up a reward for information that can explain why she was killed.
