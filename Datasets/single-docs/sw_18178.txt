Googol

A googol is the number 10 .

The word googol was first used by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner. Sirotta made this word in 1938, for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. It is said that the word "googol" was chosen to represent this number because it sounded like baby talk.

The company Google was named after the number "googol". It was named this because it was said that not only did "google" sound like "googol", but Google had a googol search results.
