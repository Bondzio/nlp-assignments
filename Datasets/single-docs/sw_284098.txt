Arnold Bennett

Enoch Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 â€“ 27 March 1931) was an English novelist.

He started as a journalist, and during World War I was in charge of propaganda in France.

Bennett was born in Hanley in the Potteries district of Staffordshire, and his best known books were about life in this area. He changed the names of the five towns in the district, but their names are easy to recognise.

When in London, Bennett liked to eat at the Savoy Hotel's Grill. He often ate an omelette made with smoked haddock, and this has become known as the Omelette Arnold Bennett. The Omelette Arnold Bennett has remained a Savoy standard dish ever since.
