Eoabelisaurus

Eoabelisaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic period of what is now South America. It was a bipedal carnivore that probably reached in length.

The discovery, which is fairly recent, is important because of its relative completeness. It is the earliest known member of the family Abelisauridae.
