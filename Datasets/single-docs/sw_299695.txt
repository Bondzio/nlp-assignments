A Roman fort was built on St Andrew's Hill above the town. This was later replaced by a second fort. Pottery which was made between 50 and 70 AD was found in the field where the forts were. Some more pottery was found in the middle of Cullompton. This was not as old as the pottery from the fort and was made in the second and third centuries.

The first written record of Cullompton is in the will of the English King Alfred the Great.
