J. Edgar Hoover

John Edgar Hoover (January 1, 1895 â€“ May 2, 1972) was an American politician. He was the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States. He was chosen as director of the Bureau of Investigation because he helped start it. He was the director until his death in 1972 at age 77.

According to President Harry S Truman, Hoover transformed the FBI into his private secret police force. Truman stated that "we want no Gestapo or secret police. FBI is tending in that direction. They are dabbling in sex-life scandals and plain blackmail. J. Edgar Hoover would give his right eye to take over, and all congressmen and senators are afraid of him".

Hoover had the largest collection of pornography in history. Some adult movies included photos of Joan Crawford, Frank Sinatra, Warren Beatty, and Tony Curtis.

Hoover was born on January 1, 1895 to a Swiss-German-English-American family in Washington, D.C. He studied at George Washington University. Hoover was homosexual.

It is unknown if Hoover and his political partner Clyde Tolson were ever in a relationship. Hoover died on May 2, 1972 in Washington, D.C. from heart failure, aged 77.
