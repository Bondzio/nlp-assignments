Hyperacusis

Hyperacusis is a hearing health problem where people become more sensitive to some sounds for certain frequencies and volumes. This can make everyday sounds such as a car, dishwasher or refrigerator sound very loud. It is usually very difficult to tolerate and can be uncomfortable or even painful for people experiencing it. 

The increasing sensitivity of the ears caused by hyperacusis is usually painful for many people. Not only can it negatively effect the everyday lives of people experiencing it, it can for some make it very difficult and even not possible to do their everyday jobs and take care of their responsibilities. There are many symptoms experienced by those with hyperacusis. 

Similarly to other hearing problems, hyperacusis can occur suddenly or gradually over time and is a problem that can affect people of all different ages in one or both ears. Again, like other forms of hearing problems, there are a variety of possible causes ranging from exposure to noise and other diseases.

Although these are the main causes of hyeracusis and can be seen as causes related to most hearing problems, there are other less common, possible causes such as post-traumatic stress disorder. 

Hypercusis does not have any real cure or treatment options specifically aimed at it. Although damage to the ear should be avoided by taking the proper precautions such as using hearing protection there are ways that can help to manage hyperacusis.
