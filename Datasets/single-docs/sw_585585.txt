Bohai Sea

The Bohai Sea () is a gulf on the northeast coast of China and it is west of the Korean Peninsula. It is a redundant place name, which mean that the words making up the place name has the same meaning, since "hăi" (海) as in "Bóhǎi" already means "sea" or "ocean". Some important port cities on the Bohai Sea coast include Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Dalian.
