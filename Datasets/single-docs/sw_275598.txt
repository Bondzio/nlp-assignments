The Wild Bunch (sound system)

The Wild Bunch were a sound system based in the St Pauls area of Bristol, England from 1983 to 1986. The group was known for playing sets that drew large crowds on the club scene and had performed shows as far away as London. They performed in soundclashes against other Bristol sound systems. The Wild Bunch's sound used a lot of different musical styles - an unusual thing at the time. Their shows included parts of punk, R&B and reggae, with a use on slower rhythms and ambient electronic music that would become a start of the Bristol sound, more popularly known as trip-hop. They were a key member of what became the Bristol underground scene.

The Wild Bunch is perhaps best known for having been the first group of several notable British DJs and performers:
