Celtiberian Range

Celtiberian Range (in Spanish language: "Serranía Celtibérica"), also named: South Lapland or Spanish Lapland ("Laponia del Sur" or "Laponia Española") is the geographical term that receives a tiny fraction of the Spanish territory due to its lower population and lacking of infraestructures.

Its nomenclature comes from the Celtiberian, a pre-Roman tribe who lived in that area long time ago.

It comprises an area of 63,098 km². Through the range are 1,632 municipalities among several provinces. All but Valencian Community are landlocked.

It has a population of 503,566 inhabitants.
