Bacteriology

Bacteriology is the study of bacteria. Bacteriologists study, identify, classify, and describe bacterial species. 

Microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses are studied by "microbiologists". However, bacteriology is a distinct science, because the make-up and inheritance of bacteria is rather different from the other groups.
