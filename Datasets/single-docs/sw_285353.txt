Australia Day

Australia Day is a public holiday held each year in Australia. It is celebrated on the 26 January. It is used to remember the day that the First Fleet entered Australia in 1788. On 26 January 1788 British people entered the country at Sydney Cove and made it their new homeland.

Some people do not like this day being celebrated. For example, some indigenous Australians call it "Invasion Day" or "Survival Day" because it was the day that their native land was invaded. Some people have suggested that the date should be changed but most people do not have the same opinion.

On 13 May 1787, 11 ships were sent from Great Britain to Australia. The ships carried mostly prisoners to Australia where many were going to be living the rest of their lives. The ships were led by Captain Arthur Phillip, who was later promoted to an Admiral.
