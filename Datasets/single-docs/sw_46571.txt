Voyager 1

Voyager 1 is a spacecraft used by NASA to explore Jupiter and Saturn. It is identical in form to its sister ship, Voyager 2. It was actually sent to study the outer planets of the Solar System, but is now in an extended mission.

Voyager 1 is now out of the Solar System. Its research team announced the exit on 25 August 2012. Voyager 1 has already reached interstellar space after going through the final area which was a magnetic field.

Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977.

Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 include the Voyager Golden Record, which is a recording of sounds and images of life on earth. The sounds are almost out of all languages spoken in Earth. It was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.
