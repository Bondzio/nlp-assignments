Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden

Gustav II Adolf (9 December 1594 – 6 November 1632, O.S.) was the King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632. He is known in English as Gustavus Adolphus.

Gustavus Adolphus was born in Stockholm. His parents were Charles IX of Sweden and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. When his father died in October 1611, Gustavus became King of Sweden.

Gustavus married Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. Their daughter Christina later became Queen of Sweden.

Gustavus died in the Battle of Lützen in 1632.

Gustavus Adolphus Day is on 6 November. Every year it is celebrated in Sweden, Estonia and Finland. On this day only, a special pastry is sold that has a chocolate or marzipan medallion of the king.
