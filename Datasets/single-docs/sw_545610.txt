New York Tribune

The New-York Tribune was an American newspaper. It was founded by Horace Greeley as a Whig Party penny newspaper in April 1841. Between 1842 and 1866, the newspaper was called the New-York Daily Tribune. The tribune not only reported the news, it covered subjects such as politics, literary works, social reform and intellectual achievements. Greeley, through the Tribune, supported the beginnings of Republican Party. In 1860 the "Tribune" supported Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States and during the Civil War. However, the paper opposed his reelection in 1864. For some time the paper had the largest circulation in the United States. The "Tribune's" editorials were widely read and helped shape national opinion. In 1924 it was merged with the "New York Herald" to form the "New York Herald Tribune". It remained a major US daily newspaper until it ended publication in 1966.
