Ali Bongo Ondimba

Ali Bongo Ondimba (born Alain Bernard Bongo; February 9, 1959) is a Gabonese politician. He became President of Gabon on October 2009.

Ondimba's father Omar Bongo was the first President of an independent Gabon, and he took over from his father when the elder Bongo died in 2009. Bongo was involved in his father's government. When he took over as president, he promised to reduce the size of government to save money. Bongo has been criticized both being undemocratic and for profiting from Gabon's oil wealth while the Gabonese people remain poor. In response to this in 2015, Bongo announced he would donate his the money he received from his father to charity.
