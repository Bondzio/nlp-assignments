Totalitarianism

Totalitarianism is a word used to describe modern regimes (political systems) where the government controls all public behaviour and as much of private behaviour as they can. It often involves mass participation in events such as parades or rallies.

This idea was mainly used in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The satire "Nineteen Eighty-Four" by George Orwell was about such a society taken to extremes.
