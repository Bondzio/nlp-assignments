Shizuka Gozen

Shizuka Gozen (1165–1211), or Lady Shizuka, was one of the most famous women in Japanese history and literature. She was a "shirabyōshi" (court dancer) of the 12th century, and a mistress of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Since she, like many others, are featured largely in the Heike Monogatari (Tale of Heike), Gikeiki (Chronicle of Yoshitsune), and a number of plays of various traditions, her story is quite well known, but it is difficult to separate fact from fiction within it.
