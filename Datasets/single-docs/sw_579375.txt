It (novel)

It is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. The story follows the lives of seven children as they are terrorized by the demonic clown being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. "It" primarily appears in the form of a clown in order to attract its preferred prey of young children. 

The novel is told through narratives alternating between two time periods, and is largely told in the third-person mode. "It" deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma, and the ugliness lurking behind a traditional small-town values. 

The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year. "Publishers Weekly" listed "It" as the best-selling book in the United States in 1986.

Popular versions of the novel have been made from a 1990 miniseries and a 2017 horror movie.
