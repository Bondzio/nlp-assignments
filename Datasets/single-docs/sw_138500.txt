Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!

Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is the first studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. The album was released on June 12, 1985. It was released through Combat Records. 

Early in 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat Records to record and produce the band's first album. The money proved not to be enough and the band was given $4,000 more. Most of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, which forced the group to fire their original producer and produce the record by themselves.
