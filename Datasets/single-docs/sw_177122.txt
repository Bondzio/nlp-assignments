The Attitude Era

The Attitude Era was a period in the World Wrestling Federation and professional wrestling history. It began with the Monday Night Wars and reached its end with the conclusion of the Wars in 2001. The Attitude Era professional, like the 1980s wrestling boom, made wrestling more popular in the United States from the late 1990s to early 2000s. Television ratings and pay-per-view buy-rates reached their highest points. Unlike the more traditional WWF programming, the Attitude Era tried to attract the young adult demographic. It did this by transforming the product into a more controversial "shock value" form of entertainment similar to the "Trash TV" genre popularized in the 1990s.
