J. Michael Bishop

John Michael Bishop (born February 22, 1936) is an American immunologist and microbiologist. He shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Harold Varmus and was co-winner of 1984 Alfred P. Sloan Prize. He currently serves as an active faculty member at the University of California, San Francisco.

Bishop is best known for his Nobel-winning work on retroviral oncogenes. Working with Varmus in the 1980s, he discovered the first human oncogene, c-Src. 

Their findings showed how malignant tumors are formed from changes to the normal genes of a cell. These changes can be produced by viruses, by radiation, or by exposure to some chemicals.
