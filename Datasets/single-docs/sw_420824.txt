Prayer in Christianity

Prayer in Christianity is seen by most Christians as a way of communicating with God. Prayer is seen as being therapeutic by many Christian leaders. 
The Lord's Prayer, which Jesus taught his disciples, was important as an example in the early churches. The prayers in the Old Testament and New Testament have also influenced Christian thought.
