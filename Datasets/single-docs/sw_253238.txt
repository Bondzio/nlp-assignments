Flag of Minnesota

The Flag of Minnesota is the state seal on a blue background. The flag that people use now was made in 1957 and the state seal on the flag was changed in 1983. In the past, people used a different flag that looked like the one that Minnesota uses now, but it had different colors on the front and back of the flag. Some people don't like the flag because they think it is too complicated and they think it should be simpler.
