Ostreoida

The order Ostreoida includes the oysters and other families of bivalves such as Pectinidae (mostly scallops). 

In 2010, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published by Bieler, Carter & Coan, revising the classification of the Bivalvia, including the order Ostreoida.
