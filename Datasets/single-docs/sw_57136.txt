The Cask of Amontillado

"The Cask of Amontillado" (sometimes spelled "The Casque of Amontillado") is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in "Godey's Lady's Book" in November 1846.

A man named Montresor wants to take revenge on Fortunato, though his motivation is not clear. It is during a masquerade in the city. Fortunato is dressed in a jester's costume. Montresor tells Fortunato he has bought a special rare wine called amontillado. He wants Fortunato to test it to be sure it is real. Montresor leads Fortunato into an underground tunnel to test the wine. He walls him up alive in a niche.
