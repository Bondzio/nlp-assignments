Betsy Ross

Betsy Ross (January 1, 1752 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania â€“ January 30, 1836 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), born Elizabeth Griscom and also known by her second and third married names Elizabeth Ashburn and Elizabeth Claypoole, is widely known as making the first American flag. There is, however, no evidence that the story is true.
