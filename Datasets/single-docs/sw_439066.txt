Lateral spinothalamic tract

The lateral spinothalamic tract (or lateral spinothalamic fasciculus), is a part of the Anterolateral system. It is a bundle of long, thin, sensory axons. These axons carry sensory information, like pain and temperature, through the spinal cord to the brain. This information is received in the thalamus of the brain.
