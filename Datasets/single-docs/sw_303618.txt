The United States lost to Japan in the finals, so United States finishes as runner-up (for the first time). They also beat Brazil, which had beaten them in the semifinals of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.

The United States won their second title on this year. After they defeated China 5-4 in the penalty kicks, a lot more people began to watch Women's football. Also, after Brandi Chastain made the last penalty, she randomly slid on the grass and ripped of her shirt. This brought a lot of attention, but Brandi Chastain said "Momentary insanity, nothing more, nothing less. I wasn’t thinking about anything. I thought, ‘This is the greatest moment of my life on the soccer field."

The United States won their first title on this year. They defeated Norway 2-1.

The U.S. women's team boasts the first six players in the history of the sport to have appeared 200 times for their national team. One of them, Kristine Lilly, is the only player of either sex with 300 or more appearances.
