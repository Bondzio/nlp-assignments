Solvay process

The Solvay process is a way to make sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate. It is essentially the reaction of carbon dioxide with ammonia and sodium chloride to produce ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate may be heated to produce sodium carbonate.The process consists of saturation of cold, concentrated solution of sodium chloride with ammonia.
