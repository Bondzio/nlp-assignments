Fraggle Rock

Fraggle Rock is a British/American/Canadian children's live action puppet television series. It was created by Jim Henson. Fraggle Rock is about a society of Muppet creatures called Fraggles. It was shown from 1983-1987. Down at Fraggle Rock (Down in Fraggle Rock) is an opening and ending song. In 1993 versions of some episodes, at the end of some scenes, the 1993 Fraggle Rock "Stay tuned" screen/logo replaced the 1982-1987 Fraggle Rock ending credits and at the end of 1993 versions of some episodes, 1993 Fraggle Rock ending credits replace 1982-1987 Fraggle Rock ending credits. The intro was shortened on Hub in 2010-2013, and Hub Network in 2013-2014 and Discovery Family since 2014. In the cartoonish/animated intro, the Roland D-50 patch "Piano-Fifty" was heard. In the themes, the Yamaha DX7 internal factory patch "Electric Bass 1" was heard in 1983-1987. It got cartoonish/animated in season 6 (1987).

"Fraggle Rock" was co-produced by British television company Television South (TVS), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, U.S. pay television service Home Box Office and Henson Associates. Unlike "Sesame Street", it was intended from the start to be an international production. Henson described the "Fraggle Rock" series as "a high-energy, raucous musical romp. It's a lot of silliness. It's wonderful." While the program proved accessible to audiences of all ages, it used the fantasy creatures as examples to deal with serious issues. These included prejudice, spirituality, personal identity, the environment, and social conflict.
