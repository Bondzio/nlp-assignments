Invented tradition

Invented traditions are those traditions of recent origin which may claim to be old but are usually recently invented (made up). For example, watching "It's a Wonderful Life" every Christmas for three years in a row and then claiming it is a family tradition is an "invented tradition". Decorating with evergreens at Christmastime however is a tradition, or traditional.
