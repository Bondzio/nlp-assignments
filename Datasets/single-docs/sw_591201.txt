Leirpollen (concentration camp)

Leirpollen was a concentration camp in Norway - in county SÃ¸r-Varangeer, during World War Two. Norway was occupied by Germany's military during Adolf Hitler's rule of Germany.

The camp was called an extermination camp (or death camp) for Russian [and other Soviet soldiers who were] prisoners, in a 1998 report by Norway's government.

The camp had 150 prisoners, and [at least] it had Soviet prisoners. Also suspected members of the Persfjord groups partisans on the Varanger Peninsula, were held in the camp. I 1943, 11 prisoners were killed, by being hit with one [or more] clubs.

The prisoners were moved (out of the prison camp) in February 1944, to another prison camp - Storskog - closer to the border between Soviet and Norway;
