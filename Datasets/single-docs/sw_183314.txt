Guru Ram Das

Guru Ram Das () was born on September 24 1534 in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan and died 1 September, 1581, in Amritsar, Punjab, India. He became the fourth of the ten Sikh Gurus on March 26 1552. He urged Sikhs to not just sit in peace while meditating. He urged them to actively join in with other peoples fun while meditating.

Guru Ram Das nominated Guru Arjun Dev, his youngest son, as the next Guru of the Sikhs.

Guru Ram helped build Ramdaspur by digging a second sacred pool after being instructed to do so by Guru Amar Das. Pilgrims came from miles to hear Guru Ram preach or to help him dig the sacred pool. The sacred pool (Holy tank) was named Amristar - which means "great pool of nectar".
