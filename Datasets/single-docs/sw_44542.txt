Myst

Myst is a computer game designed by the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller in a company called Cyan. The Millers started working on Myst in 1991 and released it for the Macintosh computer on September 24, 1993. "Myst" was later released on many different computers and video game consoles.

In "Myst", the player starts by using a special book to travel to Myst Island. There, the player uses other special books to travel to different worlds called "Ages". Solving puzzles on different Ages helps the player learn more about Myst Island and the people who live there. The player can make choices that change the ending of the game.

When "Myst" was released, it became very popular. Critics loved "Myst" because it felt like a real world. "Myst" was the best-selling computer game until The Sims was released in 2002. "Myst" helped the CD-ROM get more popular when the CD-ROM was new. Because "Myst" was so popular, four sequels were made, and three "Myst" novels were written.
