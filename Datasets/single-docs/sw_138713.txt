Egon Schiele

Egon Schiele (12 June 1890 â€“ 31 October 1918) (, or SHEE-luh) was a painter from Austria. Some people see his work as expressionist, but also in the art nouveau movement. With Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka, he was among the most important artists of Wiener Moderne. The most important collection of Schiele's work is in the Leopold Museum in Vienna.

Schiele died of influenza, at only 28 years old of the pandemic known as Spanish flu, which killed between 20 and 100 million people.
