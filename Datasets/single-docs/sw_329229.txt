Parrotfish

Parrotfishes are a group of fishes that used to be thought of as a family ("Scaridae"), but now are usuaully considered a subfamily ("Scarinae") of the wrasses. They live in shallow tropical and subtropical oceans around the world. Their numbers are largest in the Indo-Pacific region. They mostly live in coral reefs and seagrass beds. They take an important part in bioerosion. There are about 90 species of parrotfish living today.

Parrotfish are very colourful. Their name comes from the parrot-like beak formed by their teeth. The buccal cavity (cheek) of the parrotfish secretes the 'sleeping sack' that the fish sleeps in overnight. It is a semi-translucent sack which completely surrounds the parrot fish. In the morning the sack is discarded. You can see these on the sea bed floor during the following day.
