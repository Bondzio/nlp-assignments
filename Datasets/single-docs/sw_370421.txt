Yayi Boni

Dr. Thomas Yayi Boni (born 1 July 1952) is a Beninese politician and banker. He served as the President of Benin from 6 April 2006 to 6 April 2016. He was re-elected to a second term in March 2011. From 29 January 2012 to 27 January 2013, he was the Chairperson of the African Union.

On 15 March 2007, Yayi Boni survived an assassination attempt. Several of the people travelling with the president were wounded in gunfire between the presidential guard and the would-be assassins.

On 23 October 2012, the BBC said that his doctor, niece, and former commerce minister had been arrested in a plot to poison the president. The niece changed his medicine to a "toxic substance" while he was on a state visit to Brussels.
