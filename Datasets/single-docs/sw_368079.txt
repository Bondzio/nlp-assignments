Usa-jinjū

, also known as , is a Japanese Shinto shrine in the city of Usa in Ōita Prefecture on the island of Kyushu. 

The shrine was founded in the Wadō era (708-714). 

A Buddhist temple called "Miroku-ji" was built next to it in 779, making it what is believed to be the first shrine-temple ("jingū-ji") ever. The shrine-temple complex, called , lasted until 1868.

"Usa" first appears in the chronicles of Imperial history during the reign of Empress Shōtoku.

"Usa jingū" was designated as the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") for the old Buzen Province. It serves today as one of the "ichinomiya" of Oita and Fukuoka Prefectures.
From 1871 through 1946, Usa was officially listed among the first rank of government supported shrines.

"Usa" is today the center of over 40,000 branch Hachiman shrines. In Shinto belief, the many Hachiman shrines have extended the reach of the "kami" at Usa.
