Yu Suzuki

Both of Suzuki's parents were school teachers. When Suzuki was growing up, he wanted to be a dentist. But he could not pass the test, so he decided to study computers instead. In 1983 he started working at Sega. In 1993 he wrote a famous game called Virtua Fighter. It was so famous, that it was added to the Smithsonian museum in Washington DC, as an example of an important game.
