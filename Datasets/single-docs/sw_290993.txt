Garage

A garage is a place for storing cars. There are many kinds of garages used for different things.

A residential garage is a garage that is part of a house or similar building. Some garages are directly connected (called "attached") to the house, while others are separate and called a "detached" garage". The garage will have a large garage door that opens to let cars in and out, which is often opened by a motor.

A parking garage is a large covered structure, often made of concrete, which is used for holding many cars. Parking garages may have more than one level.

An automobile repair shop may also be called a garage, although it is for repairing cars rather than just storing them.
