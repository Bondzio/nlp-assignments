Elimination Chamber

Elimination Chamber is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event held by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The Event replaced the No Way Out pay-per-view except in Germany where it is still called, No Way Out.

WWE released a DVD with the title "Satan's Prison: The Anthology of the Elimination Chamber" ("Iron Will" in Europe), which included every Elimination Chamber match up until Elimination Chamber 2010, in July of 2010. The DVD is very edited mostly because of Chris Benoit.
