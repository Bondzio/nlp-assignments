Lolo Ferrari

Lolo Ferrari (9 February 1963 - 5 March 2000) was the stage name of a French dancer and actress billed as "the woman with the largest breasts in the world", though their size was artificially achieved. She was born Eve Valois in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dome.

Encouraged by her husband, Ferrari underwent numerous plastic surgery operations to create a silicone-enhanced bust (22 enlargements, a Guinness world record).

She became a regular guest on the television series "Eurotrash" on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.

Ferrari committed suicide by drug overdose in Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes.
