Technologist

A technologist is a person who specializes in using technology. While similar to a technician, the two are not the same. Where both are employed, a technician works for a technologist. A technician is someone with a basic knowledge of a technology. A technologist is someone who completely understands the technology and other technologies that can be applied. In the field of health care, for example, both may be called a "lab tech". While they may have overlapping duties, a laboratory or lab technician performs the duties he or she is trained for. The lab technologist is the project manager who supervises the lab. 

A technologist may be known by different job titles in various organizations. For example, a Director of Information Technology is often a technologist. The same is true for a Technology Project Manager. Smaller organizations may use a technologist to perform many functions. In some cases, a project may be started using a staff member or technician, then handed off to a technologist as the project progresses. The technologist is a specialist in how technologies can be used to meet the goals of the project owner. In Canada, engineers with training from other countries may find themselves working as an engineering technologist.
