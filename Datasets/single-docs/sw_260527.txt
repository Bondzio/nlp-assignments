Sodium phosphate

Sodium phosphate is a group of chemical compounds. The phosphate atom can hold three other atoms. They can be three hydrogen (phosphoric acid), two hydrogen and one sodium(sodium dihydrogen phosphate), one hydrogen and two sodium (disodium hydrogen phosphate), or three sodium (trisodium phosphate).

Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, also known as monosodium phosphate, is a chemical compound with the formula NaHPO. It is acidic. It is used in some baking powders. It is used as a laxative or a pH buffer (something that keeps a chemical from getting more acidic or basic). It is made by reaction of a little sodium hydroxide with phosphoric acid.

Disodium hydrogen phosphate, also known as disodium phosphate is a chemical compound with the formula NaHPO. It is about neutral (not acidic or basic). It is used to prevent clumping in foods. It is made by reaction of some sodium hydroxide with phosphorus.

Trisodium phosphate, also known as sodium phosphate, is a chemical compound with the formula NaPO. It is basic. It formerly was used in detergents, but the phosphate fueled algal blooms. It is made by combining sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid.
