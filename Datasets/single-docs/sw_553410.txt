Sepoy

A sepoy was an Indian footsoldier (of whatever religion) in the East India Company army or the British Indian Army. The term comes from the Persian language "Sipahi".

In the modern Indian Army, Pakistan Army, Bangladesh Army and Nepalese Army, it is still used for the rank of private soldier.
