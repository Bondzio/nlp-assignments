Los Angeles Rams

The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team in Los Angeles, California. Originally known as the Cleveland Rams, then the Los Angeles Rams, and still later as the St. Louis Rams, they are currently in the Western Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The team has won two NFL Championships and one Super Bowl.

On May 31, 2009, the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" reported that the Rams were up for sale. The sale price was not known, but "Forbes" magazine's estimated that the Rams' value was $929 million.

From 1995 to 2015, the Rams called St. Louis their home. Later, the team wanted to move back to Los Angeles. Stan Kroenke, the Rams owner, met with other NFL owners to approve the move. The owners approved the Rams' move to Los Angeles with a 30â€“2 margin. The Rams will return to Los Angles at the beginning of the 2016 season.
