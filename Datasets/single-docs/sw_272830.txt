Dance of Death is an album by Iron Maiden. It is their thirteenth album and went on sale on 8 September 2003. It was produced by Kevin Shirley and Steve Harris.

The album was well-received; one person who reviewed it said it was a "triumphant return to form for these heavy metal legends.

The picture on the front of the album has many mistakes in it. Some people appear to have broken bones. Others look like they are standing on top of people or animals.
