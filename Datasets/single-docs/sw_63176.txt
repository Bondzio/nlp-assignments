Kars Province

Kars is a province of Turkey. It is in the northeastern part of the country. It shares part of its border with the Republic of Armenia. 

From 1878 until 1917 most of the present-day Turkish province of Kars was part of the Russian oblast of Kars. 

In 1919 and 1920 the province came under the control of the Democratic Republic of Armenia as the Vanand province (with the city of Kars as its capital). Its territory was ceded to Turkey by the Soviet Union in the Treaty of Kars.
