Reinhard Heydrich

Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich (7 March 1904, Halle – 4 June 1942, Prague) was a high-ranking Nazi officer in World War II.

Heydrich was German SS-Obergruppenführer (General) of the "Sicherheitsdienst". He was the head of the RSHA, which included the police and the Gestapo. He was one of those responsible for the Holocaust.

In 1941 Hermann Göring gave Heydrich the order to arrange the "Final Solution". Heydrich was attacked in Prague on 27 May 1942 by two Czech and Slovak soldiers 
trained by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). They had been sent (with a small support team) by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Heydrich died a week later in hospital from sepsis caused by the injuries he sustained.
