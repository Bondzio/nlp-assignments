Treeshrew

A treeshrew is a small mammal from the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. They make up the families Tupaiidae and Ptilocercidae and all of order Scandentia. There are 20 species in 5 genera.

Although called treeshrews, they are not true shrews (although they were previously classified in the Insectivora), and are not all arboreal. Among other things, they eat "Rafflesia" fruit.
