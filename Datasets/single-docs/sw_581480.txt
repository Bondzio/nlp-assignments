Council for Secular Humanism

The Council for Secular Humanism was a non-profit organization that promoted secular values.

In 1991, the Council for Secular Humanism combined with the the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal to form the Center for Inquiry. In 2016, the Center for Inquiry merged with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, keeping one office in Washington DC. This made the Center for Inquiry the largest secularist organization in the United States.
