Pacific giant salamander

Pacific giant salamanders ("Dicamptodon") are a family and genus of large salamanders.

The salamanders may grow up to long, and are found in the western USA and southwestern British Columbia. Apart from their large size, they are like the mole salamander family (Ambystomatidae).

Most salamanders are silent but the Pacific giant salamander can make noise. The adults can live on land or in water.

The genus has four species: Cope's giant salamander ("D. copei"), the Idaho giant salamander ("D. aterrimus"), the coastal giant salamander ("D. tenebrosus"), and the California giant salamander ("D. ensatus").
