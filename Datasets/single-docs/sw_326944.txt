Hop o' My Thumb

"Hop o' My Thumb" (French: Le petit Poucet) is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It was first published in 1697 in Paris by Claude Barbin in "Histoires ou contes du temps pass√©" (Stories or Tales of Past Times), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The story tells of several brothers abandoned by their parents. The smallest brother is the same size as a person's thumb. He saves his brothers from an ogre. Perrault's rhyming moral at the end of the story tells readers that sometimes the smallest boy in the family brings good things to all.
