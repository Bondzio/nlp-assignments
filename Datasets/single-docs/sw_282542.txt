Central Hockey League

The Central Hockey League (CHL) is a mid-level professional hockey league in the United States. It is owned by Global Entertainment Corporation. It was started in 1992.

The first CHL season was in 1992-1993. It started with six teams, including the Oklahoma City Blazers, the Tulsa Oilers, the Wichita Thunder, the Memphis RiverKings, the Dallas Freeze and the Fort Worth Fire.

In 1996-97, the Huntsville Channel Cats, along with the planned 1996â€“97 Southern Hockey League (SHL) expansion teams Columbus Cottonmouths, Macon Whoopee, and Nashville Nighthawks, joined the Central Hockey League after the SHL ended.

The CHL came together with the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) in 2001.

The CHL commissioner is now Duane Lewis, who succeeded Brad Treliving on an temporary basis after Treliving took a position with the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes following the 2006-2007 season. Treliving co-founded the WPHL in 1996, and after the 2001 merger, served with the CHL for seven years. Lewis was named the permanent commissioner in June 2008.

On June 1, 2010 the league announced that it would come together with the International Hockey League.

The CHL is divided into two Conferences. Teams compete every year for the Ray Miron President's Cup.
