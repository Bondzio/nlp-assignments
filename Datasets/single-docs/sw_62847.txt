The Internationale

"The Internationale" (, ; , , , ) is a very well known French communist, socialist, and social democratic/democratic socialist song. The Russian and Chinese versions are also very famous. The Russian version, written by Аркадий Яковлевич Коц (Arkady Yakolevich Kots), was, before 1944, the national anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The French words, written by Eugene Pottier, were originally supposed to be sung to the tune of "La Marseillaise", but a separate tune was created for it by a Belgian named Pierre Degeyter. The song is known by its tune, and its chorus, "C'est la Lutte Finale / Groupons-nous, et demain / L'Internationale / Sera le genre humain". The Chinese lyrics were written by 瞿秋白, or Qu Qiubai.
