Italian invasion of French Somaliland

The Italian invasion of French Somaliland was an Italian campaign during World War II. 

In summer 1940 the Italians occupied the western areas of French Somaliland, while attacking southern France. The armistice stopped their advance. In early 1941 they withdraw from the areas occupied, because of the British attacks on Italian East Africa (Eritrea, Somalia & Ethiopia).
