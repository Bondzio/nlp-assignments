Hershel W. Gober

Hershel Wayne Gober (born December 21, 1936) is a former government official and Vietnam War veteran. He served as acting United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) two times during the Clinton administration. The first time was from July 1, 1997 until January 2, 1998 between the resignation of Secretary Jesse Brown and the appointment of Togo D. West, Jr. as Acting Secretary. The second time came on July 25, 2000 and lasted until January 20, 2001 after the resignation of Secretary West; this time Gober served in the post until the end of the Clinton presidency.

He started out in the VA as Deputy Secretary, serving from February 4, 1993 until August 10, 2000. Gober was also Secretary-designate, when Clinton named him on July 31, 1997 to replace Jesse Brown. However, the nomination was withdrawn before Senate action began. That happened on October 27 the same year. 

During his time as Secretary, Gober headed a delegation that traveled to Vietnam to try to find information about missing veterans there. He also worked to improve health care and create more clinics for veterans. 

Before serving in the VA, Gober was Director of the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs from January 4, 1988 to February 4, 1993 during President Clinton's time as Governor.

Gober served two tours in Vietnam. He also worked with an American/Vietnamese team that made Vietnamese songs. Later, in 1969, he was hurt while serving as a company commander.
