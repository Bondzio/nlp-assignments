Bryant–Denny Stadium

Bryant–Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is the home stadium for the University of Alabama college football team. The stadium opened in 1929, and was first named Denny Stadium, in honor of former Alabama president George Hutchenson Denny. The stadium's name was changed to Bryant–Denny Stadium in 1975 to honor Alabama coach Paul "Bear" Bryant. It currently can seat 92,012 people, and is the fourth largest stadium in the SEC, the eleventh largest stadium in the United States and the 17th largest non-racing stadium by seating in the world. Since the 1988 football season, the university has sold out every game played at the stadium. In February 2009 the University of Alabama board of trustees gave approval to begin stadium expansion of the south endzone, with room to seat about 101,000, which, when it is completed, will make Bryant–Denny Stadium the largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference.
