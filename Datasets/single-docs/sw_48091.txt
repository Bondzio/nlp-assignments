William Pitt the Younger

William Pitt the Younger (28 May 1759 â€“ 23 January 1806) was a British politician of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1782-1783, 1783-1801 and 1804-1806. He was Prime Minister from 1783 to 1801, and again from 1804 until his death. He is known as "William Pitt the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt the Elder, who also served as Prime Minister of Great Britain.
