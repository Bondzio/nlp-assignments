Lüscher color test

The Lüscher color test is a psychological test invented by Dr. Max Lüscher in Basel, Switzerland. Lüscher believed that sensory perception of color is "all shared by all", but that color preferences are not. This difference allows subjective states to be objectively measured by using test colors.

Lüscher believed that because the color selections are guided in a specific manner, they reveal the person as they really are, not as they perceive themselves or would like to be perceived.
