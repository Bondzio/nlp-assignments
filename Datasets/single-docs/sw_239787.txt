Ignition (album)

Ignition is the second album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 1992. This was their first album released on Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz).

Released during the breakthrough year for alternative rock and grunge, The Offspring achieved small success with "Ignition" in Southern California and gathered a small following. This success would grow with their next album "Smash". "Kick Him When He's Down" was released as a promotional single in 1995 after the band had risen in popularity; it is one of the few singles that did not appear on the "Greatest Hits" album.
