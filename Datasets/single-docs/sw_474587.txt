The Cinque Ports is a confederation of coastal towns in Kent and Sussex. It was originally formed for military and trade purposes, but is now ceremonial.

The Federation is supported by two towns, one of which is Rye, and the other {a few miles back from the coast) is Winchelsea. These towns once supported militias which could be used for defence of the area.
