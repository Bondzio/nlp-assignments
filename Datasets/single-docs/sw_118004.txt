Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) is a professional honorary group meant for the advancement of the arts and sciences of motion pictures.

The Academy is known around the world for its yearly Academy Awards, known to most people as the "Oscars." Also, the Academy gives Student Academy Awards to filmmakers at the undergraduate and graduate level each year; awards up to five Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting each year; and runs the Margaret Herrick Library in Beverly Hills, California and the Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study in Hollywood, California, which will grow to include Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, to open as a tourist site in 2017.

The president of the Academy has been Cheryl Boone Issacs since 2013.
