Application programming interface

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions, procedures, methods or classes used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, software libraries or any other service providers running on the computer. A computer programmer uses the API to make
application programs.

Types of API include web services API like the Twitter API, which allows programs to use the API to receive updates on tweets.
