Abstract algebra

Abstract algebra is a part of math which studies algebraic structures. These include:
It is normal to build a theory on one kind of structure, like group theory or category theory. 

The purpose of the theory of each concept is to organize the precise definition of the concept, examples of it, its substructures, the ways to relate different examples of the concept algebraically (these are called morphisms in some cases), and the concept's applications, both inside its own theory and outside in other areas of mathematics.

During history, different fields of mathematics have used algebras. Algebras are about finding or specifying rules on how to calculate with certain mathematical formulas and expressions. Another algebra (which is not "abstract") is elementary algebra, for example.
