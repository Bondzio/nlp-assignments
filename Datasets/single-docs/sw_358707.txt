Zara was born in London. She is the eldest granddaughter of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. When she was born, she was sixth in line to the throne. She is now 15th in line.

She has an older brother, Peter Phillips (born 15 November 1977). She has two half-sisters, Felicity Tonkin (born in 1985 after her father had an affair) and Stephanie Phillips, born 2 October 1997, from her father's second marriage.

The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a title. It is thought their mother did not want them to have one.
