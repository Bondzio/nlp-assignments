Emma Watson

Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is a English actress and model. She is known for playing Hermione Granger in the "Harry Potter" movie series alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. She has played roles in other movies aside from the Harry Potter series, including "The Tale of Despereaux" (2008) and "Ballet Shoes" (2007). She became the UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in July 2014.

As Watson has grown older, she has become more interested in fashion. She says that she thinks fashion is like art, which she studied in school. In September 2008, she told a blogger, "I've been focusing on art a lot, and fashion's a great extension of that."

In 2008, the British news reported that Watson was going to be the model for the fashion house Chanel instead of Keira Knightley, but both Watson and Knightley said that this was not true. In June 2009, Watson said that she would be helping Burberry by being a part of their new Autumn/Winter 2009 collection. She was later a part of Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign with her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and Max Hurd.
