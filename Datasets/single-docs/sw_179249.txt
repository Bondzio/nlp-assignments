Sailboat

A sailboat, sailing boat or yacht is a boat that has sails. Wind blows against the sails, pushing the boat through the water. The word covers many kinds of boats, from small sailboards to large sailing ships. Usually, a sailboat has two sails: a mainsail and a head sail or jib. When the wind blows from behind, there can be used an extra sail, a spinnaker.
