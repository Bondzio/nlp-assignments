The black-capped chickadee is about 12–15 cm (5–6 in) long and weighs 9-15 g (0.32-0.49 oz).

The male and female black-capped chickadees look the same. The black-capped chickadee has black and white on its head. The top of the head and throat are black, and the sides are white. It has a short, black beak.

The back of the body of the black-capped chickadee is gray. The front of the body is white and light brown. The bird has short wings and a short tail.

The song of the black-capped chickadee is a clear whistle.

In the summer, black-capped chickadees eat many insects. In the winter, they eat seeds and berries. They will hide seeds in different places and return later to eat
them. When two chickadees want to build a nest, they will use a hole in a tree.
