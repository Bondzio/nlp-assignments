1948 Summer Olympics

The 1948 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XIV Olympiad, were held at London in the United Kingdom. 

These were the first Summer Olympics to be held since the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, because no Games were held during World War II.

In part, the games were thought to be a success because the Organizing Committee did not go into debt. The final financial report showed a â‚¤29,000 profit.

A total of 59 nations sent athletes to compete at the London Games.
