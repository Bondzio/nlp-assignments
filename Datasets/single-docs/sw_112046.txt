Chip 'n Dale

Chip 'n' Dale are two fictional, animated chipmunks. They were made by The Walt Disney Company. Their names are a pun from the name "Chippendale" (see Thomas Chippendale). Chip has a black nose, one tooth, and smooth short hair on his head. Dale has a red nose, two teeth, and ruffled hair. They like peanuts and apples. Chip is a reliable character. Dale is an easygoing character.

Chip 'n' Dale first appeared in the cartoon "Private Pluto" in 1943. They were in 23 animated short films. Usually they got into trouble with either Pluto or Donald Duck.


In 1989, Chip and Dale starred in an animated series "Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers". In the series, they formed a detective agency with three new characters. There were 65 episodes aired over three seasons. Their personalities changed a bit for the series. Instead of causing trouble, in the series they fought crime and helped the less fortunate. Chip was the responsible, no-nonsense leader who wore a leather jacket and fedora. Dale was goofy, laid-back, and wore a Hawaiian shirt.
