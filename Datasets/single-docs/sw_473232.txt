Ahmed Kathrada

Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada (21 August 1929 â€“ 28 March 2017), sometimes known by the nickname "Kathy", was a South African politician and former political prisoner and anti-apartheid activist.

Kathrada's involvement in the anti-apartheid activities of the African National Congress (ANC) led him to his long-term imprisonment following the Rivonia Trial. He was held at Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison with Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. 

Following his release in 1990, he was elected to serve as a member of parliament, representing the ANC.

Kathrada died at a medical center in Johannesburg from complications of a blood clot in the brain on 28 March 2017, aged 87.
