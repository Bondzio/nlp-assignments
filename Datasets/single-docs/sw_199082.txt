Philology

Philology considers both form and meaning in linguistic expression. It combines linguistics and literary studies.

Classical philology is the philology of the Greek, Latin and Sanskrit languages.
Any classical language can be studied philologically, and indeed describing a language as "classical" is to imply the existence of a philological tradition associated with it.
