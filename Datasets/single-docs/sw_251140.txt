Swiss Family Robinson

Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 Walt Disney movie. It is based on an 1812 book of the same name by Johann David Wyss. The movie stars John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Janet Munro, and Sessue Hayakawa as a pirate chief.

The movie is about a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was filmed on Tobago (with great difficulties) and in England. It was released just before Christmas 1960. It was a huge box office hit, and is one of the top movie moneymakers of all time.
