It (character)

It, also known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown or Bob Gray, is the title character and main antagonist of Stephen King's 1986 horror novel "It". The character is an demonic entity that murders or kidnaps the local children of Derry, Maine about every twenty-seven years, using many powers that include the ability to shapeshift, manipulate, and go unnoticed by adults.

King came up with the idea for Pennywise after asking himself what scared children "more than anything else in the world", which he felt was clowns. The character has been described as one of the scariest clowns in popular culture and is a global icon.

The character was portrayed by Tim Curry in the 1990 television adaptation of the same name; and will be portrayed by Bill Skarsg√•rd in the upcoming 2017 movie adaptation.
