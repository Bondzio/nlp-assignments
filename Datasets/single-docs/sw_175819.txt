Knobbed whelk

The Knobbed Whelk ("Busycon carica") is a gastropod mollusc which is protected by a thick, hard shell.

This mollusc is found in shallow waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast of North America from Massachusetts to northern Florida.

The Knobbed Whelk has a spiral shell with knobs (or spines) along its shoulder. The shell is up to 9.5 inches (24 cm) long. The shell is light gray to tan, and often has brown and white streaks.

Knobbed Whelks eat clams. They open the clam with their hard shell, and insert their long proboscis. They eat using a radula, a rough tongue-like organ that has thousands of tiny denticles (tooth-like protrusions).
