Aerodynamics

Aerodynamics means studying how air (or gas) travels around something moving through it. Streamlining to reduce drag in vehicles is a major field in aerodynamics. Aircraft design is another.

The study of gases that are not in motion is called aerostatics.

Aerodynamics comes from Aero (Air), and Dynamic (Moving).
