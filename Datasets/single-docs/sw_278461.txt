At age 14, Griffith began dating 22-year old actor Don Johnson. He co-starred with her mother in "The Harrad Experiment". Griffith was an extra. They had a six-month marriage in 1976. Tatum O'Neal said in her 2004 autobiography that around that time, she (then 12) and Griffith (then 18) were in an opium-fueled orgy in a Paris hotel room.

In September 1981, Griffith married Steven Bauer. He was her co-star in the TV movie "She's in the Army Now". They have a son, Alexander, born on August 22, 1985. The couple divorced in 1987. Griffith later said she had problems with cocaine and liquor after her divorce from Bauer. "What I did was drink myself to sleep at night," she said. "If I wasn't with someone, I was an unhappy girl."

She checked into rehab in 1988. During this time, she got back together with Johnson, became sober and pregnant. They remarried in June 1989. Their daughter, Dakota Johnson, was born on October 4, 1989. They separated in June 1994. They divorced in 1996.
