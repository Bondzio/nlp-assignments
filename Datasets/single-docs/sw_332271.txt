Futhorc

The Anglo-Saxon alphabet is a runic script that was used from the 5th to the 8th century. It extends Elder Futhark from 24 to between 26 and 33 characters. Like the Elder Futhark, it is named after the first few letters in the series: These transliterate to Futhorc in modern English. The script was used to record Old English and Old Frisian. Inscriptions using Futhorc are rare after the 9th century, and completely disappear after the Norman conquest.
