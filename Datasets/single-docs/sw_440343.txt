Colony of Natal

The Colony of Natal was a British colony in south-eastern Africa. It was formed on 4 May 1843 after the British government had annexed the independent Boer Republic of Natalia. On 31 May 1910, it unified with three other colonies to form the Union of South Africa. It now forms the modern-day province of KwaZulu-Natal of the Republic of South Africa.
