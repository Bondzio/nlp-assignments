Sex-positive feminism

Sex-positive feminism (or pro-sex feminism) is a movement. It began in the early 1980s. Many people in the movement think sexual freedom is an important part of women's freedom. Sex-positive feminism is often difficult to define.

Many authors, including Gayle Rubin, see the roots of sex-positive feminism in the work of sex workers and sex reformers.
