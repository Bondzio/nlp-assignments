Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century

"Le Mondes 100 Books of the Century"' is a list of books thought to be the 100 best of the 20th century. The list was made in 1999 by the French retail store Fnac and the Paris newspaper "Le Monde".

Starting with a list of 200 titles made by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French people answered the question, "Which books have stayed in your memory?" The list includes novels, poetry, theatre, and comic strips. Some received the Nobel Prize in Literature. 

Note: Language and Country refer to the author's career generally, not to the book specifically.
