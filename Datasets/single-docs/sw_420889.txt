W체rstelstand

The W체rstelstand ("sausage stand") is the Austrian type of the take-away. These stands are very common in Vienna. Usually, they sell different kinds of sausages. It is not unusual for the people in Vienna to grab a pair of sausages after a perfomance at a theatre or opera house. In addition, a W체rstelstand traditionally also sells Leberk채se. As a side dish, different chile peppers, gherkins and other pickled vegetables are available.
