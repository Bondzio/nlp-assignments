Scaffold

A scaffold is a temporary structure used for support. Originally scaffolds were made of wood, and bamboo scaffolds are still used in many parts of the world. In the western world they are now made of metal.

The most common use of scaffolds is to allow work on buildings. Another use of the word was the wooden platforms built for executions. This is now a rare use of the word.
