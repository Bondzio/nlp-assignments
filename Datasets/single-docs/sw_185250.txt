Amygdaloideae

Amygdaloideae (incorrectly called Prunaceae) is a subfamily of flowering plants. This subfamily is placed within the family Rosaceae.

Since 2011 there has been a big change in how the name of this subfamily is used. Before 2011, the only plants in this subfamily were the stone fruit such as plums, peaches, almonds. Now the subfamily includes all of family Rosaceae except subfamily Rosoideae and subfamily Dryadoideae. Commercially important members of the Amygdaloideae now include plum, apple, Spiraea, and many others.
