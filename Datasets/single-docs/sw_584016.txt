Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge

The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Cooper River in South Carolina, United States, connecting downtown Charleston to Mount Pleasant. The bridge is named after former U.S. representative Arthur Ravenel Jr.. 

The eight lane bridge satisfied the capacity of U.S. Route 17 when it opened in 2005 to replace two old cantilever truss bridges. The bridge has a main span of 1,546 feet (471 m), the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. It was built using the design-build method and was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff.
