Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (, also called the DJIA, Dow 30, or informally The Dow Jones or The Dow) is one of the stock market indices created by the nineteenth century "Wall Street Journal" editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder Charles Dow.

There are 30 companies, all from the USA, and traded on either the NYSE or the NASDAQ, that make up the Industrial Average. They together represent the general economy of the United States.

It used to be that most of the companies were in heavy industries, such as steel, oil, autos, and appliances, but it now has companies from many different industries. The most recent companies to join the index are from the technology industry.

Since March 18, 2015, these are the companies that currently make up the Dow Jones:
