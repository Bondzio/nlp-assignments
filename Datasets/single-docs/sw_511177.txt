2015–16 Premier League

The 2015–16 Premier League is the 24th Premier League that is taking place from 8 August 2015 to 17 May 2016.

It was won by Leicester City who, guided by Claudio Ranieri, upset bookmakers odds of 5000/1 at the start of the season by finishing 10 points clear of 2nd place Arsenal to win their 1st ever top flight English league title.

The season was supposed to end on Sunday 15th May, but instead ended on Tuesday 17th May due to the abandonment and subsequent rearrangement of Manchester United's last home game against A.F.C. Bournemouth after a bomb scare.
