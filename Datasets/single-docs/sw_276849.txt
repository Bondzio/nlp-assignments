Declaration of Rights and Grievances

The Declaration of Rights and Grievances was a document that made it official that taxes forced on British colonists without their formal consent were not lawful. This was especially for the Stamp Act, which required that documents, newspapers, and playing cards were to be printed on special stamped and taxed paper.
