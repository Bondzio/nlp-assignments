Angel Falls

Angel Falls is the tallest waterfall in the world. It falls off a mountain called "Auyantepui". It is found in Venezuela, which is a country in South America. The falls drop so far, the water turns into mist when it reaches the bottom.

The falls are named for Jimmy Angel. Jimmy Angel was an airplane pilot that crashed at the top of the falls in 1937.

Angel Falls is also called Salto Ángel or indigenously Kerepakupai-merú. The indigenous name derived from the Pemón natives means "falls from the deepest place". Ironically, the more famous name of the falls had nothing to do with the connotation that its water fell from the heavens.
