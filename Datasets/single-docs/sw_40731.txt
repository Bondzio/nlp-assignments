Scream (movie)

Scream is a 1996 American teen horror movie by Wes Craven. The actors in the movie include Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox and Drew Barrymore. The movie is a mix of styles being a slasher, horror, thriller, mystery and comedy. The theme song for the movie is "Red Right Hand" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

A high school girl is stalked by a killer wearing a mask. She tries to find out who the killer is and learns secrets about the town. Along the way the characters also talk about how the events would usually be shown in a slasher horror movie. This is the source of the comedy. The movie was very well received globally, after the genre of horror movies had somewhat vanished from mainstream Hollywood the genre was revamped and made to be a 'typical' horror movie and was named the defining horror movie of the 90s. it's main characters are known to the public, before in the 80s horror movies had tiny budgets e.g. Halloween which was made for $30,000 although the budget for Scream is not large it is substantially larger than that of other movies of the same genre.

The movie was very successful. People who judge movies liked it and three other movies were made in the series. "Scream 2" was released in 1997, "Scream 3" was released in 2000 and "Scream 4" was released in 2011. It has been recognised as the most successful horror series ever after the movies combined takings earned over $500 million.

After this success many other movies copying Scream's style were also released including "I Know What You Did Last Summer". And the horror genre has being replenished with many re-makes occurring even a re-make of Halloween after audiences are still attracted to the genre mainly due to the Scream series.
