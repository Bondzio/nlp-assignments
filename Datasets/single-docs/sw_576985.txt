Pim Fortuyn List

The Pim Fortuyn List, Dutch: "Lijst Pim Fortuyn" (shortened "LPF"), was a Dutch political party.

The Pim Fortuyn List was a populist party, established by Pim Fortuyn, and also named after him, in 2002.

The LPF participated for the first time in the general elections of 2002, shortly after the murder of Fortuyn, and won 26 seats. 

Numerous quarrels within the party caused its downfall. The LPF was disestablished in 2008.
