The 2017 Indian presidential election was held in India on 17 July 2017, and counting was done on 20 July 2017, five days before the incumbent President's term expires. The incumbent is eligible for re-election, as no term limits exist in India.
Initially receiving speculation for a re-election bid, Pranab Mukherjee decided not to run again in 2017 due to health concerns and problems relating to his age.

Results will be declared on 20 July 2017.
