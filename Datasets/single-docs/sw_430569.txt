Pro Wrestling Noah

Pro Wrestling Noah (PW Noah or Noah) is an Japanese professional wrestling company founded in 2000 by Mitsuharu Misawa. It was founded in 2000 after Misawa left All Japan Pro Wrestling because he did not like the direction Giant Baba's widow Motoko Baba was putting the company in.
