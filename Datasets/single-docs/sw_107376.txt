Dennis Rodman

Dennis Rodman (born May 13, 1961) played basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1986 to 2000. He won two championships with the Detroit Pistons and three more with the Chicago Bulls. Even though he was only 6'8" tall, many people think he was the best rebounder in NBA history. He led the NBA in rebounding (rebounds per game) for seven straight seasons. Only Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in rebounds per game for more total seasons in a career. Rodman has the highest rebound rate since the statistic began in 1970-71. Although Rodman began his career as a bench player, he holds the highest rebounds per game average since offensive and defensive rebounds began in 1973-74. When he became a full-time starter, Rodman often got more rebounds than the other team's starting players got combined. He could predict where missed shots would go and knew how to tip the ball to himself for a rebound. Rodman watched film of player's shots to become a better rebounder. Rodman is also known as one of the greatest defensive players, and not just for his defensive rebounds, but his hustle defense.

Rodman was famous for dyeing his hair different colors and having many tattoos and body piercings, which he began to have after being traded by the Detroit Pistons. He has been in a few movies and television programs.

His nicknames are Worm (later called The Worm), Dennis the Menace, Rodzilla (which he named himself towards the end of the Bulls championship dynasty), Demolition Man, and El Loco (given to him by Spanish-language announcers, which translates as "The Madman").
