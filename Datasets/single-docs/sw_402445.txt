German papiermark

The German Papiermark (often just Papiermark) was the money of the Weimar Republic, from 1919 to 1923. On 15 November 1923 it was replaced by the Rentenmark, and in 1924, the Reichsmark became the offical money. In 1914, the Gold standard was abolished; there was the First World War. The period when it was used was marked by a high inflation rate. At some time, the "millions" and billions of Mark were written in words, because there was not enough space on the paper.
