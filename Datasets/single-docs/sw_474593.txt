Ford Transit Connect

The Ford Transit Connect is a compact minivan developed by Ford Europe. It has many of the same parts as the Ford Focus. The first one was made to replace the Ford Escort and Ford Fiesta-based courier vans. In Canada and the United States, the Transit Connect has no predecessor. The closest vehicle to its size was the Ford Aerostar, which was last made in 1997. The Transit Connect Wagon is designed to be part utility van and part compact car. In North America, the Transit Connect is Ford's first minivan since they stopped making the Ford Freestar in 2007.
