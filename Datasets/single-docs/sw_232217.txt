Bilby

The bilby (also known as the rabbit-eared bandicoot) is a rabbit-like marsupial. It lives in deserts, dry forests, dry grasslands, and dry shrubby areas in Australia. The bilby's pouch faces backwards. These big-eared, burrowing mammals are in danger of extinction.

The bilby, like all bandicoots, is a nocturnal animal (most active at night). Digging with its strong, clawed feet, this solitary mammal excavates long, complex burrows. Its underground dens are up to 5 feet (1.5 m) long.

At Easter, chocolate Easter Bilbies are sold as an Australian alternative to the Easter Bunny. Money raised from the sale of the bilby shaped chocolate is used to fund protection for the bilby. 

The bilby likes to eat insects and fruit, they can dig their burrows up to 2 metres deep and 3 metres long.
