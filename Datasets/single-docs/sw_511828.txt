It was poorly received by critics.

In Spain during the 16th century, two con artists called Tulio and Miguel win a map to El Dorado, the legendary golden city, during a rigged gambling match. Their trick is discovered. While being attacked by a bull, they escape and stow away in barrels which are loaded on the ships of Hernán Cortés. Cortés is sailing to the New World. They end up being caught and imprisoned in the brig. They escape with the help of Cortes' horse, Altivo. They land off the Mexican coast. Miguel recognises the many landmarks on the map, which show directions to El Dorado. 

The two approach a totem marker near a waterfall. A young woman approaches them, pursued by an army of guards. The guards see the image of Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as the same on the totem and, thinking them to be gods, escort them to El Dorado, a true golden city. They meet the city's elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok and the malicious high priest Tzekel Kan. Tannabok welcomes the two to the city warmly, while Tzekel Kan mainly sees them as an opportunity to enhance his own standing. He also believes the gods' arrival will spark the "Year of the Jaguar", a time when all wicked people will be purged from the city.
