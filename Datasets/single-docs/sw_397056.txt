Creatine

Creatine is a combination of three non-essential amino acids, methionine, arginine and glycine. Creatine is used for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the human body's energy. Creatine is already in the body as a natural substance. The body changes it to phosphocreatine. It is then stored as energy in the muscles. The energy systems of the body are: aerobic, lactate and phosphocreatine. Creatine is mainly used in the lactate system and the phosphocreatine system because these two need more energy. They also take a part of the energy from the production or the absorption of creatine.

Creatine has two principals effects: bodybuilding (or increase of muscle) and increasing the amount of protein synthesis. The body gain is caused by the water retention of cells that store creatine. For protein synthesis, it is not entirely known, but creatine can help with the recovery of muscle. During the recovery time, the creatine gives extra energy so the cells of the muscle can speed up the protein absorption of the cells.

The creatine is used by all the human body because it travels by the blood stream. But the heart and the muscles will be the main parts that use the creatine cells. Most of the creatine production will be stored in the skeletal muscle because they need a lot of energy and they need it quickly. The body produces about two grams of creatine per day. Basically, only 90 to 95 percent of the human creatine production will travel in the blood stream. The five to ten percent that is not used is lost.
