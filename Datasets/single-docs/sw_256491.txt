Love Parade disaster

The Love Parade disaster occurred on 24 July 2010, when 21 people were killed during a human crush in Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, at the Love Parade electronic music festival. At least another 511 people were injured.

The Love Parade was a popular and free access electronic dance music festival and parade that originated in 1989 in Berlin, Germany. The parade features stages, but is well known for its floats with music, DJs and dancers moving through the audience. This was the first edition of the festival that was organised in a closed-off festival area. Up to people were reported to be attending the event and 1,200 police were on hand.

The event was one of the program elements of RUHR.2010, whereby cultural events in the Ruhr area are highlighted, because the Ruhr is this year's European Capital of Culture.

The festival organizer said that there would be no more Love Parades after this. He said, "Out of respect for the victims, their families and friends, we are going to discontinue the event in the future, and that means the end of the Love Parade."
