Franco-Belgian comics

Franco-Belgian comics are comics that are made for Belgian and French readers. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books. There they are known as "BD"s, an abbreviation of "bandes dessin√©es". This means "drawn strips" in French. Many other European comics, especially Italian comics, are strongly influenced by Franco-Belgian comics. In Europe, the French language is spoken not only in France but also by about 40% of the population of Belgium and about 20% of the population of Switzerland. 

While hundreds of comic series have been made in the Franco-Belgian group, some are more notable than others. Most of those listed are aimed at younger readers:
