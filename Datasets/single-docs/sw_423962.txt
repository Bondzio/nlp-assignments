5 Seconds of Summer

5 Seconds of Summer (abbreviated 5SOS) is a pop-rock band from Sydney, Australia. The band has 4 members: Calum Hood (bass guitar, vocals, poet), Michael Clifford (guitar, vocals), Luke Hemmings (lead vocals, guitar), and Ashton Irwin (drums, vocals). The members all went to school with each other except for Ashton. They supported Hot Chelle Rae on their 2012 "Whatever" tour. They toured with One Direction for their TMH and WWA tours and gained international fame. They now have their own tour "Rock Out With Your Socks Out" (ROWYSO). Their second headline tour started in February 2016, "Sounds Live Feels Live" (SLFL).

5 Seconds of Summer started out with 3 friends (Luke Hemmings, Calum Hood, and Michael Clifford) making covers on Youtube and quickly getting recognition. Later on, they were in need of a drummer which led them to Ashton Irwin on Facebook from a mutual friend, and officially became a band on December 3,2011. Little by little, with all members singing and playing an instrument and getting serious by writing their own songs, Louis Tomlinson from One Direction (1D), directed his attention toward the 4 boys and tweeted them causing the rage of many fans to fall in love with 5 Seconds of Summer. Over the years 5SOS released EP's like "Somewhere New (2012), Unplugged (2012), Don't Stop (2014), Good Girls (2014), Amnesia (2014), and She's Kinda Hot (2015)." They proceeded to release their first album ""5 Seconds of Summer"" on June 27, 2014 which got recognition from fans worldwide and resulted in their very first headlining tour "Rock Out With Your Socks Out". Their second album "Sounds Good Feels Good" was released on October 23, 2015, followed by their second headlining world tour "Sounds Live Feels Live". 5 Seconds of Summer are currently working on their third album.
