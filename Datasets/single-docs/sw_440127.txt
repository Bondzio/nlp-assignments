Slowdive

Slowdive is an English dream pop band. They were started in 1985 in Reading by Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell. They broke up in 1995. In 2014 the band got back together. 

In 1990 Slowdive released their first EP "Slowdive".

In September 1991 the band's first album "Just for a Day" was released. 

The band wrote to Brian Eno to ask him to produce their second album. Eno said that he liked Slowdive's music but wanted to make music with them rather than produce their album.
In 1993 Slowdive released their second album "Souvlaki". Pitchfork gave the album a score of 7 out of 10. They then released two extended plays, "5 EP" and "5 EP (In Mind Remixes)".

In 1995 the band released their last album "Pygmalion". Then they broke up. 

In 2014 Slowdive got back together to play the 2014 Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona from May 29-31.
