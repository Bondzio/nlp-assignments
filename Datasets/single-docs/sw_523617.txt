Ridley (Metroid)

Ridley has received a positive critical response from fans and video game publications. Nintendo Power ranked Ridley at #6 on their list of favorite Nintendo villains. Jesse Schedeen of IGN called Ridley the real villain of the "Metroid" series, saying that they would have to include him in a "Metroid" movie because he would be too important to leave out.

Ridley has also appeared in the "Super Smash Bros." series as a boss in "Brawl"'s Subspace Emissary mode and as a boss on the Pyrosphere stage in "Super Smash Bros. for Wii U". He can help the player who damages him enough on the Pyrosphere stage.
