"The 4400" is a reference to 4400 people who disappeared mysteriously over the last century. These people all returned near Seattle, Washington at the same time from a large ball of light. They had not gotten older. After a short time, each person that came back started showing some special abilities, for example: healing, precognition (seeing the future), and persuasion.
