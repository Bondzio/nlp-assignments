Red herring

A red herring is something that misleads or distracts from an issue.

There are two ways in which it is used. It may be used as logical fallacy during an argument or as literary device that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion, for example in detective mystery books.

It has long been thought that the phrase came from kippers (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to train dogs to follow a scent, or to divert them from the correct route when hunting; however, modern research suggests that the term was probably invented in 1807 by English polemicist William Cobbett, referring to one occasion on which he had supposedly used a kipper to divert dogs from chasing a hare, and that hunters never actually used kippers to train dogs. The phrase was later borrowed to provide a formal name for the logical fallacy and literary device.
