Emperor Itoku

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

The "Gukanshō" records that he ruled from the palace of "Migario-no-miya" at Karu in what will come to be known as Yamato province.

Itoku is almost certainly a legend. The "Kojiki" records only his name and genealogy. The "Nihonshoki" includes Itoku as the third of .

The "Gukanshō" records that Itoku was the second or third son of Emperor Annei, but the surviving documents provide no basis for making guesses about why the elder brother or brothers were passed over.

During reign of Emperor Itoku, the capital of Japan was at Karu, Yamato.

The absence of information about Itoku does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei (509?-571).

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Itoku.

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
