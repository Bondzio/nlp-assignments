Monorail

A monorail is like a train, but instead of having two sets of wheels that balance on a railway track, the monorail is balanced on top of one rail. Monorails are often used to transport people around large cities. Some monorails utilize magnets to hover on their rails, reducing friction between the train and the rail. The first monorail was invented in the 19th Century.
