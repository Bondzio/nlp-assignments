I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! is a television show like "Big Brother" where a group of celebrities get together as they sky dive down to the jungle. For a few weeks, they have to cope with jungle creatures such as snakes, spiders, cockroaches and more. The UK version of the show takes place in Queensland, Australia and airs every November-December on ITV1 in the UK. The presenters are Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.

Evey day, someone has to do a task known as a "bush trucker trial". The public has to vote on which celebrity has to do it apart from in the first two or three days. Sometimes, near the end of the series the celebrities decide who participates in the trail. To make the trials more challenging, they put some creepy crawlies with them. All trials have stars, and they earn stars for meals back at the camp.

Like "Big Brother", the show has a lot of cut scenes. One of them has a spider which catches a bug and spins it around and makes an amusing sound.
