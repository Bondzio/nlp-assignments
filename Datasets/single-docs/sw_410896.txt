Ugni

Ugni is a genus of plants of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae). Four species belong to this genus, all from western America.

They are small evergreen shrubs. The leaves are simple, entire, opposite, elliptical; they are 1–2 cm long and 0.2-2.5 cm broad, dark green, and with a spicy scent if broken into many small pieces.

The solitary flowers are usually hanging; they are 1–2 cm diameter with four or five white or pale pink petals and many short stamens. The fruit is a small red or purple berry, 1 cm in diameter, with many seeds.

The name comes from "Uñi" with which the Mapuches (native people from south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina) name the fruits of the best known species of the genus, "Ugni molinae".

The genus was formerly often included in either "Myrtus" or "Eugenia"; it is distinguished from these two genera by the hanging flowers with stamens shorter than the petals.

The Russian botanist Nicolai Stepanowitsch Turczaninow created the genus "Ugni" in 1849.

All species of this genus are found in western South and Central America, native from southern Mexico to central southern Chile and Argentina.

There are four species in this genus:'

"Ugni molinae" is grown as an ornamental plant and for its edible fruits; these fruits are also used to make jams.
