Vajiralongkorn

Maha Vajiralongkorn (born 28 July 1952) is the King of Thailand since October 13, 2016. He is the only son of former King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. In 1972, the king gave him the title "Somdech Phra Borom Oras Adhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman" and the title made him the Crown Prince and heir apparent to the throne.

After his father's death on 13 October 2016, succeeded to the throne of Thailand, with a delay, saying he needed "time to prepare before being proclaimed as the new king". Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has confirmed that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn will become the new King of Thailand. He accepted the throne on December 1, 2016.

Vajiralongkorn has been married and divorced three times. He has three daughters and five sons. His four eldest sons were born before he married their mother. They are not able to succeed as king, because their titles have been removed.
