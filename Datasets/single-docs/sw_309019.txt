Judaism in Palestine

A Palestinian Jew is a Jewish inhabitant of Palestine (or Land of Israel) at various points in the region's history (see Dispute over usage of the term below). Jews in Palestine prior to the establishment of the State of Israel are more commonly referred to as "Yishuv" (Jewish Community). A distinction is drawn between the "Old Yishuv," that is, the pre-existing Jews in the land of Israel, and the "New Yishuv," that is, the newly-arrived Jewish immigrants after the First Aliyah in 1881. After the modern State of Israel was born in 1948, native Jews in Palestine became citizens of Israel, and the term "Palestinian Jews" largely fell into disuse.
