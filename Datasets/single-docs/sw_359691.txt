WWE 2K

WWE 2K series is a series of video games that are developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts and are published by 2K Sports. The video games are based on the professional wrestling company WWE.

The series was first known as "WWF/WWE SmackDown!" from 2000 to 2004 and then was changed to "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw" in 2004. The title was changed to simply "WWE" in 2011 with the release of WWE '12. The "WWE" title was used for WWE '12 and WWE '13 and was changed to "WWE 2K" when Take Two Interactive acquired the publishing rights for the series from THQ. In Japan, the series was known as "Exciting Pro Wrestling" until 2005. The series has gained positive reviews over the years and is one of the best-selling video game franchises. 

The series was published by THQ from 2000 to 2013 before THQ filed for bankruptcy on December 19, 2012. THQ's assets were auctioned off and the WWE video game's publishing rights were acquired by Take Two Interactive (Parent company of 2K Games).
