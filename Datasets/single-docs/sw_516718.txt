Lofsöngur

Lofsöngur (Icelandic: "Hymn"; also called Ó Guð vors lands which means "O, God of Our Land" in English) is the national anthem of the European country of Iceland. It was written for the celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the first norse settlement of Iceland. But it wasn't considered a nation anthem for another 40 years. The anthem contains three stanzas, but only the first one is usually sung.
