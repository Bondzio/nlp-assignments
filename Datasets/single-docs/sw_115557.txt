Wii Fit

Wii Fit is an exercise video game made by Nintendo for the Wii game console.

"Wii Fit" requires players to use an object called the Wii Balance Board to play. There are many different exercises and games, including yoga moves, sit-ups and jumping jacks, and a ball-rolling game. There is also a meditation game called Lottus focus or Zazen where the player has to sit still for three minutes whilst looking at a flame. Once the game has begun, there will be insects in the background trying to distract the player. There will also be creepy floorboard sound effects and a man clearing his throat in the background. If the player fails to sit still, the flame will burn out.

"Wii Fit Trainer" is a Nintendo character of Wii Fit games. It is available in two versions, male and female. Both the male and female trainers are playable in "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U".

"Wii Fit" was first released on December 1, 2007 in Japan.
