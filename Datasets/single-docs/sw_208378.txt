Heaviside Function

The Heaviside function, "H" is a non-continuous function whose value is zero for negative argument and one for positive argument.

The function is used in the mathematics of control theory to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time and stays switched on indefinitely. It was named after the Englishman Oliver Heaviside.

The Heaviside function is the integral of the Dirac delta function: "H"′ = "δ". This is sometimes written as

We can also define an alternative form of the Heaviside step function as a function of a discrete variable "n":

where "n" is an integer.

Or

The discrete-time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step

This function is the cumulative summation of the Kronecker delta:

where

is the discrete unit impulse function.

Often an integral representation of the Heaviside step function is useful:

The value of the function at 0 can be defined as "H"(0) = 0, "H"(0) = ½ or "H"(0) = 1.
