Tower defense

Tower Defense is a type of game where players use strategy to build towers to help defeat an enemy. In many tower defence games the player's towers must stop an enemy from invading a base. If the towers cannot stop the enemy, the player loses the game.

The first game that was thought to be a tower defense game was "Rampart" . Other games started to be used for tower defense by using tools in the games to change them. Those games were ones like "Starcraft" , "Age of Empires II" , and "Warcraft III" . 

Tower defense games were made by independent developers also. The first game made in Flash was "Flash Element Tower Defense" . The next game was made quickly after and was called "Desktop Tower Defense" . Desktop Tower Defense won an award from the Independent Games Festival.
