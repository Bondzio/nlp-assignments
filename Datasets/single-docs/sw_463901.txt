Republican Governors Association

The Republican Governors Association (RGA) is a Washington, D.C.-based 527 organization founded in 1963. It is about all of the U.S. state and territorial Republican governors.

In 2016 the RGA chairman is Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico, who assumed the office in November 2015, succeeding Governor Bill Haslam of Tennessee. The 2015 RGA Vice Chair is Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who followed current RGA chairman Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico as Vice Chair. The rest of the Executive Committee includes Governors Doug Ducey of Arizona, Mike Pence of Indiana, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Rick Scott of Florida, Bill Haslam of Tennessee, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.

40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, was once president of the RGA when he was Governor of California.

The RGA is not working with the non-partisan National Governors Association.
