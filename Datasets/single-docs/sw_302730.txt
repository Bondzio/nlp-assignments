Arctic hare

The Arctic hare ("Lepus arcticus") is a social animal that lives in the frigid tundra of North America, Newfoundland, and Greenland. These hares often congregate in groups of up to 200 individuals. They hop at great speeds on their large, powerful hind legs, in a kangaroo-like fashion. The female is called a doe, the male is called a buck, and the baby hare is called a leveret. The young are born open-eyed and furry. Most hares live for about a year in the wild. 

This mammal is hunted by wolves and people. The young are preyed upon by Arctic foxes, falcons, snowy owls, and ermine (short-tailed weasels).
