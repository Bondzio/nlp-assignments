Christian Rudolph "Buddy" Ebsen, Jr. (April 2, 1908 â€“ July 6, 2003) was an American dancer, movie, voice, television, radio, and stage actor. He was known for his roles as Jed Clampett in "The Beverly Hillbillies" and as Barnaby Jones in "Barnaby Jones". Ebsen was the oldest voice guest star in television history with his voice role as Chet Elderson in "King of the Hill".

Ebsen was originally cast to play the Scarecrow in "The Wizard of Oz". However, Ray Bolger, who was playing the Tin Man, convinced Ebsen to trade roles for a rehearsal. Ebsen had a very bad allergic reaction to the aluminum dust in the Tin Man's makeup. He had to go to the hospital. He was so sick that Jack Haley replaced him as the Scarecrow.
