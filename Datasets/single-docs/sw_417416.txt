Installation art

Installation art is a style of visual art that uses three-dimensional objects. These artworks are usually meant to change the perception of a space (the way a space is seen). Installation artworks can be permanent or temporary and are shown in museums, galleries or in public spaces.

Some of the earliest installation artworks were Marcel Duchamp's "readymade" objects. However, the real development started in the 1970s. Today, with the improvement of technology, artists use and mix new medias and may involve sensors too in order to make the visitors interact with the installations.
