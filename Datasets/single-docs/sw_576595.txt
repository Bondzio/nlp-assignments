HaMahaneh HaTziyoni

HaMahaneh HaTziyoni, Hebrew: המחנה הציוני‎‎ , meaning "The Zionist Camp" (often called the "The Zionist Union"), is an Israeli political cooperation.

Its ideology is left-wing centrist, and Zionist.

Political leaders are Avi Gabbay (HaAvoda) and Tzipi Livni (HaTnu'a).

HaMaḥaneh HaTziyoni was founded in 2014 as a cooperation of HaAvoda (Israeli Labor Party), HaTnu'a ("The Movement"), and HaTnu'a HaYeruqa ("The Green Movement") in an effort to prevent Likud continuing its governing position after the Knesset elections of 2015.
Because its attempt was unsuccessful, Herzog has become leader of the opposition.

Number of seats in the 20th Knesset: 24 (HaAvoda: 19, HaTnu'a: 4, HaTnu'a HaYeruqa 1).
