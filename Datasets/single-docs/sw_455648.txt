Bandy World Championship for men

The Bandy World Championship is a competition between bandy-playing nations. The tournament is administrated by the Federation of International Bandy.

Bandy has been played since the 19th century, but the first world championship for men were only played in 1957, and the first world championship for women were only played in 2004. 

Bandy was held as a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. This Olympic bandy tournament had no world championship status.

The first ever Bandy World Championship was organised in 1957. It was played at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in Finland.

From 1961-2003, the bandy world championship for men were played once every two years, but since 2003 the bandy world championship for men has been played once every year.
