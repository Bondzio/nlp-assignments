Enhanced Fujita scale

The Enhanced Fujita scale is a tornado category scale used for United States and Canadian tornadoes that began being used by National Weather Service on February 1, 2007 and in Canada in April 2013. The weakest tornadoes on this scale are classified EF0, and the strongest storms are classified EF5. The scale replaces the old Fujita scale in America. Tornadoes under EF5 label represent winds of 200 miles an hour or stronger. No tornadoes that happened prior to February 1, 2007 will receive upgraded ratings for the time being, though some may in the future.
