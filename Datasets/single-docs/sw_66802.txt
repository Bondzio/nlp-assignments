Hepatitis A

Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. Unlike the other common forms of hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), it does not cause chronic (long-term) liver disease.

When a person has hepatitis A, the virus stays in their feces. Hepatitis A is usually spread by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with infected feces. For example, hepatitis A can be spread by:

Hepatitis A can also be spread by having sex with someone who has hepatitis A.


There is no medication that can cure hepatitis A. In most cases, the infection resolves on its own. In most cases, symptoms last less than 2 months, although some people are sick for as long as six months.

Unfortunately, a small number of patients develop Fulminant hepatic failure, which is very serious.

A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A, and anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin is also used.
