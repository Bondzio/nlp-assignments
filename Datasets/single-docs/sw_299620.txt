Asteridae

Asteridae is a Linnaean term with the rank of subclass. By definition it always includes the family Asteraceae (Compositae). However, in the modern APG III system of classification, asterid and euasterid are names for clades. Their member families are similar to those of the Asteridae.

One of the better-known systems that recognized subclass Asteridae was the Cronquist system, which included the orders:


Most of the above orders as defined by Cronquist have been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent molecular systematic studies.
