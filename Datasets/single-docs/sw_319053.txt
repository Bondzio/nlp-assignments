Bohemia at the Olympics

Bohemia took part in some of the early modern Olympic Games. It was an autonomous part of Austria-Hungary until 1918. The team began taking part in the Olympics at the 1900 Summer Olympics. After World War I, Bohemia became part of Czechoslovakia. Bohemian athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics. After Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, Bohemian athletes competed for the Czech Republic at the Olympics. Bohemian athletes have missed only three Olympics: the first in 1896, the 1904 Summer Olympics (the first not to take place in Europe) and the boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics.

Hedwiga Rosenbaumov√° also won a bronze medal with Archibald Warden of Great Britain (GBR) in the mixed doubles event in tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics. This medal is listed as being won by a mixed team instead of split between Bohemia and Great Britain.
