Lead guitar

Lead guitar means the use of a guitar to perform melody lines, instrumental fills, and solos within a song structure.

In rock and metal bands, the lead guitarist is usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar (chords and ). In some rock or metal bands with two guitarists, the two performers may perform as a "guitar tandem", and trade off the lead guitar and rhythm guitar roles, or both guitarists can play the same role ("dual lead guitars" or "dual rhythm guitars").

Musician Lou Reed used an "interlocking" dual guitar style, with the Velvet Underground and on his solo records, where two guitarists would play riffs in different rhythms. The Eagles and other bands also used this style.
