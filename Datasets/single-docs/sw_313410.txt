Pope Benedict IX

Pope Benedict IX (;c. 1012â€“1056), born Teofilatto or Theophylactus of Tusculum, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 146th Pope from 1032 to 1045. He is listed as the 148th Pope in 1045. Also, he was the 151st Pope in 1047-1048.

Teofilatto was born in Rome c. 1012. He was the son of Alberic III of the noble Tusculum family.

He was the nephew of both Pope Benedict VIII and Pope John XIX.

John XIX raised Teofilatto to the rank of a cardinal; but the date is unknown.

In 1032, Alberic III used his money and influence to make his son the pope. This was called simony. Pope Benedict chose his name in honor of his uncle, Benedict VIII. 

Benedict is usually recognized as having had three terms or reigns as pope

Benedict's first period as pope lasted from 1032 to 1044 when a revolt in Rome forced Benedict out of the city; and an antipope was elected with the name of Sylvester III.

Benedict's second period as pope lasted from his return six months later to 1045 when he sold his title to John Gratianus, who was then made pope with the name of Gregory VI. Benedict abdicated or resigned.

In 1046, there were three men with the title of pope. The problem was solved by electing a new pope with the name of Pope Clement II, who died a short time later.

When the death of Clement II in 1047, Benedict IX tried to claim the papacy again, but was driven out of Rome by German troops. The timely election of Pope Damasus II became unimportant when he died 23 days later.

After 1048, Benedict's importance faded; and Pope Leo IX was elected in 1049.

Benedict IX was buried in the Abbey of Grottaferrata c. 1056.
