Cooking Channel

Cooking Channel is a television channel that replaced Fine Living Network from May 31, 2010. The channel is owned by Scripps Networks Interactive, is a spinoff (in association) of Food Network, also owned by SNI, but the channel will focus more on instructional programs than "reality style" and programming competitions that Food Network is now geared towards. The original plan was to implement the change in the fall of 2010, but it was later announced that the switch was being moved up to May 31, 2010 to happen with Memorial Day in the United States. Cooking Channel launched a high-definition feed and channel on June 30, 2010. The channel has also announced it eventually will offer an on demand version.

Many of Food Network's top chefs and celebrities - Emeril Lagasse, Rachael Ray and Bobby Flay - will have new programs on the channel starting in the fall of 2010. Lagasse's new show, called "Emeril's Fresh Food Fast", will show viewers how fresh food can be prepared in a several amount of time without the authentic taste. Flay's new show, called "Bruch @ Bobby's" will focus on Weekend bruches, and Ray's show called "Week In a Day" will show viewers how to plan a week's menu by cooking them all in a single day. The channel will also carry the new "post-game" show for "The Next Food Network Star".
