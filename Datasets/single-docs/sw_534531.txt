Flint water crisis

The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan. It began in April 2014. When Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water to the Flint River, it created a serious public health danger. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. They may experience serious health problems. The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has killed 10 people in the county.

On January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency for Flint. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency. He authorized additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security almost two weeks later.
