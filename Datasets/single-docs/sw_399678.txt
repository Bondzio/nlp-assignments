Comedy hip hop

Comedy hip hop (or Comedy rap) is a musical genre that combines hip hop and rapping with humor. While gangsta rap came with its dark and violent themes in the 1990s, comedy rap came with its very light and very humorous themes in the 1980s. Some notable artists include Eminem and Weird Al Yankovic. While very few rappers make comedy rap their focus, it still keeps its royalties with hip-hop.
