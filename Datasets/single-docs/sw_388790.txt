Invader Zim

Invader Zim, branded as Invader ZIM, is an American cartoon series that was created by comic artist Jhonen Vasquez for Nickelodeon. The series started on March 30, 2001 and was cancelled on December 10, 2002. The show centers around Zim (voice by Richard Horviz), an extraterrestrial being from the planet Irk, who inhabitants participate in an event called "Impending Doom". After failing it miserably, Zim is determined to prove himself to his leaders, the almighty tallest and conquer earth. However, the tallest only sent him to his planet as a "secret mission" only to get rid of him. The series had cost too much to air and the age demographic was aimed toward preteens, but not many were watching the show. Nickelodeon then cancelled the show on January 17, 2002, allowing the remainder of Season 1 to air and "The Most Horrible X-mas Ever" at the series finale.

The series is about an alien from the Irken race known as Zim. He was sent to a "mysterious planet", because the Tallest tried to get rid of him after he ruined Operation Impending Doom I. They then rekindled the event and entitled it as Operation Impending Doom II. They sent Zim six months from Irk.

Six months later, Zim coincidentally found a planet named Earth, assuming it was the "mysterious planet" the Tallest had mentioned.
