Escherichia coli

Escherichia coli or E. coli is a bacterium that can be found in human intestines. Scientists have studied "E. coli" very extensively, and know more about how "E. coli" cells work than any other organism. "E. coli" is not always harmful. In fact, the only known harmful strand is O157.

"E. coli" normally grow in soil and in the large intestines of many mammals, including humans. Most strains of "E. coli" do not cause disease, but instead help animals get vitamins and digest food. Some strains of "E. coli" cause sickness in people. "E. coli" are not usually in food or water. When food has not been prepared with clean equipment, "E. coli" can grow in the food. When "E. coli" are found in water, this may mean that the water has touched sewage. 

It is named after Theodor Escherich, who discovered it in 1885. It was officially named after him in 1919.

The following signs and symptoms of an "E. coli" infection normally happen within three days; however, some people may carry the infection and show no signs at all.

The best treatment for "E. coli" is plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
