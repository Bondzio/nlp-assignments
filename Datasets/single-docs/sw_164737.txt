Tropical Storm Hanna (2002)

Tropical Storm Hanna was the eighth tropical storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Hanna mainly affected Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Hanna killed 3 people and left $20 million in damage. 
Because the damage was rather low the name Hanna wasn't retired. Hanna was used again in 2008.
