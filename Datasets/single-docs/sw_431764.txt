Seal of Louisiana

The Great Seal of the State of Louisiana is an emblem that represents the U.S. state of Louisiana. It was adopted in 1902.

It has four pelicans (one adult, the other three are little). Mother Pelican wounds her breast to feed her young. "Union, justice, confidence" are the words of the motto surrounding these four pelicans.

The wording "State of Louisiana" is on the outer edge of the seal.
