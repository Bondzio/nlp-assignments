Radical Face

Radical Face is a musical act whose main member is Ben Cooper, who sings and plays multiple instruments. All the sounds are put together on a computer. Cooper is also in Electric President, an electronic music group. However, Radical Face has an acoustic sound.

Radical Face's music has been on television programmes and in the movie "Wish I Was Here".

Cooper's first album to be recorded under the name Radical Face was "The Junkyard Chandelier" (2003). The album was never released. However, it can be downloaded for free online. "Ghost" was the first official studio album, released in March 2007.

On November 16, 2010, Cooper released an EP titled "Touch The Sky". It was a preview for a trilogy of albums called "Family Tree". This trilogy is about a fictional family from the 1800s, the Northcotes. It is also really about Cooper's own life. The albums are "The Roots", "The Branches", and "The Leaves".

Another EP, "The Bastards: Volume One", was released before "The Roots". In August 2011, iTunes accidentally released "The Roots" to users outside of the US. It was released in the US on October 4, 2011.

"The Family Tree: The Branches" was released on October 22, 2013 in America and on November 1 in Europe. "The Bastards: Volume Two" was also released that year.

"The Bastards: Volume Three" and "The Bastards: Volume Four" were both released in 2015, before the release of "The Family Tree: The Leaves" in March 2016. "The Leaves" has songs that are about Cooper's own life.

"Clone", an album by Ben Cooper and Richard Colado, was supposed to be released before fall of 2012, but it kept getting delayed. The first track of the album, "The Laboratory", was finally released on September 23, 2014. Cooper then released one track per week.
