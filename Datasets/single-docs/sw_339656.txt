Diarchy

Diarchy (or dyarchy) is a form of government where two people are the heads of state. The word comes from the Greek "δι-" "twice" and "αρχια", "rule". Most times the diarchs have the job for life. Rule is passed to children or family.

Modern examples are Andorra, the Republic of San Marino and the Kingdom of Swaziland.
