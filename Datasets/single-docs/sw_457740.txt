The music video shows Katy Perry inside a cargo plane with another male that suddenly crashes in a jungle. Her male counterpart doesn't care about the situation and gives Katy the luggage while taking selfies . A tiger acts him suddenly . Katy screams and flees with the tiger chasing after her she ditches the tiger and is nearly eaten by a crocodile and has a spider crawl on her . After this Katy sees fireflies in the bushes who all come out and form a tiger . It cuts to the next shot wear she bathes with help from an elephant and makes. friends with a money. She also turns berries into lipstick and uses her shoe to make a hunting tool . She catches a banana and then goes exploring .She reads prehistoric cave art with a tiger's roar being stronger than men . He then emerges in different clothes and a leaf skirt and starts swing from vines and brushes a crocodiles teeth and also she paints an elephant's toe nails . She calls all the animals and uses a parrots feather to lure the tiger into a trap and proves her roar stronger than his . Katy is then named queen of the jungle with her tiger and various animals as her pets . The next shot cuts to her waking up in the crashed plane surrounded by animals .
