Flag of Algeria

The national flag of Algeria has two equal vertical bars, green and white. In the center is a red star and crescent. The white color is for peace. Green is for the beauty of nature. Red is for the blood of those killed fighting for independence in the Algerian War (1954 to 1962). The star and crescent are for Islam.
