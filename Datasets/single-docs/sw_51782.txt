Lilac (colour)

Lilac is a light violet colour. It is named after the colour of the lilac flower. The actual colour of the flowers of the plant may range from the colour of the lilac flowers shown at left to a richer or deeper colour. These colours, such as "rich lilac" and "deep lilac", are shown in the colour chart below.

The first written use of "lilac" as a colour name in English was in 1775.


Some lilac flowers are coloured tones of lilac and other lilac flowers are coloured tones of red-violet. Those lilac flowers that are coloured red-violet are said to be coloured Persian lilac. Therefore, two different colour comparison charts are provided.
