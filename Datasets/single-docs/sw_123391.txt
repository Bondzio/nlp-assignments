Pubic hair

Pubic hair is that which covers the area around the sex organs. It is generally darker in color and stronger in texture than other hair found on the human body. It is caused by the rising levels of androgen during puberty. Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic.

Pubic hair appears during puberty in girls and boys. Beginning with only a few hairs, the area quickly fills out in a triangular shape making a thick patch of hair. 

The growth of hair can go up toward the navel, but will always continue to grow down past the pubic region and ending at the anus (the hole between the buttocks). In females hair will cover the outer lips of the vagina; in males hair will grow around the base of the penis and lightly cover the scrotum (the outer sack containing the testicles).

Pubic hair is sometimes called a "bush," "nest," "pubes," or "curlies". On Asian people, pubic hair is usually not so curly.

Pubic hair is sometimes made into a fashion item. Men and women do this. Some people may change the way their pubic hair looks, by trimming or shaping it. One style is called a landing strip, like a runway where an airplane lands. Some religions say to shave pubic hair. Some people use chemicals that dissolve pubic hair. Some people use wax or electrolysis to remove pubic hair. Use of wax to remove all pubic hair is sometimes called "Brazilian".

Sometimes people change the color. Sometimes people ask, "Does the carpet match the drapes?" This means, "Is the person's pubic hair the same color as the hair on the person's head?" Usually people with red natural hair color have darker red pubic hair.
