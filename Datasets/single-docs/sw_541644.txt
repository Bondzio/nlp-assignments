The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is a painting by John Martin (1789-1854). Martin painted it in 1852. 

John Martin was famous for painting landscapes in the style of Romanticism. He painted pictures of the end of the world and events from the Bible. 

"The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah" was the last painting that Martin finished. He completed it in 1852 and sent it to the Royal Academy. In 1853 he started to paint "The Last Judgment", "The Great Day of His Wrath", and "The Plains of Heaven", but he became sick. He died the next year.

The painting shows the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah from the Bible. The picture shows Lot and his two daughters running from the city. Lot's wife looked back and became a pillar of salt. The painting has a red color and a storm in the sky, typical of Martin's work. 

"The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah" is in the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle, England.
