Hyundai Santa Fe

Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid sized crossover utility vehicle sold by the South Korean automaker Hyundai. It was introduced in 2002 as a mid sized SUV. It initially replaced the Hyundai Galloper (a badge engineered Mitsubishi Pajero). Beginning in 2007 it was redesigned as a unibody frame crossover utility vehicle. It slots above both the compact Hyundai Tucson and mid sized Hyundai Veracruz. In 2013 the vehicle was given a long wheel-base trim allowing third row seating, replacing the Veracruz in many countires (however it is still produced in South Korea)
