Y chromosome

The Y chromosome is a chromosome that decides the sex in most mammals, including humans. It contains the gene "SRY", which triggers testis development, so making an animal male or female.

Normal females have two X chromosomes, and normal males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans.
