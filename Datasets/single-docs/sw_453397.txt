Dyatlov Pass incident

The Dyatlov Pass incident is an unsolved mystery to the deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. The incident happened on the east shoulder of the mountain Kholat Syakhl (Холат-Сяхыл, a Mansi name, meaning Dead Mountain). The mountain pass where the incident occurred has since been named "Dyatlov Pass" (Перевал Дятлова) after the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov (Игорь Дятлов). To this day, the incident has not been solved.

Only one hiker who left the group before the event happened survived. Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.

There are many conspiracy theories towards what killed the hikers. Many Russians believe that a local tribe called the Mansi people killed them for trespassing on their property. Others believe that the military had something to do with their death. High levels of radiation was found on their clothing so some believe that a missile misfired and crashed nearby the hikers.

Investigators at the time discovered that the hikers tore open their tent from inside, ran barefoot into heavy snow and a temperature of . Although the corpses showed no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing parts of her face such as her tongue.
