Sooty Barbthroat

The Sooty Barbthroat ("Threnetes niger") is a species of hummingbird. It is found in French Guiana and far north-eastern Brazil. Its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest. Though normally restricted in range, it is common enough to be thought a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.

The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion. Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a "melanistic variant" of the Pale-tailed Barbthroat ("T. leucurus").

Not only that, but some suggest that the Bronze-tailed Barbthroat ("T. n. loehkeni") should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina's Barbthroat ("T. n. christinae") as a subspecies. Freire's Sooty Barbthroat (T. n. freirei) is average between the Sooty and Bronze-tailed Barbthroats however, and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed.
