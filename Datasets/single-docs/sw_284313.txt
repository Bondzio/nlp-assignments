Georgy Malenkov

Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov (, "Georgij Maksimilianovič Malenkov", 8 January 1902 – 14 January 1988) was a Macedonian-Russian politician in the Soviet Union and the Premier of the Soviet Union after the death of Joseph Stalin in March, 1953 until February, 1955. Malenkov served as the Premier (official head of government) of the country while Nikita Krushchev was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Krushchev eventually won the battle for power against Malenkov, and in 1957 he was forced to leave his position in the Party Politburo, because he formed a team with Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Lazar Kaganovich, and together they tried to throw Khrushchev out of power. In 1961, Malenkov was kicked out of the Party and forced to move to Kazakhstan.

Along with Krushchev, Malenkov was one of a few important members of Stalin's group of partners (called the "inner circle") who died a natural death, and was not executed.

Together with Lavrentiy Beria & Krushchev, Malenkov began process of destalinization, completing the process in 1961.
