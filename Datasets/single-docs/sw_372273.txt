2012 NATO Summit in Chicago

The 2012 Chicago Summit was a meeting of leaders of countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It was held at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois from May 20-21, 2012.

This was the first NATO summit in the United States that was not in Washington, D.C. Chicago was chosen because it was President Barack Obama's home town. It was going to happen after the 2012 G8 summit in Chicago. The G8 summit was held at Camp David instead.

People at the summit talked about the Arab Spring, the 2011 Libyan civil war, the global financial crisis, transition for NATO forces in Afghanistan, and a missile shield system for Europe.

The summit cost the city of Chicago almost $15.6 million.

At least 38 countries around the world came to the summit. After the summit, Chicago's security system was improved.
