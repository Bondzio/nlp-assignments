Eucalyptus dives

Eucalyptus dives or broad-leaved peppermint is a small tree found in the temperate dry sclerophyll woodlands and forests of south-eastern Australia. The leaves have a strong peppermint smell.

The leaves have a high oil content, about 4.7% of the leaf fresh weight. When the oil is distilled it can be used to produce methanol. The major producing region is eastern Transvaal, South Africa, where it is grown in commercial plantations. The leaves have also been used as a flavouring in Australia, especially in brewed black "Camellia sinensis" 'billy tea'.
