Echo and Narcissus

Echo and Narcissus is a story of Ovids Metamorphoses which tells about Echo and Narcissus. Echo was a an Oread, a mountain nymph. Zeus had given her the task of entertaining Hera with stories, so that he would have free time for amorous adventures. When Hera noticed this plot, she took away Echo's speech. Echo was only able to repeat the last few words addressed to her. Narcissus is a beautiful youth, and Echo falls in love with him. Because of her curse, she is unable to tell him. One day, Narcissus went hunting, and Echo followed him. When he got separated from the others, he was finally able to exchange a few words with him (she always repeated the last few words he said). When she steps out of the woods with open arms, he refused her though. Forever unhappy, she retreated, and starved, until only her voice was left. Later, Nemesis punished Narcissus. Since he did not want the love of Echo, Nemesis made him fall in love with his own reflection he saw in a pond.
