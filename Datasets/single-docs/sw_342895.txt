In the Wake of the Bounty

In the Wake of the Bounty is an Australian movie directed by Charles Chauvel. It is the first movie of Errol Flynn. It is based on the 1932 novel "Mutiny on the Bounty" by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. The Australian movie was made two years before MGM's more famous "Mutiny on the Bounty".

The movie mixed re-enactments with documentary. It focused not so much on the mutiny itself as on what happened afterwards.
