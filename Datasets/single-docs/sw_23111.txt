Alderney

Alderney is one of the Channel Islands in the English Channel between England and France. It forms part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, but its parliament, The States of Alderney, still has the right to make laws for the island.

The traditional language was Auregnais, but nobody speaks it now.

During World War II Alderney was used to house four concentration camps by the Germans, who had occupied each of the Channel Islands.
