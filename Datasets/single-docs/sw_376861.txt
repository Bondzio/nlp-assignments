List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: G–L

This is a complete alphabetical list (G to L) of Medal of Honor recipients during the American Civil War. Many of the medals presented during the Civil War were for capturing or saving regimental flags. At that time regimental flags served as the rallying point for the unit. They guided the unit's movements and loss of the flag could greatly disrupt a unit. Getting the flag could have a greater effect than the death of the commanding officer.

The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself "…conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States…". Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the individual dies (posthumously).
