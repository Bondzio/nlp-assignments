Sock puppet (internet)

A sockpuppet is a false identity used on the Internet intended to hide a person's real identity. Another word to describe a sock puppet would be alter ego. Often a sock puppet identity is used to promote ideas or gather intelligence anonymously. Very often they are used by individuals on the Internet praising themselves while pretending to be someone else. Politicians have frequently been accused of using sock puppets. sockpuppets are designed to create political mischief (making fun of an opponent's position for example). It can make it appear many people hold a certain opinion, when in fact that is false. Many online communities attempt to block sockpuppets.

The term "sockpuppet" was used as early as July 9, 1993. By 1996 it was in general use. The "Oxford English Dictionary" at first defined it as "a person whose actions are controlled by another". In 2000 the U.S. News and World Report associated the word minion with a sock puppet. In 2006, an aide to a Republican congressman was caught posting messages on Democratic Party sites. Using a false identity the aide was trying to convince Democrats not to support a certain candidate.





A meatpuppet is similar to a sockpuppet, except a person joins users to a website, such as Wikipedia, to be used with sockpuppet behaviors. Such users are actually real individuals that come to support another user.
