2016 Cascade Mall shooting

On September 23, 2016, five people were killed in a mass shooting at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, U.S. 

The gunman was identified as Arcan Cetin, a 20-year-old who emigrated from Turkey as a child with his family. He was arrested the following day in Oak Harbor, Washington, his hometown. On September 26, he confessed to committing the shooting.

Shortly before 7:00Â p.m. PDT on the same day, Cetin walked into a Macy's store at the Cascade Mall with a stolen rifle and opened fire, killing four women and one man. The male victim died the next day at a Seattle hospital.
