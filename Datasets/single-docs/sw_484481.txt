Schwerte

Schwerte is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. About 48,000 people live there. Schwerte is in the Ruhr valley just north of the mountainous Sauerland region. The Ruhr river runs through the center of Schwerte. Schwerte is a popular cycling destination for tourists.

Schwerte received civic rights in the 12th century. It was a member of the medieval Hanseatic League. During World War II Schwerte housed a branch of the Buchenwald concentration camp. The camp held 710 prisoners. 

In 2015 Schwerte officials have proposed housing refugees at the site of the former concentration camp. The plan has been criticized as a bad idea by many Germans including the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia. Officials say the buildings were built after the war and should not be a problem. Refugees coming to Germany include those from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Kosovo and Serbia.
