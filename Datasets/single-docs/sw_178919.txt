Tab (GUI)

On computers using graphics for an interface, a tab is a way to switch between different controls (such as in a configuration screen), or documents (such as in a web browser or word processor). Only one tab can be active at a time.

More recently tabs have become a popular feature of most web browsers. This allows you to have more than one website open in the same window.
