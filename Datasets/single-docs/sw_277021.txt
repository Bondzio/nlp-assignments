You Don't Love Me Anymore

"You Don't Love Me Anymore" is an original song by "Weird Al" Yankovic. It was released for "Off the Deep End" in 1992. It is written as a soft ballad, but describes Yankovic and an unnamed girl's relationship. The couple were in love, but the girl has tried to kill Yankovic many times. She had done things like poison his coffee, leaving him for dead in a ditch, and put a cobra in his underwear drawer. The humor in this song is the lyrics and the delivery.
