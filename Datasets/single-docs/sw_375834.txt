United States presidential election, 1956

This election was between Incumbent United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower/Vice President Richard Nixon and former Governor of Illinois Adlai Stevenson/Running mate Estes Kefauver. 

Incumbent president Dwight D. Eisenhower won the election by 457 electoral votes. Adlai Stevenson got 73 electoral votes. Walter Burgwyn Jones got one vote by a faithless elector in Alabama.

This was the last election when Alaska and Hawaii were not states. It did not include Washington, D.C. until the 1964 election.

Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in September 1955 while in Colorado for a vacation. His doctors told him not to run for another election. However, his doctors told him he was feeling better. Eisenhower announced his re-election by an announcement on television in early 1956.
