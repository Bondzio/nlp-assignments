Altiphrynoides

Altiphrynoides is a genus of toads. They are commonly called Ethiopian toads. They only live in the highlands of south-central Ethiopia in the Arussi, Bale, and Sidamo provinces. Both species are threatened by habitat loss. They used to be included in "Nectophrynoides". Now they are separate because they lay eggs, while "Nectophrynoides" give birth to fully developed young.
