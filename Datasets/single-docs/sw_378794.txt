Pokémon X and Y

Pokémon X and Y are two role-playing games (RPGs) in the "Pokémon" series made by Game Freak for the Nintendo 3DS. 

The games were announced by Nintendo on January 8, 2013. They were released on October 12, 2013. "X and Y" are the first ever 3D games in the main "Pokémon" series.

New starting Pokémon were revealed in the announcement video for the game. The starters for "X and Y" are the Grass-type Pokémon, Chespin, the Fire-type Pokémon, Fennekin, and the Water-type Pokémon, Froakie. The announcement video also showed two new legendary Pokémon, Yveltal, a bird-like Pokémon which has a shape kind of like the letter Y, and Xerneas, a deer-like Pokémon which has X-shapes in its eyes. Another Pokémon, Sylveon, is both a new Eevee evolution and an entirely new type called the Fairy-type, which is strong against Dragon-type Pokémon. Some older Pokémon, like Jigglypuff, Marill, and Gardevoir, have also been changed to be part Fairy-type. There is also a new gameplay element called Mega Evolution. Some Pokémon like Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Lucario are able to power up during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. Mega forms of Pokémon are stronger than their normal forms.
