Waltz of the Flowers

The "Waltz of the Flowers" (1892) is a piece of orchestral music from the second act of "The Nutcracker", a ballet composed by Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky told his fellow musicians he was working on a "fantastic" ballet called "The Nutcracker": "It's awfully fun to write a march for tin soldiers, a waltz of the flowers, etc." The waltz is also the last number in his "Nutcracker Suite". The "Waltz of the Flowers" is very popular. It has been arranged for various instruments and for various combinations of instruments. Percy Grainger arranged the waltz for piano solo as "Paraphrase on Tchaikovskyâ€™s Flower Waltz". Walt Disney Studios animated the waltz for the movie "Fantasia".
