Quantitative easing

Quantitative easing (QE) is something a central bank can do to help the economy. It is done by buying bonds or other assets. With this, the interest rate will decrease and the rate of inflation will go up.

QE is used by the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. It has helped to cause a bull market on stock exchanges.
