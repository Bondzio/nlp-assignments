Lathe

A lathe is a type of machine used mostly to create parts for things in areas such as woodturning, metalworking, metal spinning, spin welding and glassworking. A lathe works by holding an object in place while it is being rotated on an axle. A worker would then create something while it is held in place.

Examples of objects that can be made using a lathe are, candlestick holders, gun barrels, cue sticks and baseball bats.
