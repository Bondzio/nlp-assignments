Nu metal

Nu metal is a style of metal music that uses elements of hip hop and heavy metal music, as well as the normal heavy metal instruments such as guitars, drums and bass. Nu metal bands often include electronic instruments such as DJ decks and keyboards. Nu metal was very successful in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nu metal bands such as Linkin Park (with more than 50 million records sold around the world), Korn (with 35 million), Deftones, Limp Bizkit (with 35 million) and Slipknot (around 15 million records) had been the most important bands that made successful this genre.
