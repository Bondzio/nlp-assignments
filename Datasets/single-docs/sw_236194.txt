Asuka period

The , sometimes called "Suikochō-jidai" ("period of the Suiko court"), was a time in the history of Japan which lasted from around 538 through about 710. There is some overlap with the Kofun period which came before. There is also some overlap with the Nara period which comes after. 

The Asuka period is named after the Asuka region, about 25 km south to the modern city of Nara.
