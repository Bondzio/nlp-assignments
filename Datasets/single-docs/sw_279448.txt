On land, Vorarlberg has borders with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Germany. The respextive states are the Swiss cantons of St.Gallen and Graubünden, and the German state of Bavaria. Lake Constance is special, there are no borders apart fro the borders on land. Legally, all the states that share this lake, also have a common border. That way, Vorarlberg also has a common border with the German state of Baden-Württemberg, and the Swiss canton of Thurgau.
