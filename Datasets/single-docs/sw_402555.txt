Plymouth Rock

Plymouth Rock is the traditional site where the "Mayflower" Pilgrims stepped ashore in the New World in 1620. It is an important symbol in American history. Edward Winslow did not mention the rock in "Mourt's Relation" (1620–1621). William Bradford did not mention it in his journal "Of Plymouth Plantation" (1620–1647). The first written reference to the Pilgrims landing on a rock is found 121 years after they landed. The rock has been memorialized in Plymouth, Massachusetts for a long time.
