Papilioninae

Papilioninae is a subfamily of butterflies. It belongs in the family Papilionidae. The species are found worldwide.

The caterpillars feed on plants in the following families: Rosaceae, Apiaceae, Aristolochiaceae, Magnoliaceae, Lauraceae, and Annonaceae. Caterpillars that feed on Aristolochiaceae species become poisonous. When they become adults, they are still poisonous. Because of this, many butterflies in the families Papilionidae and Nymphalidae mimic Aristolochiaceae feeders.

Very few adult Papilioninae species migrate. They spend the winter as chrysailds.
