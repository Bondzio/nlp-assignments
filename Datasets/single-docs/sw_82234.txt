A group of contestants are chosen to live together in the Top Model House and compete to become America's Next Top Model. Each week, one girl is asked to leave (called 'elimination') because she does not have the standard and ability to become a top model. The elimination is based on a photoshoot or a commercial and the reward challenge is different every week. The last few girls travel to another country (France, Italy, Japan, China, Thailand etc.) to continue the competition. Near the end, they will do a CoverGirl commercial. Then, the last girls appear in a final runway show against each other. The winner is then chosen by the group of judges that includes Tyra Banks and others.
