CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala

The CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala (formerly Sabena Flight Academy Africa) (CAE SFA-A) is an aviation school (part of CAE Global Academy). It is in Douala, Cameroon. It was the first civil aviation university in Cameroon.

The school was a subsidiary of Sabena Flight Academy. It trains pilots, flight attendants (preparation of the "Certificat de formation à la sécurité") and flight dispatchers.

The school was created in 2008 by Joseph Barla, Jean-Yves Kotto and Sabena Flight Academy. That is why the name of the school was originally Sabena Flight Academy Africa. A few months later, after Canadian group CAE took over Sabena Flight Academy, SFA-A was also bought. It became part of CAE Global Academy and was renamed CAE Global Academy Douala.
