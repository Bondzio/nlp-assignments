Malakunanja II

Malakunanja II is a rock shelter in Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is about 50 kms from the coast. Archaeologists discovered that people have been living in the protection of the rock for at least 60,000 years.. This is the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia. More than 1500 items have been found in the shelter, including stone tools and grinding stones, ochre, and charcoal. Some of these were buried more than 2.5 metres below the surface. The shelter also includes faded paintings on the walls. The paintings are drawn with ochre.
