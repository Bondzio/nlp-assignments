John McEnroe

John McEnroe (born February 16, 1959) is an American retired tennis player. He became a professional in 1978.

He won three times at Wimbledon and four times at the U.S. Open. He is remembered for getting angry at the umpire very easily and his rivalries with players such Bj√∂rn Borg. He is probably also famous for his "You cannot be serious!" rant directed to an umpire in 1981 at Wimbledon.
