Crispin Glover

Crispin Hellion Glover (born April 20, 1964) is an American actor. He has acted in such movies as "Back to the Future", "Epic Movie" (where he did a parody of the Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp) and the "Open Season" series as Fifi. 

In the late 1980s, Glover started his company, Volcanic Eruptions. The company publishes his books and also is the production company for his movies, "What Is It?" and "It is Fine. Everything is Fine!".

Glover has written between 15 and 20 books. He makes the books by reusing old novels and other publications which are in the public domain due to their age. He rearranges text, blacks out certain standing passages, and adds his own prose and sometimes images.
