Pat Boone

Charles Eugene "Pat" Boone (born June 1, 1934 in Jacksonville, Florida) is an American singer, writer and actor. He was a very successful pop musician in the 1950s and 1960s. His many hits were covers of black R&B musicians' songs. At that time black musicians were not played on white radio stations. His daughter Debby is also a singer.

According to "Billboard", Boone was the second biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley. He is a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

Boone hosted a half-hour ABC variety television series. There were 115 episodes from 1957 to 1960. Many musical performers, including Edie Adams, Andy Williams, Pearl Bailey and Johnny Mathis were on the show.
