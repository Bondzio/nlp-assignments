Casualty (person)

A casualty in military usage is a person in military service, who becomes unavailable for duty due to death or injury. It also includes illness, capture, desertion, etc.; or a civilian casualty.

In civilian usage the word "casualty" is properly used for a person who is killed, wounded or injured by some event. It is usually used to describe multiple deaths and injuries due to violent incidents or disasters. "Casualties" is sometimes loosely used to mean "fatalities", but non-fatal injuries are also casualties.
