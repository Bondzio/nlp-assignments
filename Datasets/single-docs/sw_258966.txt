Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was announced in early 2007 at the Abu Dhabi F1 Festival in the United Arab Emirates. The first race took place on November 1 2009. It was held at the Yas Marina Circuit. Hermann Tilke designed the circuit.

The race was Formula One's first ever day-night race, starting at 5:00 pm local time. The floodlights used to light the circuit were turned on for the start of the race. This was to ensure even lighting during the transition from daylight to darkness.

The Yas Marina Circuit is located on Yas Island. Yas Island is a island on the east coast of Abu Dhabi. The 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the first major event to take place on the circuit.
