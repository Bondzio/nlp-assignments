Minka (actress)

MINKA

I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea. Received a scholarship to play tennis from my university. I graduated from college and came to the USA in 1993 to teach tennis. I was playing in the Asian Olympics in Chicago in 1993 and I won the gold in women's doubles. I sent a polaroid picture to John Graham in England and two weeks later I had my ticket to England. He immediately called Universal Entertainment and as soon as I got back to the USA I started receiving bookings in clubs all over the USA. The rest is history.
