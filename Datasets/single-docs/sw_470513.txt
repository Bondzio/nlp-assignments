Incineration

Incineration is a form of waste disposal in which waste is burnt. Incineration converts the waste into ash, flue gas, and heat. 

The first incinerators for waste disposal were built in Nottingham by Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. in 1874. They were originally known as destructors. The first incinerator in the US was built in 1885 on Governors Island in New York, NY.
