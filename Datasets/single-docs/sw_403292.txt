Acrylic paint

Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint containing pigment in an acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but are water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique appearance.

Acrylic paint can give a much brighter, more vivid colour than oil paints. It has been much used in modern art, and is cheaper than oil paint, which is rather an expensive material. When dry, acrylic paint usually cannot be removed from a solid surface. 

In 1934, a German chemical company created acrylic resin. It was first used in the 1940s. Acrylics were commercially available as paint for artists in the 1950s. Later, many advances were made to acrylic paint as more and more people began using it.
