Pole vault

Pole vault is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible stick (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to leap over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, as well as the Cretans and Celts. It has been a full medal event at the Olympics since the Summer Olympics at 1896 for men and 2000 for women. It started in the ancient Greece.
