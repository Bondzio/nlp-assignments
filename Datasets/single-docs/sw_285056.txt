Alaska North Slope

The Alaska North Slope is a region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is on the northern slope of the Brooks Range along the coast of the. Arctic Ocean. 

The North Slope is known for having lots of oil. The "National Petroleum Reserveâ€“Alaska" and the "Prudhoe Bay Oil Field" are the two biggest areas where oil is found. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is there also, and there has been a lot of debate about drilling for oil there. The oil from the North Slope is pumped south in pipes, called the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, to Valdez where it is loaded onto ships.

Because it gets so cold that far north only the very top of soil, called "tundra" thaws each season; most of the soil is frozen all the time. On top of this permafrost, water flows to in shallow braided streams. Some of it goes into ponds.
