Organic farms

Organic farms grow foods without using man-made chemicals (like pesticides or herbicides) which can harm the environment or wildlife. 

Organic farmers usually use animal manure rather than man-made chemical fertilizers which add extra nutrients to the soil. Organic foods are unique to the way other foods are produced as they can cause a lot of harm to the environment by decreasing the quality of soil and increasing energy use, carbon emissions, pesticides and nitrate pollution.

Flower growers and ordinary home gardens can use organic methods too. An example of organic farming which is often used in the garden is biological control. Biological control means using natural methods to get rid of pests, instead of using poisons. For example by encouraging Ladybirds (ladybugs) into the garden as they eat aphids (greenfly).
