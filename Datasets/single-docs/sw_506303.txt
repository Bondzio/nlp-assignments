Fu Manchu

Dr Fu Manchu is a fictional character in novels by British author Sax Rohmer during the first half of the 20th century. 

The character was also featured extensively in cinema, television, radio, comic strips and comic books for over 90 years He has become an archetype of the evil genius. 

The author's description of him was:

A master criminal, Fu Manchu's murderous plots are marked by a use of biological warfare; he disdains guns or explosives, preferring dacoits, thuggee, and members of other secret societies as his agents armed with knives, or using "pythons and cobras ... fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli ... my black spiders" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons.

In the earliest books, Fu Manchu is an agent of the secret society, the "Si-Fan". and is the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Western imperialists. In later books, he seeks control of the Si-Fan. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and white slavery. Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the "elixir vitae" (elixir of life), a formula he spent decades trying to perfect.

Fu Manchu is opposed by a typical English detective of the Sherlock Holmes type: Denis Nayland Smith. Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan, and aiding his enemies within and outside of the organisation. Her real name is unknown; Fah lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment.
