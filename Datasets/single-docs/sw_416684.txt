Jeux d'enfants

Jeux d'enfants () is a set of 12 piano duets by Georges Bizet. The set was published in 1871. The pieces describe children's toys and games. The set was later orchestrated. George Balanchine made two ballets based on the music. He used the whole set for a ballet in 1955. He used a few pieces for "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" in 1975.
