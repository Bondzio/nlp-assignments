Kingdom of Sardinia

The Kingdom of Sardinia was a monarchy that ruled the Italian island of Sardinia. It was established in 1324. It was given to the House of Habsburg. They were eventually forced to give it to the House of Savoy. Since the House of Savoy also ruled Piedmont, the Kingdom was sometimes referred to as Sardinia-Piedmont. The Savoy family ruled from 1720 till 1861 when Italy officially united itself. Under the Savoy family, the capital of the state was Turin. The territory also included the city and surrounding land of Genoa. In Italian it was known as the "Regno di Sardegna".

The kingdom was originally made up of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. Sovereignty over both of those was claimed by the Popes. While under Spanish rule, the state was ruled by viceroys.
