Anti-abortion movement

The anti-abortion movement is support for the opinion that abortion is wrong. Another word for this movement is pro-life (meaning support for life). Such people think that abortion is wrong and that the law should not allow it. People who think the law should let women decide whether to have abortions are called "pro-choice".

People who are pro-life believe that all humans, including the unborn, have a right to life. For this reason, they believe abortion is wrong and that it is murder. They think the law should make abortion a crime in order to protect embryos and fetuses. Most believe that an unborn baby is a living person as soon as it has been conceived. Many pro-life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should look for alternatives to abortion such as adoption. Some pro-life people think that abortion is okay in some conditions such as rape or incest.

There are many advocacy groups that want to help women considering abortion, and try to convince more people that abortion is wrong.

Being anti-abortion is most associated with conservative politics. In a Gallup poll 66% of conservatives called themselves pro-life. It is also associated with Catholicism. Pope Francis has said that "Every child that isn't born, but is unjustly condemned to be aborted, has the face of Jesus Christ, has the face of the Lord."
