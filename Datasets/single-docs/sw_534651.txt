Victory Day

Victory Day (also shortened as "V-Day") is a common name of many different public holidays in various countries. In most cases it is to commemorate victories in important battles or wars in the countries' history. For example, in Russia, it is celebrated on May 9th for the defeat of Nazi Germany in what Russia calls "The Great Patriotic War" (World War II). For the United States and Britain, the victory in Europe (celebrated as Victory in Europe Day or V-E Day) was only part of the victory. It is celebrated on May 8th (May 7th in the United Kingdom). The war in the Pacific did not end for the US and Britain until the Japanese surrender on Sept. 2, 1945. This is celebrated as Victory over Japan Day or V-J Day. This part of the war is usually not studied by Russians. In France, their Victory Day also celebrated the end of World War II and is celebrated on May 8, 1945, when Charles de Gaulle announced the end of the war.
