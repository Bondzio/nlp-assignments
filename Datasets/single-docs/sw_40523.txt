Corrosion

Corrosion is the breakdown of materials due to reactions. It is usually oxidation with air molecules and often in the presence of water. Corrosion also occurs when an acidic or basic material touches another material. When a material corrodes, it changes and becomes weaker. Materials that corrode include metal, plastic, and wood. Also, corrosion is a form of erosion.

One form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes, which under certain circumstances reduces wear. 

Iron corrosion is called rusting.
