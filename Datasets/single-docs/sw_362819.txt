Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas

Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is a 1997 direct-to-video animated movie. It was produced by The Walt Disney Company. It takes place in the original "Beauty and the Beast". It happens after the fight with the wolves and before the Beast gives Belle the castle library. In this movie, the Beast does not allow Christmas. This is because his change from the Prince was on that time of year. Belle, Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, and Chip convince him that Christmas is a good holiday. The movie also shows the time the enchantress put the spell on the castle in more detail.


The movie won two of its eight nominations.

The original score and songs were composed by Rachel Portman. The lyrics were by Don Black. The movie's songs were recorded "live" with an orchestra and the cast in a room. This is similar to the first movie.
