Long-tailed river stingray

The long-tailed river stingray or antenna ray, "Plesiotrygon iwamae", is a species of freshwater stingray in the family Potamotrygonidae.

These animals have a long tail, small eyes, and few pectoral-fin radials.

They eat worms, crustaceans, mollusks, and small bottom fish (such as small catfish). They can detect electrical and chemical signals from prey in mud and sand.

The species was mentioned in 1987 by Hugo P. Castello from Museu de Zoologia, University of SÃ£o Paulo. Examples were then found in other museums that had been given wrong names or identified incorrectly.

This fish does not appear often in the aquarium trade.
