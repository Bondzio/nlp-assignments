Antiderivative

Antidifferentiation (also called indefinite integration) is a part of mathematics. It is the opposite of differentiation. Antidifferentiation is integration with no limits (which is why it is called indefinite). The answer to an antiderivative is an equation.

It is written as formula_1


To integrate formula_6


This can be shown as:

formula_13

When there are many formula_3 terms, integrate each part on its own:

formula_15

Changing fractions and roots into powers makes it easier:

If you want to integrate a bracket like formula_21, we need to do it a different way. It is called the chain rule. It is like simple integration. It only works if the formula_3 in the bracket has a power of 1 (it is linear) like formula_3 or formula_24 (not formula_25 or formula_26).
