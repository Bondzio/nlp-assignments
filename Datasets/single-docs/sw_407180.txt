Scandinavian Mountains

The Scandinavian Mountains are a mountain range that runs through the Scandinavian Peninsula. The western sides of the mountains drop steeply into the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, where they form the fjords of Norway. To the north they form the border between Norway and Sweden, and passing across the Arctic Circle. A small part of the range runs into Finland, but this part mostly consists of hills.

Galdh√∏piggen in southern Norway is the highest peak in the range, at . Kebnekaise has the highest peak on the Swedish side, at . Halti is the highest peak in Finland, at . The range's proximity to the Arctic and the North Atlantic ocean has caused the formation of many icefields and glaciers.
