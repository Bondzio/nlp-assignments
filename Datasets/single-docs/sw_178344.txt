Jewish Defense League

The Jewish Defense League (JDL) is a Jewish organization started in the US in 1968. Its stated goal is to "protect Jews from antisemitism by whatever means necessary". The JDL was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. The FBI called the JDL a ""right-wing terrorist group"".
