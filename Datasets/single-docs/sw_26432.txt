Amazon.com

Amazon.com is an online store that sells books, movies, games, DVDs, music CDs, computer software and other items (like Amazon Kindle). It is the largest online retailer right now. It was started by Jeff Bezos in 1994 and the headquarters is in Seattle. The original name was Cadabra.com but was changed to Amazon later on because it sounded like the word "cadaver". The store is named after the world's second longest river.
