Home on the Range

"Home on the Range" is an American folk song. The lyrics to "Home on the Range" describe life in the Western United States during the 1800s. The song was originally a poem written in fall of 1872 by Brewster Higley titled "My Western Home". Higley was possibly inspired to write the poem from the view outside his log cabin window. The song appeared in the December 1873 issue of "The Smith County Pioneer" under the name "Oh, Give Me a Home Where the Buffalo Roam". The music for "Home on the Range" was composed by Higley's friend, Daniel E. Kelley.

"Home on the Range" became popular in the 1930s. In fact, former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt said "Home on the Range" was his favorite song. In 1947, Kansas adopted "Home on the Range" as their state song.
