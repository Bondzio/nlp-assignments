Albufera Sauce

Albufera sauce (fr. Sauce Albuféra) is a minor sauce whose mother sauce isn velouté. Probably created by Antonin Careme rather than his trainee Adolphe Dugléré (who was only ten when Albufera fell out of favour), to accompany Poularde Albufera, which he also created. It was named in honour of the Duke of Albufera. 

Escoffier gives a recipe in "Le Guide culinaire" which consists of a base of Suprême Sauce to which is added meat glaze in order to lend the latter an ivory-white tint which characterizes it. It is served chiefly with poultry and sweetbreads.
