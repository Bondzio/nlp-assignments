National Day Parade, 2009

The National Day Parade 2009 (NDP 2009) was a national ceremony. Like all National Day Parades, it was held on 9 August. The event was at The Float at Marina Bay. 2009 was Singapore's 44th year of independence. For the third time, the event was held in the Marina Bay area.

The NDP 2009 logo depicts a stylised hand reaching out to Singaporeans of different backgrounds, connecting all as one united people. A design of the heart on the palm of the hand means people's compassion and care for their citizens. 

The five stars forming the fingers symbolise democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality in vibrant colours reflecting the nation's diversity. Reaching up in celebration of progress as a nation, the shooting stars represent people's hope for a better future.

The theme for NDP 09, "Come Together â€“ Reaching Out, Reaching Up" is inspired by the Singapore National Pledge. It is about Singaporeans "coming together" as "one united people", to "reach out" to all Singaporeans regardless of "race, language or religion", and to "reach up" towards our hopes and aspirations articulated when we pledge to "achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation".
