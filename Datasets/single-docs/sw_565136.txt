Men Going Their Own Way

Men Going Their Own Way (also MGTOW or migtow) is an online community supported by websites and social media.

It is a movement and community that wants to avoid romance and relationships. One reason men do this is because they think it is hard to maintain a relationship, especially with women, in the modern day.
