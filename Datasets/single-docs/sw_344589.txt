Mount Alvernia

Mount Alvernia (formerly Como Hill) is on Cat Island in the Bahamas. It is the highest point in the country at above sea level. The mountain shares its name with a school in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

The name is for La Verna, the hill in Tuscany where St. Francis of Assisi received the Wounds of the Cross.
