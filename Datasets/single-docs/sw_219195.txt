Sediment

Sediment is the matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes. Compressed and gradually transformed, sediment is the basis of sedimentary rocks. The term is also used for material transported by wind or water, and deposited on the surface. In due course, this may also turn into rock. The study of how sedimentary rocks are formed is called sedimentology.

In more general use, sediment is any matter which falls to the bottom of a liquid, such as beer.
