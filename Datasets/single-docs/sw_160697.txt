British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification

A number of different numbering and classification schemes were used for locomotives and multiple units operated by British Railways (BR), and this page explains the principal systems. This section also covers the post-privatisation period, as the broad numbering and classification arrangements have not altered since the break-up of BR.

For further information on individual classes of locomotive or multiple unit, see these pages:
