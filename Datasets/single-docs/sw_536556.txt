Abu Ala al-Afri

Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli (1957/1959 â€“ 25 March 2016) (), alternatively known as Abu Ala al-Afri () was the Deputy leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He was said to become leader of the group after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was severely injured by an airstrike.

On 14 May 2014, Abu Ala al-Afri was listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S Treasury Department. On 5 May 2015, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to US$7 million for information leading to al-Afri's capture or death.

The U.S. Pentagon announced his death from an airstrike on 25 March 2016 in Syria, correcting previous Iraqi claims.
