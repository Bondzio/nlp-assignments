Tol'able David

Tol'able David (1921) is a silent movie starring Richard Barthelmess. It is based on a story by Joseph Hergesheimer. The movie was produced and directed by Henry King for Inspiration Pictures. 

The movie was voted a Photoplay Magazine 1921 "medal of honor". In 2007, "Tol'able David" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 

Young David Kinemon, son of West Virginia tenant farmers, wants to be treated like a man by his family and neighbors. He is constantly reminded that he is still a boy and he is only "tol'able" but not a man. He proves himself a man when outlaws move onto a nearby farm.
