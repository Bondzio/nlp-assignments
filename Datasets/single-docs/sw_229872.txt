Wigger

The term wigger means a person who by act does things that stereotypically are related to urban African Americans, Black British and Caribbean culture, especially in relation to hip hop culture and British Grime/Garage scene. The word can also be spelled as wigga, whigger or whigga, also known as acting black. 

The term originates from a blend of the word "white" and the insulting term "nigger". The word is considered offensive by some because of its sameness to "nigger". Also known to be offensive due to stereotypical ideas about urban blacks.
The act of white people using stereotypical black actions, slang, and clothing has appeared in many generations since slavery was removed in the western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the "white negro" in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as seen in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay, "The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster"." It was later seen in the Zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s; the hipster of the 1940s; and the beatnik and rock and roller of the 1950s.
