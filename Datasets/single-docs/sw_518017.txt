Uncle B

Uncle B is the debut studio album released by N-Dubz. The album is dedicated to N-Dubz's first manager and father of Dappy, Byron Contostavlos. He died shortly before the band were signed to their second record label All Around the World. The album was released 17 November 2008. This is even though the group started recording it in 2006. The delay was because to the group changing record label from LRC to All Around the World.
