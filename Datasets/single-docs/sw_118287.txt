Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring

Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring is a 2002 movie that stars Tom and Jerry. It is the first Tom and Jerry movie to only be released only on video and never in a movie theatre. Also, it was the final cartoon and the last Tom and Jerry cartoon to be co-executive produced by both, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, as Hanna died in March 22, 2001, a few days before the movie's release.
