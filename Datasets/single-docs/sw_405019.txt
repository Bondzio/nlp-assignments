Division of Darling Downs

The Division of Darling Downs was an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was one of the original 75 divisions for the first Australian election in 1901. It was named for the Darling Downs region of Queensland. It included the city of Toowoomba and surrounding rural areas. 

Its famous members included Sir Littleton Groom, Cabinet minister and Speaker, and Arthur Fadden, Prime Minister of Australia in 1941.

The electorate's first member, William Henry Groom, died at the first Commonwealth Parliament meeting in Melbourne in 1901. His death led to Australia's first by-election, which was won by his son Littleton. The seat was abolished in 1984, largely being replaced by the Division of Groom.
