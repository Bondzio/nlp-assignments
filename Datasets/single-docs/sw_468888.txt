British Columbia Highway 1

British Columbia Highway 1 is part of the British Columbia section of the Trans-Canada Highway. It is 1,039 kilometers (646 miles) long across the southern part of British Columbia, including the part covered by ferries.

The highway starts near the provincial border with Alberta near Kicking Horse Pass, passign through the town of Field. Between the towns of Monte Creek and Cache Creek, the highway shares the same roadway with Highway 5 and Highway 97 for much of the distance. At West Vancouver on the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Highway 1 ends on the mainland at the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal. The highway then resumes on Vancouver Island at the B.C. Ferry terminal near Departure Bay. The highway runs southward near the eastern coast of the island until it ends in the city of Victoria.
