Giosuè Carducci

Giosuè Alessandro Giuseppe Carducci (Pietrasanta, 27 July 1835 – Bologna, 16 February 1907) was an Italian poet and teacher. He was very influential and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy. In 1906, he became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

He was fascinated with the restrained style of Greek and Roman antiquity, and his mature work reflects a restrained classical style, often using the classical meters of Latin poets as Horace and Virgil.
