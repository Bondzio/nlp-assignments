Y tu mamá también

Y tu mamá también ("And your mother too") is a 2001 award-winning Mexican dramatic road movie. It was directed by Alfonso Cuarón and written by him and his brother Carlos Cuarón. 

It was released without a rating in the United States because the movie's distributors believed a market-limiting NC-17 was unavoidable. This movie was released during 2002 in the US.
