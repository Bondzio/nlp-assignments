LeBron Raymone James (born December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is widely regarded as one the greatest basketball players in NBA history. 

The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio.
James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals.
