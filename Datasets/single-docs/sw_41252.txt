Trading post

A trading post is a place where trade takes place. The path to a trading post, or between trading posts, is known as a trade route. 

Trading posts were common places in Canada and the United States when they were both new countries. People used trading posts to trade fur and other things. 

Trading posts are also used in many campsites across the United States and Canada as places to buy snacks and other things.
