Sector model

Sector model is a basic model in modern urban planning that was developed by Homer Hoyt. He published his work in 1939 after studying 140 American cities. His model was a response to the concentric zone model developed by R. E. Park, E. W. Burgess and R. D. McKenzie. Hoyt found that cities grow outward in wedge-shaped sectors instead of concentric circles.
