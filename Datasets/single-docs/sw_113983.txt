Durian

A durian is a big fruit with a strong smell and a hard shell with sharp thorns. Its flavour is loved by some people, especially in Southeast Asia, where people name it "King of Fruits". Many hotels and public transportation systems do not let people carry durians because of the strong smell, which many people find unpleasant.

Durian's flavour has been compared to custard and almonds. There are many different kinds of durian. Many people like some kinds more than they like others. This means that some kinds cost more than others.

The fruit can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and usually weighs one to three kg (2 to 7 lb).

Durian is a tropical fruit. It grows only in humid, hot places. The flesh is used for many dishes in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.
