Edward Snowden

Edward Joseph Snowden (born 21 June 1983) is a former contractor who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. He released top secret NSA documents. His job at the NSA allowed him access to them. He has said, "I do not want to live in a world where anything I do or say is recorded."

Snowden traveled to Moscow after giving the documents to American journalists in Hong Kong. He had asylum in Russia for one year. Then he was granted permission to stay in the country for three more years. This has increased tensions between Russia and the United States.

In 2013 Snowden was voted Person of the Year by "The Guardian".
