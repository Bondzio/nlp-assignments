Jeanne Calment

Jeanne Louise Calment (21 February 1875 â€“ 4 August 1997) was a French supercentenarian. She was born in Arles. At age 122 years 164 days, was the verified oldest person ever. She was active during her life, lived on her own until she was almost 110, and talked a lot until months before her death. She became the undisputed oldest person ever in 1990. Calment still rode her bike at the age of 100 in 1975. Once, she fell off and developed a brief period of amnesia. She recovered sometime later. In 1888, when she was 13, Calment met Vincent van Gogh while he visited her uncle's shop to buy canvas. During her later years in the 1990s, she could not hear very well. In 1995 at the age of 120 years, she became the subject of her own documentary, 120 Years with Jeanne Calment. She died in Arles.
