André Franquin

André Franquin (3 January 1924 – 5 January 1997) was a Belgian comics artist. His best known comic strip creations are "Gaston" and "Marsupilami". He made these when he worked on the "Spirou et Fantasio" comic strip from 1947 to 1969. This time is seen by many as the series' golden age.
