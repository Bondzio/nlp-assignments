Orlando Letelier

Orlando Letelier del Solar (April 13, 1932 â€“ September 21, 1976) was a Chilean socialist politician during the presidency of Salvador Allende. 

Looking for a refuge from the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet, Letelier accepted academic positions in Washington, D.C. He was assassinated by agents of the Pinochet regime's secret police (DINA) in 1976, in collaboration with members of the "Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations".
