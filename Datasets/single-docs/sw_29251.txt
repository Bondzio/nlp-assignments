Guided by Voices

Guided by Voices (often called GBV) was an American indie band. Guided by Voices was very famous for making many albums. They were active between 1986 and 2004. The band reunited in 2010 but broke up again in 2014.

The band had many members who only stayed for a while. Robert Pollard was the most important member. Before becoming a full time musical artist, he was a teacher at an elementary school. While he was teaching, he created lots of music for the band. Robert is a solo artist today. He is a great fan of rock music. His music, and the music of Guided by Voices, is inspired by the famous British band The Beatles and different music styles like post-British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic, prog-rock, as well as punk and post-punk.


In 2004, during the band's last concert tour, many cities around the United States picked a day to be "Guided by Voices Day" in that city. Some of them are:
