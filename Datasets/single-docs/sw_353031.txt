Orchid (color)

Orchid is a bright rich purple color that resembles the color of some orchids. 

Various tones of "orchid" may range from grayish purple to purplish-pink to strong reddish purple.

The first written use of "orchid" as a color name in English was in 1915.

In 1987, orchid was included as one of the X11 colors. After the invention of the world wide web in 1991, these became known as the X11 web colors.

The name comes from from the flowers of some species of the vast orchid family (Orchidaceae), such as "Laelia furfuracea" and "Ascocentrum pusillum", which have petals of this color.

The word "Orchid" derives from the Greek word "orchis" which means testicle, after the appearance of the roots of plants of the genus "Orchis".
