Empress Jitō

Jitō's reign started in 686 and ended in 697. Historians consider details about the life of Empress Jitō to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Jitō"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

In the history of Japan, Jitō was the third of eight women to be empress. The two female monarchs before Jitō were (a) Suiko and (b) Kōgyoku/Saimei. The five women monarchs after Jitō were (c) Gemmei, (d) Genshō, (e) Kōken/Shōtoku, (f) Meishō, and (g) Go-Sakuramachi.

Before she became the monarch, this princess's personal name ("imina") was , or alternately Uno.

Princess Uno was the daughter of Emperor Tenji and she was the wife of Emperor Temmu, who was Tenji's brother.

In this period, the court and the government was centered at Fujiwara Palace in Yamato.







The actual site of Jitō's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jitō's mausoleum. It is formally named "Ochi-no-Okanoe no misasagi".

The "Man'yōshū" includes a waka poem said to have been composed by Jitō
