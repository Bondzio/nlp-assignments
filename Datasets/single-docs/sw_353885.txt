Fiordland penguin

The Fiordland penguin, "Eudyptes pachyrhynchus", is a crested penguin (like the Snares penguin). They have white stripes on their belly cheeks and they have a black back. They have bright yellow eyebrows and when they get older they turn darker. They also have an orange beak; big feet and they have small black tails. They weigh 8 pounds and are 17-24 inches tall.

They eat fish, squid and krill (small shrimps) and they like to drink extra cold water. The Fiordland penguinâ€™s main predator (animal which hunts animals) is seals.
Most Fiordland penguins live in the woodland on the coast of south New Zealand but some also live in Tasmania. They live up to 15 to 20 years in the wild. They swim very fast in the water near New Zealand.
