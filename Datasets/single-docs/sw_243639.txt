Billabong (lake)

Billabong is an Australian English word meaning a small lake, specifically an oxbow lake. Billabongs are usually formed when the path of a creek or river changes, leaving a dead end. Some people say there is a Scottish Gaelic origin, but the word is most likely from the Wiradjuri term bilaba≈ã.

Billabongs appear often in Australian literature. One of the most famous is in the opening line of the famous folk song "Waltzing Matilda".
