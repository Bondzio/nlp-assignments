Dollhouse was an hour-long American television series. The series is written by producer Joss Whedon and stars Eliza Dushku. Whedon and Dushku both worked together on the television series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and its darker spin-off " Angel". Tim Minear, who also worked with "Buffy" and "Angel" is also involved. The series is made by 20th Century Fox Television. Twelve episodes of "Dollhouse" aired on FOX. Two more episodes that were not shown on television will be on the DVD collection of episodes.

In "Dollhouse", Eliza Dushku plays a young woman named Echo. She is one of a group of men and women who can have "personality packages" put into their minds. These packages can include many things, for example, memory, skills, language and muscle memory. These people live in a futuristic dormitory/laboratory named the "Dollhouse". They are given special personas as part of the personality packages. These are used to do many different types of assignments. For example, the jobs could be romantic, adventurous, strange, or illegal. After the assignment, the information is removed from their minds and they are left in a child-like state with no memories. The series follows Echo as she begins to remember things even though her mind is constantly being erased and new memories implanted into it.
