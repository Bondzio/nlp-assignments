Campervan

Campervans are self-propelled vehicles that can provide transport and sleeping accommodation. The term "campervan" mainly represents vans which are fitted out, with a custom built body for use as accommodation. In the United States, the vans are also known as "recreational vehicles" or RVs and are larger than in Europe. Such vehicles sometimes have a refrigerator, microwave oven, showers and televisions.
