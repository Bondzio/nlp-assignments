LGBT rights in New Zealand

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in New Zealand have improved a lot in recent years. In 2005 civil partnerships were legalised and 2013 same sex marriages were legalised. 

In the past, homosexuality was illegal in New Zealand. It was decriminalised (made legal) in 1986.
