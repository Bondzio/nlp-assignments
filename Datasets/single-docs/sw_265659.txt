Rhinoceros hornbill

The Rhinoceros hornbill ("Buceros rhinoceros") is one of the largest hornbills: adults are about the size of a swan. It lives in parts of Malaya and Thailand. 

It usually wanders here and there in the forest, where it lives, in search of fruits and nuts to eat. Hornbills use their big bills to open the tough husks of nuts and to handle large fruit.
