Blohm &amp; Voss Bv 142

The Blohm & Voss Bv 142 was a German reconnaissance aircraft of World War II. Its maiden flight was in October 1938. It was built at the beginning like an airliner. But just one was used by Lufthansa. The others were used by Luftwaffe for far reconnaissance. Fragile and unwieldy it was stopped in 1942, just two years after it commissioned. Only four examples were built.
