Sune (book series)

The Sune series is a series of children's/youth books by Swedish writers Anders Jacobsson and Sören Olsson. The books have been published since 1984. The stories are originally a radio series, produced as totally 90 episodes for Swedish radio between the years of 1983 and 1993. The Sune books are set in fictional town of "Glimmerdagg" in Sweden, which just like Berts hometown Öreskoga is located somewhere between Karlskoga-Örebro. There is Söderskolan, for the grades 1–6. The Sune books are told in the third person perspective and using the present tense and uses imperfect during flashback scenes, while Bert is told as a first person narrative.

Instead of being a typical "tough guy" who uses to fight or play soccer, Sune is more interested into girls.
