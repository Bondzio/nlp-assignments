Hattrick (computer game)

If one registers himself as user he will receive a team. The user will then play in a competition with other managers. The user has to care for the whole team. This can be done by buying and selling players, training players, creating tactics and by creating line ups.

Hattrick has a 'strong' community. Because of that, not only the forums in-game are active but also those on external sites.

Hattrick is property of Hattrick Ltd. The CEO is Johan Gustafson.
