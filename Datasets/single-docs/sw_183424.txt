King's Cross station

King's Cross station is an important railway station in London. It is also the home of the King's Cross St. Pancras tube station, which it shares with the nearby St Pancras station.

King's Cross railway station first opened in 1852.
Plans to make the station were made as early as 1848 by George Turnbull. A detailed design was made by Lewis Cubitt.

The station is located on the north-eastern edge of Central London, where the A501 Euston Road and York Way cross. It is in the Kings Cross district, within the London Borough of Camden, and on the border of the London Borough of Islington.

King's Cross forms the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, one of the UK's major railway stations. It was the major terminus of the LNER: the London and North-Eastern Railway Ltd. Immediately to its west is St Pancras station, the terminus for international Eurostar trains.
