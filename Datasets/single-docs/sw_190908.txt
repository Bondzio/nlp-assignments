Ares V

The Ares V was a plan to create a cargo rocket for the Constellation program. Ares V was planned to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for a plan to return to the Moon in 2019. The Ares V was supposed to complement the Ares I, which was being designed as a crew launch vehicle. The Ares designs were selected for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness. 

The Ares V was planned to be able to carry about 188 tonnes (414,000 lb) to Low Earth orbit (LEO), and 71 tonnes (157,000 lb) to the Moon. Upon completion the Ares V was planned to be the most powerful rocket ever built, lifting more into orbit than even the Saturn V. Ares V, Ares IV, and Ares I are named after Ares, the Greek god, which is the equivalent to the Roman god Mars.
