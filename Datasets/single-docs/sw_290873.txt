Caillou

Caillou is an American/Canadian children's TV show based on the series of books by author Christine L'Heureux and illustrator Hélène Desputeaux. It is about a young 4-year-old who lives with his dad named Boris, his mom named Doris, and his 2-year-old sister named Rosie. Caillou lives in a blue house on 17 Pine Street. Caillou was first voiced by Bryn McAuley, then Jaclyn Linetsky, but due to her death in 2003, Jaclyn was replaced with Annie Bovaird. 

The show is about a young boy named Caillou who lives with his mom, Doris; his dad, Boris; his little sister, Rosie; and his pet cat, Gilbert. Mr. Hinkle lives next door to Caillou's house and Caillou has a babysitter named Julie. In the first season, Caillou was 2–3 years old and wore a gray shirt, but later, he wore a yellow shirt. In season 4, Caillou started going to preschool.

The series originally aired on PBS Kids in the United States and Teletoon in Canada.
