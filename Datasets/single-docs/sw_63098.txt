Lepidoptera

The order Lepidoptera is the second biggest order in the class Insecta. It includes the butterflies, moths and skippers. There is no common word for the group: ordinary people talk of "butterflies and moths". A person who collects or studies this order is called a Lepidopterist. 

The order has more than 180,000 species in 128 families and 47 superfamilies. They are 10% of all the described species of living organisms. The order Coleoptera (the beetles) is the only order that has more species. 

The name, Lepidoptera, comes from the Ancient Greek words (scale) and (wing).

Lepidopterans go through "complete metamorphosis". This means that they have a four parts of their life. The first part is the egg. The second part is the caterpillar or larva. The third part is the pupa. The last part is the adult or imago.

The larvae have a tough head and a soft body. They have mouths that are made to chew. Some larvae are covered with hairs, or other body extensions. The larvae have three pairs of small legs on the thorax. These legs are called true legs. There are up to five pairs of bigger legs on the abdomen. These legs are called prolegs. Lepidopteran larvae can be confused with the larvae of sawflies. The difference between Lepidopteran larvae and sawfly larvae is that Lepidopteran larvae have tiny hooks on their prolegs. These hooks are called crochets. Most larvae are herbivores, but a few are carnivores and detritivores.

Adults have two pairs of wings. They are covered by small scales. In some species, the adults have very small wings or no wings at all. This is more common in females. Adults have antennae. Some moths have antennae that look like feathers. These feather-like antennae are larger in males than females. Adults have a mouthpart called a proboscis. It is made for sucking nectar from flowers. Some adults do not have mouths and cannot feed. Others have different mouths that are made to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices.
