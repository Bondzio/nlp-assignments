Oil beetle

The oil beetle (or Meloe) is a blister beetle genus. They are called "oil beetles" because they release oily droplets of hemolymph when disturbed.

The liquid is a poisonous chemical that causes skin blistering and painful swelling.

Members of this genus do not have wings. They have shortened elytra.
