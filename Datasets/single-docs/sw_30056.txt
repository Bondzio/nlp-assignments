Sawm

Sawm () is one of the most important aspects of Islam. It involves fasting. Fasting is done as prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence ("Fiqh"). In Islamic law, "sawm" means to stop eating and drinking (including water) during daylight hours. This kind of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
