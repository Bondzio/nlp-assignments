Marina Nikolayevna Oswald Porter (July 17, 1941) is the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald. According to the Warren Commission he was the sole assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. 

She was born in Severodvinsk (formerly named Molotovsk), Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia on 17 July 1941. She met Lee Harvey Oswald at a dance in March 1961 in Russia. They were married on April 30 1961. Their daughter, June Lee, was born on February 15, 1962. Later that year the Oswalds moved from Russia to the United States. In Dallas, Marina gave birth to a second daughter, Audrey Marina Rachel Oswald. After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Oswald was arrested. Two days later Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby while still in police custody. Porter was under Secret Service protection until she finished giving testimony before the Warren Commission. She told the commission she believed husband was guilty of shooting President Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. In 1965, she married Kenneth Jess Porter. They had two sons. In 1989, Porter became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
