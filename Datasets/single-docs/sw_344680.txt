Ajkaceratops

Ajkaceratops (pronounced "oi-ka-se-ra-tops") is a genus of ceratopsian dinosaur described in 2010. It lived in the Cretaceous period in what is now Europe, in what was back then the Tethyan archipelago. It is a ceratopsian, and is beaked. "Ceratops" means "horned face" in Greek.

The generic name, "Ajkaceratops", honors Ajka, a town in Hungary where the fossils where found.

The Ajkaceratops has a skull that looks a lot like a Protoceratops skull, except that it has a hump near the beak. The body is slender and long, compared to the skull. The tail is very short for its size.
