Desmosome

A desmosome is a cell structure for cell-to-cell adhesion. They are localized spot-like adhesions on the outer sides of plasma membranes.

Desmosomes help to keep cells together in a sheet. They are found in epithelial tissue, like multilayer squamous epithelium. The intercellular space is relatively wide up to about 30Â nm.
