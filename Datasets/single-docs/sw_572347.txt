Stećak

Stećak (Стећак, ; plural: Stećci, Стећци, ) are monumental tombstones made in medieval Bosnia. 

The tombstones are mostly in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a smaller amount in the border area of Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. About 60,000 are found within the territory of the modern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The rest of 10,000 are found in what are today Croatia (4,400), Montenegro (3,500), and Serbia (4,100). The stećak are at more than 3,300 odd sites with over 90% in poor condition.
