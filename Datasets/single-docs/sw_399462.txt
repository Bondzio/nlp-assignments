Tarzan of the Apes (1918 movie)

Tarzan of the Apes is a 1918 silent movie. It was directed by Scott Sidney. It stars Elmo Lincoln and Enid Markey. The movie was the first Tarzan movie ever made. It is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's book "Tarzan of the Apes". The movie adapts only the first part of the book. The rest of the book became the sequel, "The Romance of Tarzan". The movie is considered the most faithful to the book of all the movie adaptations. 

Lord and Lady Greystoke are passengers on a ship bound for Africa. When the ship is taken over by mutineers, the two are left on a tropical coast. They die. Their infant son is adopted by Kala, an ape. She raises him as her own. 

The young Tarzan (Gordon Griffith) grows up among the apes. He becomes their king. A sailor discovers Tarzan. He reports to Tarzan's relatives in England. An expedition led by Professor Porter sets off to find Tarzan. 

The now-adult Tarzan (Elmo Lincoln) rescues Porter's daughter Jane (Enid Markey) when native villagers kidnap her. Tarzan romances her, and she comes to accept his love.
