Adabel Guerrero

Adabel Guerrero is a Argentine professional theatre dancer, actress and "vedette". She is of Ukrainian and Spaniard descent.

Guerrero was in "Dancing with the Stars" in Argentina competing together with professional dancer Martin Whitecamp. They were eliminated by "41.28%" of the public vote.







When asked about her inspiration on dancing Guerrero responded: 

""Julio Bocca, Maximiliano Guerra, Hernán Piquín ... They are the highest in Argentina, each with their own style. Maxi, more manly, more land, and Julio and Piquín more princely, more aerial. There is no first or second, they are different from each other.They have broken their souls to get where they are now.""

Guerrero also says that dance it self is her inspiration:
""To me, dancing transports me, its an absolute passion. Dancing is the best,its orgasmic.""
