Skinner (movie)

Skinner is a 1993 independent movie, splatter and slasher motion picture starring Ted Raimi, Traci Lords, Ricki Lake and Richard Schiff.

Dennis Skinner is a likeable decent-looking lad, who is driven by a disturbing childhood; moonlights as a skid row slasher style, serial killer who tends to prey on hookers, in-between those co-workers of his who despise him as he does in return. Who "punishes" those (he finds offensive) in particular, by flaying his victims alive. On his trail is Heidi, a junkie prostitute, who survived one of his brutal attacks and now strives for revenge.
