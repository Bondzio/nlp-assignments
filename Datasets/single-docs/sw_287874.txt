White mustard

White mustard is an annual plant.

The yellow flowers of the plant make seed pods, with each pod having a half dozen seeds. These seeds are harvested just before the pods become ripe.

White mustard seeds are hard and round, usually around 1 to 1.5 millimetres, with a color forming from beige or yellow to light brown.

In Greece, the plant's leaves can be eaten during the winter, before it blooms. Greeks call it "vrouves" or "lapsana".

The blooming season of this plant (Februaryâ€“March) is celebrated in the Mustard Festival.
