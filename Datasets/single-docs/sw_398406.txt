Panchayat town

A Panchayat Town or Town Panchayat is a type of town in India. It refers to any small town which is formed under the Panchayati raj administrative system. It will have under 25,000 people living there. In census data, the abbreviation T.P. is used to indicate a "Town Panchayat". Tamil Nadu was the first state to introduce the panchayat town as an intermediate step between rural villages and Urban Local Bodies (ULB).

Each state of India has an organisation that manages panchayat towns.
