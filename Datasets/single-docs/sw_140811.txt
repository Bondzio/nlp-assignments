The Outsiders is a novel by S. E. Hinton, first published in 1967 by Viking Press. Hinton was 15 when she began writing the novel and 16 when it was published. "The Outsiders" is the lifestory of fourteen-year-old Ponyboy Michael Curtis. Hinton explores a multitude of themes throughout the story, such as friendship, and coming of age. They are seen by following two rival groups, the Greasers and the Socs (pronounced "soashes" by the author, short for "Socials"), who are separated by status.

The story starts when Ponyboy leaves a movie showing area and the Socs jump on him. His brother Darry saves him. He talks about Socs and greasers and how they are apart. The Socs were the Westside rich kids, and the greasers were of the lowest class. Later, The socs try to kill Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny, kills a Soc and they go hide in a church. While they are gone the church burns on fire and they save the kids. However, Johnny breaks his back and dies a week later. Then Dally is so sad about Johnny dying that he robs a store, where he is killed by police.
