Land

Most of the Earth's surface is covered with water. The roughly 22 percent that is not, is called land (as opposed to water). Land can have different types of soil. It may be covered with stones, sand, dirt, etc. Sometimes it is not clear where land ends and a body of water begins.

A land can also mean some territory, forming part of a country.
