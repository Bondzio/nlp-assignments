The Marecchia () is a river of the Emilia-Romagna region. The city of Rimini gets its name from the Latin name of the river.

Its low course marks the end of the Padan Plain ().

The Marecchia river has a length of , and a drainage basin with an area of approximately .

Its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) depends of the season: in the autumn could be as high as but is very low during summer. Most of the time, the discharge is about .

The Marecchia river flows through a valley named after it, "Valmarecchia". The river starts at about west of "Viamaggio" ("comune" of Pieve Santo Stefano) and about southwest of the "comune" of Badia Tedalda, in the province of Arezzo (Tuscany), in the "Alpe della Luna" at an elevation of above sea level.

At about to the northeast of Badia Tedalda, the river gets into the Emilia-Romagna region, in the Casteldelci "comune", province of Rimini. Then it flows through Ca 'Raffaello, an exclave of Badia Tedalda; to the north of here, the Senatello river flows into the Marecchia as a left tributary. Later, in "Ponte Masa", the Masa river flows from the right into the Marecchia.

Shortly after "Torello", the San Marino river flows as a right tributary and, after the Verucchio "comune", the Ausa flows also from the right.

Between the "frazioni" (Italian subdivisions of a municipality) of "Rivabella" and "San Giuliano", in Rimini, the Marecchia river ends in the Adriatic Sea.

The Bridge of Tiberius () or Bridge of Augustus () is a Roman bridge in Rimini. Its construction began in times of Augustus but was finished in 20 AD in times of Tiberius.
