Edwin Pope

John Edwin Pope (April 11, 1928 â€“ January 19, 2017) was an American journalist. 

He was known for his sportswriting at the "Miami Herald", where his work appeared from 1956 until his death in 2017. He covered Super Bowl I through Super Bowl XLVII. Some called him as "the best writer of sports in America."

Pope's success with his 1954 book "Football's Greatest Coaches", allowed him to leave the Atlanta area and move down to Miami, where he accepted a job at the Miami Herald in 1956. While he retired as the Herald sports editor in 2003, he contributed columns to the newspaper until 2016, when he wrote his last piece eulogizing boxer and former Miami resident Muhammad Ali.
