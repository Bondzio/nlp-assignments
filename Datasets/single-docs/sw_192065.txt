Cultivar

A cultivar is a plant that has been selected for planting and sale because it has certain characteristics. It keeps its traits when it is propagated because they are inherited. 

Usually, cultivars are given a name which is not related to their biological taxon. There is a system of naming run by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (the ICNCP), commonly known as the Cultivated Plant Code.
