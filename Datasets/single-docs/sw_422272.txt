Shock site

A shock site is a website that wants to be offensive and to shock people that see it. Shock sites usually show pictures that are meant to make people feel disgusted. These pictures are often violent, or pornographic. For example, in 2004 Goatse.cx showed a picture of a man stretching his anus. Often these sites are mentioned in emails, or online discussions, which tries to trick users into following links to another website.
