Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

The Deputy Prime Minister (or DPM) is a high ranking member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

Unlike other countries, the position of Deputy Prime Minister is not always needed. Because of this there is not always a sitting Deputy Prime Minister. This means that it is up to the Prime Minister to choose whether or not he/she wants to have a deputy. The position was created in 1942 and Clement Attlee was the first Deputy Prime Minister. There has been no Deputy Prime Minister since 2015.The last person to hold this post was Nick Clegg.
