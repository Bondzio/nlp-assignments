WPXI (also known as WPXI-TV) is the NBC television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is owned by Cox Enterprises.

On September 1, 1957, WPXI first signed onto television as WIIC-TV.

Bill Cardille was the first to appear on this channel. Some of the first television shows to air on WIIC-TV included "Studio Wrestling" and "Chiller Theatre"

In 1964, the station was sold to current owner Cox Enterprises.

In 1981, the name was changed to WPXI-TV (Pittsburgh 11, with XI being the Roman numeral sign for 11). The WIIC is still used in Pittsburgh, but on a smaller and less known channel showing music videos.
