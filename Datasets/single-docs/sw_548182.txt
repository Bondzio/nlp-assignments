Pokémon Go

Pokémon Go (or Pokémon GO) is a free-to-play Android and iOS game. It was developed by Niantic. It is licensed by The Pokemon Company. It was released in July 2016 in the US, Europe, and Australia. The game lets players take prisoner, train and fight machine-based living beings, called Pocket Monsters or Pokémon. The game makes them seem as though they exist in real life by using GPS and a smartphone's camera. 

As players walk in the real world, their character in the game moves as well. Players can find Pokemon by using the game map to walk to places where the grass is moving. They can then throw a Pokeball at the Pokemon to see if they can catch it. Players can also walk to special places in the game called "PokeStops" or "Gyms". At PokeStops, players can find extra PokeBalls and candy to feed their Pokemon. At Gyms, players can get their pokemon to fight another pokemon to try to win that gym for their team. 

An earlier game by Niantic called "Ingress" was used to make the special places in the game. Pokemon GO got its start in an April Fool's joke by Google and The Pokemon Company in 2013, called "Pokemon Challenge".

An item called the Pokemon GO Plus is being sold to let people play the game without looking at their smartphones all the time. The Pokemon GO Plus looks like a Poké Ball mixed with the Google Maps pin shape.

"Pokémon Go" got a score of 68 on Metacritic.

The game became more popular after they released the Generation II Pokémon, featuring more items and stuff. In that update, more berries (a type of fruit that makes the Pokémon easier to catch, more higher chance on not fleeing etc.) were added, and evolution items were added (things that are used to evolve Pokemon to become one certain), such as the Metal Coat and Kings Rock.
