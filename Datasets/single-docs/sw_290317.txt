Jared Carter

Jared Carter (born January 10, 1939) is an American poet.

Carter studied at Yale University. After military service and travel abroad, he made his home in Indianapolis, where he has lived since 1969.

Carter writes in free verse and in traditional forms. Much of his early work is set in Mississinewa County, an imaginary place that includes the actual Mississinewa River. In recent years, as Carter began to publish his poems on the web, his poetry has ranged farther.

His first collection, "Work, for the Night Is Coming", won the Walt Whitman Award. His second, "After the Rain", received the Poets' Prize. His poems have appeared in literary journals in the U.S. and in the "Twentieth-Century American Poetry," "Contemporary American Poetry," and "Writing Poems."
