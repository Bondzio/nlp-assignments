Little Rock Nine

The Little Rock Nine was a group of African-American students who were in the Little Rock Central High School, Arkansas in 1957. This started the Little Rock Crisis, in which the students were stopped from entering the racially segregated school by Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus. They attended after President Eisenhower sent the United States Army to let them in. This is thought to be one of the most important events in the African-American Civil Rights Movement.
