Local campaigns to conserve native bushland and save old buildings were the forces that led to the first Australian national trusts in New South Wales in 1947, South Australia in 1955 and Victoria in 1956. They were followed later by Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. 

Annie Forsyth Wyatt (1885-1961) was the driving force behind the beginning of the National Trust in Australia. She lived for much of her life in a cottage in Gordon, New South Wales, which is still standing.
