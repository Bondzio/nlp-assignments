List of popes

The List of popes begins with St. Peter and continues through the present day. The pope is the head of the Catholic Church.

Peter was called the Bishop of Rome. All others who became Bishop of Rome were also recognized as popes.

The list sometimes says "interregnum". This is Latin for "between reigns". It means there was no pope.
