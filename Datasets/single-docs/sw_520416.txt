Legal process

Legal process (or sometimes "process"), are the proceedings in any civil lawsuit or criminal prosecution. It also describes the formal notice or writ used by a court to exercise jurisdiction over a person or property. This process is usually "served" upon a party, to require that party to come to court. It may take the form of a summons, mandate, subpoena, warrant, or other written order issued by a court.
