The Color Purple (movie)

The Color Purple is a 1985 American period drama movie that was produced by Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Quincy Jones and Frank Marshall. It was directed by Spielberg. "The Color Purple" is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker.

The movie tells the story of an African American girl named Celie in Georgia from 1909 to 1937. It shows the problems African American women faced during the early 20th century, including poverty, racism, and sexism. Celie is changed as she finds her self-worth through the help of two strong female friends.

The movie is one of only two of Spielberg's movies for which John Williams did not create the music.


"The Color Purple" was nominated for 11 Academy Awards. Notably, Spielberg was not nominated for his direction. It won none of the Academy Awards. This tied the record set by 1977's "The Turning Point" for the most Oscar nominations without a single win.

"The Color Purple" was nominated for five Golden Globes, including Best Picture (Drama), Best Director for Spielberg, and Best Supporting Actress for Winfrey. Its only win went to Goldberg for Best Actress (Drama).

Menno Meyjes was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Spielberg received the Directors Guild of America Award for Best Motion Picture Director, his first.

The movie was shown at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival as a non-competing title.
