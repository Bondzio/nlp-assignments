Canon (company)

Canon began as the Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory. In 1934, the first Japanese 35mm focal plane-shutter camera prototype was made. It was called the "Kwanon". In the next few years, Canon became very important in creating new camera products and making them better.

Today, Canon creates everything from digital cameras and camcorders to laser printers and film.

The name Canon came from the company's first 35Â mm camera. It was named "Kwanon" after the Buddhist goddess of mercy.

Canon is now an international company. Canon has buildings in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the South Seas.
