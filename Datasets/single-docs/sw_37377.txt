Bissau

The city was built by the Portuguese in 1687. It became the capital of Portuguese Guinea in 1942, and has been the capital since independence was declared, except for a short time in 1973 and 1974 when the capital was at Boe. Bissau is famous for having a carnival every year. 

The main things that come from here are peanuts, wood, coconut meat, palm oil, and rubber.
