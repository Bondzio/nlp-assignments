Alexander Grothendieck

Alexander Grothendieck (Berlin, 28 March 1928 13 November 2014, Saint-Girons, Ariège) was a leading figure in the modern field of algebraic geometry.

In 1970 Grothendieck left the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, where he had been appointed research professor (1958–1970) and where he did his greatest work. He turned to radical pacifism and opposed all forms of warfare and aggression. This is why he declined the Crafoord Prize in 1988.

In 1966 he was awarded the Fields Medal.
