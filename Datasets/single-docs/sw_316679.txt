Heroes of Might &amp; Magic VI

Heroes of Might & Magic VI is a computer game issued by Ubisoft. It was released in October 2011. The game is the sixth episode of the "Might & Magic" series.

Game play is turn-based strategy, with the options of single- or multi-player. It is animated. The story continues from the previous episode and is basically told in the introduction. Styles of multiplayer include hot seat offline or online over the internet. Offline and online saves are not compatible.
The game looks like the 5th version. The focus of the game is battles, and to a lesser extent the adventure map. Resources found in earlier versions of the game (sulfur, diamonds or mercury) are not used in this version.
