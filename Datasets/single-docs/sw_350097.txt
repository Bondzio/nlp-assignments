Australian Music Prize

The Australian Music Prize (The AMP) is a yearly award for an Australian band or solo artist. It is $30,000. The AMP was formed in 2005.

The albums are judged on creative merit, not sales or popularity.

The list of nominees is given in February. The winner is announced at an event in Sydney in March.
