Manticore

Manticores (from Greek "martikhoras", meaning man-eater) were mythological creatures in Greek mythology. They were said to have the body of a lion, a human head, and three rows of teeth similar to sharks. Although it changes from story to story, they were also commonly said to have the tail of a dragon or a scorpion. They were also sometimes said to be able to shoot poisonous spines from their tails. When early Greeks noticed that someone had gone missing, some viewed this as proof that manticores existed.
