Shanti Bahini

The Shanti Bahini (, "Peace Force") was the name of the military wing of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti - the United People's Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh.

It was formed in 1972 to preserve the rights of the tribal people in south-eastern Bangladesh, and fought for many years against the central government. It abandoned militancy following the peace treaty signed by the government and the Shamiti on December 2, 1997. Although some members opposed to the peace deal formed a dissident group.
