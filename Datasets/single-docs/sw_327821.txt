Common year starting on Sunday

This is the calendar for any common year starting on Sunday, January 1 (dominical letter A) or for any year in which “Doomsday” is Tuesday. The current year, 2017, is a common year of this type in the Gregorian calendar. The last such year was 2006 and the next such year will be 2023 in the Gregorian calendar,
or Julian years 2007 and 2018 (See tables at bottom.)

A common year is a year with 365 days, in other words, not a leap year.
