Software suite

A software suite or application suite, is a collection of computer programs —usually application software or programming software— of related functionality, often sharing a more-or-less common user interface and some ability to smoothly exchange data with each other. .

Sometimes software "suites" are at a lower price than buying each of "suite" programs.
