University of Warsaw

The University of Warsaw (Polish "Uniwersytet Warszawski") is the largest university in Poland. The chancellor (rector) of the university is Marcin Pa≈Çys.

The "Royal University of Warsaw" was established in 1816, when the parts of Poland were separated in Warsaw, from the academic (i.e. associated with higher education) centre of Cracow more ancient and influential. The School of Law and the School of Medicine had been established first time in the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1816, Alexander I had permitted the Polish authorities to create a university, with five faculties: Law and Administration, Medicine, Philosophy, Theology, and Arts and Humanities. Soon there were 800 students and 50 professors. 

However, after students and professors took part in the November Uprising of 1830, the university was closed by the Russians.
