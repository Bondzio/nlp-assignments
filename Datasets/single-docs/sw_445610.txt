Corporate title

Publicly and privately held for-profit corporations give corporate titles or business titles to company officials to identify their job. Many colleges and universities also use corporate titles. The top executives in senior management are usually the chief executive officer (CEO), chief operations officer (COO), and chief financial officer (CFO).
