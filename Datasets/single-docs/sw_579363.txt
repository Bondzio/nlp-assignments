2017 Saint Petersburg Metro bombing

On 3 April 2017, an explosion took place on the Saint Petersburg Metro between Sennaya Ploshchad and Tekhnologichesky Institut stations. Nine people were initially reported to have died, and later two more died from their injuries. At least 45 others were injured in the incident. 

The explosive device was contained in a briefcase. A second explosive device was found and defused on a train at another metro station.

Investigators stated on 3 April 2017 that they believed the attack was a suicide bombing and identified a Central Asian as the suspected perpetrator. Some reports identified the suspect as Maxim Arishev, a 22-year-old immigrant from Kazakhstan, while others stated the suspect was a 23-year-old native of Kyrgyzstan with Russian citizenship with links to international militant groups. The next day, the suspected perpetrator was named as Akbarzhan Jalilov, a Russian citizen born in Kyrgyzstan. It was the first terrorist attack in the history of the Saint Petersburg Metro system.
