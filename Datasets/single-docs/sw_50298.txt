Phosphate

A phosphate is a salt of phosphoric acid. Phosphates are important in biochemistry.
Phosphates have the formula PO and a molar mass of 94.973 g/mol. An example of a phosphate is sodium phosphate. Three different types of phosphates are known. They are orthophosphate, PO; metaphosphate, PO; and pyrophosphate, PO.
Phosphates are made of one phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms. 
Many phosphates do not dissolve in water.
