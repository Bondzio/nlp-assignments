Bangladesh Liberation War

The Bangladesh Liberation War ( "Muktijuddho") was a revolutionary independence war in 1971 which established the republic of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.

The war started on 26 March 1971 and finished on 16 December, 1971. A category 3 cyclone also appeared during the war. 

Ghulam Azam and Motiur Rahman Nizami were convicted for war crimes as a result of the liberation war. Azam died before a final hearing while Nizami was executed for his crimes in May 2016.
