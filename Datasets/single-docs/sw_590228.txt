Norman Dorsen

Norman Dorsen (September 4, 1930 – July 1, 2017) was an American lawyer. He was the Frederick I. and Grace A. Stokes Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Arthur Garfield Hays Civil Liberties Program at the New York University School of Law. 

Dorsen specialized in Constitutional Law, Civil Liberties, and Comparative Constitutional Law. He was president of the American Civil Liberties Union from 1976 through 1991. He was also president of the Society of American Law Teachers, 1972–1973, and president of the U.S. Association of Constitutional Law in 2000. 

Dorsen successfully argued the case of "In re Gault", 387 U.S. 1 (1967), before the U.S. Supreme Court which held that juveniles accused of crimes in a delinquency proceeding must be afforded many of the same due process rights as adults. He argued Supreme Court cases "Levy v. Louisiana" (1968), ensuring equal protection for out-of-wedlock children, and "United States v. Vuitch" (1971), the first abortion case to reach the Court.

Dorsen died on July 1, 2017 in Manhattan, New York from complications of a stroke, aged 86.
