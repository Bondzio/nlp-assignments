Cerium(IV) oxide

Cerium(IV) oxide is an oxide of the rare earth metal cerium. Its formula is CeO. It is white or light yellow in color. It is an important commercial product. It is used as an intermediate in the purification of the element from the ores. It reacts with carbon monoxide at high temperature to get cerium(III) oxide.

Cerium(IV) oxide can be made by the oxidation of cerium(III) oxide. Also, it can be made by heating cerium(IV) hydroxide.

It can be used as an oxidizing agent. It can be used in oxidation of natural gas.

It glows at high temperature. This allows it to be used in gas mantles to replace harmful thorium(IV) oxide.
