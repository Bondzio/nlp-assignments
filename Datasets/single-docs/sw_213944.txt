Liga MX

Liga MX, known as the Primera División de México before the 2012–13 season, is the top football league in México.

Like most football leagues in Latin America, Liga MX divides its season into two phases—Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for "opening" and "closing"), with different champions in each phase. The Apertura is held in the Northern Hemisphere fall (autumn), and the Clausura in spring.
