Happy Tree Friends

Happy Tree Friends is a show created by Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Warren Graff, and Aubrey Ankrum. It is a flash cartoon, a cartoon made using Adobe Flash. Since it first came out the show has become a popular internet phenomenon and has many fans (though the show is not as popular as it was a few years ago).

Despite the child-like form of the series and having cute characters, the show is violent and not for small children and is only for adults.

While the violence and deaths are comparable to that of "The Itchy & Scratchy Show" (the short cartoon featured on The Simpsons), the comic book series Squeak the Mouse, the 1978 film Watership Down and the 1994 film "Felidae", the portrayal of death in "Happy Tree Friends" is usually more graphic and anatomically correct, showing bloodshed and dismemberment in more vivid and often exaggerated detail.

The show is nearly free of speech; however, when the characters do speak, their words are severely garbled. Though it is easy to tell what each character's reaction is, their words can hardly be understood at all. According to the website, the idea for "Happy Tree Friends" was created by Rhode Montijo when he drew a yellow rabbit, slightly resembling the character Cuddles, on a piece of paper and wrote "Resistance Is Futile" underneath it.

A "Happy Tree Friends" spin-off called "Ka-Pow!" premiered on September 2, 2008.
