Don Juan DeMarco

Don Juan DeMarco is a 1995 movie starring Johnny Depp. It was released to theaters by Warner Bros.

John Arnold DeMarco (Johnny Depp) believes himself to be Don Juan, the greatest lover in the world. Clad in a cape and eye-mask, he undergoes psychiatric treatment with Marlon Brando's character to cure him of his apparent disillusionment with his identity. But the psychiatric sessions have an unexpected effect on his psychiatrist, whose relationship with his wife, played by Faye Dunaway, is also affected.

Selena made a brief cameo as a Mariachi singer. A hit single for Bryan Adams, "Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?", is the cornerstone of the soundtrack.
