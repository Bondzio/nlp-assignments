The Violent Years

The Violent Years is a 1956 American exploitation movie starring Jean Moorhead as Paula Parkins, the leader of a gang of juvenile delinquent high school girls. Ed Wood, Jr., the director of "Glen or Glenda" and "Plan 9 from Outer Space", wrote the screenplay. It was originally titled "Teenage Girl Gang". Star Jean Moorhead was the Playboy Playmate for October 1955.


Paula Parkins gets her kicks leading a gang of bored young women in criminal activities. The gang dresses in men's clothes, robs gas stations, and terrorizes couples in a local lovers' lane. Paula even rapes a young man. 

Paula and her pals wreck a few classrooms in a public school. The police arrive and a deadly shootout takes place. Two members of Paula's gang are killed. Paula shoots and kills a policeman. 

Paula is captured, convicted, and dies in the hospital giving birth to the child she conceived during the rape. Paula's parents are denied custody of their daughter's baby because they did a poor job of raising Paula.

Patrick McKinnon writes, "There are some movies that shouldn't be watched alone or sober. This is one of them. It makes you want to go back in time and beat Ed Wood Jr. to death with one of his own angora sweaters."
