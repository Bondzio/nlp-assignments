Emperor Sujin

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

The "Gukansh≈ç" records that Sujin ruled from the palace of "Mizogaki-no-miya" at Shiki in what will come to be known Yamato province.

Sujin is almost certainly a legend; but the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" record his name and genealogy. He was the second son of Emperor Kaika. 

Some scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors. These critics consider Sujin to be the earliest to have actually existed.

The limited information about Sujin does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

Sujin was interested in agriculture and irrigation. He established a system of taxation.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Sujin. 

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
