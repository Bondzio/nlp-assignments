ShelterBox

ShelterBox is an international disaster relief charity that provides temporary shelter and life saving supplies to displaced families. ShelterBox sends a package that typically contains a tent designed to withstand extreme weather conditions. It also has a water purification kit, blankets, tools, and other things needed to help a family survive after a disaster. The contents of a ShelterBox are designed for the nature and location of the disaster.
