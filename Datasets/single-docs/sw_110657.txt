Danube Delta

The Danube Delta is the second largest delta in Europe, after the Volga Delta. It is one of the best preserved deltas on the continent. Most of the Danube Delta can be found in Romania, but the northern part of the delta is in Ukraine. In the Ukraine the delta is not preserved as well as it is in Romania.

In 1979, the Danube delta became a Biosphere Reserve. The coastal ecosystem is recognized as part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme.
