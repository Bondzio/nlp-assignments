Kangaroo Island

Kangaroo Island is Australia's third-largest island after Tasmania and Melville Island. 

It is southwest of Adelaide in the state of South Australia.

At its closest point to the mainland, it is offshore from Cape Jervis. 

The island is long and between and wide, its area covering . Its coastline is long and highest altitude is .

More than half of the island has never been cleared of vegetation, and a quarter of it is conserved in National Parks, Conservation Parks, and five Wilderness Protection Areas. The main protected areas are:

Because of its isolation from mainland Australia, foxes and rabbits are absent from and prohibited from entering the island. Registration and microchipping of cats is mandatory. 

The Kangaroo Island Kangaroo, Rosenberg's Sand Goanna, Southern Brown Bandicoot, Tammar Wallaby, Common Brushtail Possum, Short-beaked Echidna and New Zealand Fur Seal are native to the island, as well as six bat and frog species. The sole endemic (found nowhere else) vertebrate species is a small marsupial carnivore called the Kangaroo Island Dunnart. The Koala, Common Ringtail Possum and Platypus have been introduced and still survive there. Kangaroo Island had a native species of Emu, the Kangaroo Island Emu; however, it became extinct between 1802 and official European settlement in 1836, perhaps owing to bushfires or from hunting by sealers or whalers.

The introduced Koalas have flourished so well on the island that their preferred food source, the Manna Gum, is at risk of local extinction. Koalas have recently been forced to turn to other, less palatable, species. Park Management has been searching for a solution.

The island is a major tourist attraction.
