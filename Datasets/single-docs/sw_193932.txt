Sojourner Truth

Sojourner Truth (about 1797 – November 26, 1883) was one of the first abolitionists and speakers for women's rights. She was born as a slave, but escaped from slavery in 1826. She was born Isabella Baumfree, but renamed herself to 'Sojourner Truth' when she was 46 and announced she would travel to work against injustice.

She lectured widely on the cruelties she had experienced as a slave. She is best known for her "Ain't I a Woman?" speech, given at the Woman's Rights Convention of 1851. She also gave out speeches about abolishing slavery. Also, she became active in the Underground Railroad, helping blacks escape to freedom.

Isabella Baumfree (Sojourner Truth) was born into slavery around 1797 in Swarterkill, New York. Sojourner was the daughter of James Baumfree and Elizabeth Baumfree. Her family’s slave owner was Colonel Hardenbergh. Sojourner was born a slave and did not know how to read or write because slaves weren’t taught how to. Out of 13 children, she was the youngest.  In 1815 she dated fellow slave Thomas. Together they had 3 children. Her family was separated in 1806. In 1826 Isabella escaped to freedom with her infant daughter. Sojourner changed her name in 1843 from Isabella Baumfree to Sojourner Truth. 

Sojourner was the first African American to win a trial against a white man. This trial was about getting her son Peter back. This was a great accomplishment for African Americans. During the Civil War Belle told the people about the Woman's Right to vote and became friends with some other people, which one of them threaten that she would not support the issue. She spent the last few years of her life and died in Battle Creek, Michigan on November 26, 1883.
