Michael Dukakis

Michael Stanley Dukakis (, born November 3, 1933) served as the 65th and 67th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991. He is the longest-serving Governor in Massachusetts and only the second Greek-American governor in United States history, after Spiro Agnew. 

In 1988, he was the Democratic nominee for President, but lost to Republican thenâ€“Vice President, George H. W. Bush.

Dukakis was mentioned as candidate for Massachusetts Senator for a possible interim successor to Ted Kennedy, after Kennedy's death but Governor Deval Patrick chose Paul G. Kirk, the other candidate and a favorite of the Kennedy Family.

In 2008, he talked about his defeat in an interview with Katie Couric, in which he said he "owe[d] the American people an apology" because "if I had beaten the old man, we never would have heard of the kid, and we wouldn't be in this mess."
