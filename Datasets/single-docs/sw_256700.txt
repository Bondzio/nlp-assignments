John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band

John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is the first solo album by English rock musician John Lennon. It was released in 1970 after Lennon released three experimental albums with Yoko Ono and "Live Peace in Toronto 1969", a live show in Toronto credited to The Plastic Ono Band. The album was recorded at the same time with Yoko Ono's debut avant garde solo album "Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band" at Ascot Sound Studios and Abbey Road Studios using the same musicians and production team, and had nearly the same cover artwork. "John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band" is generally considered one of Lennon's best solo albums. "Rolling Stone" named it the twenty-second greatest album of all time.

All songs written by John Lennon.
