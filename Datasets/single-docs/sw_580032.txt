David Melech Friedman (born August 8, 1958) is an American bankruptcy lawyer. He is the United States Ambassador to Israel since May 15, 2017. 

Friedman joined the law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman (then known as Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson & Torres) in 1994, where he met and represented Donald Trump, then chairman and president of The Trump Organization. He served as an advisor to Trump during his successful presidential campaign.
