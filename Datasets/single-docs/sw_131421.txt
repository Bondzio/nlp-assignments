Napalm Death

Napalm Death are a heavy metal band from Meriden, West Midlands, England. They play a very loud and angry kind of heavy metal called Grindcore - a subgenre which they pioneered. The band made the shortest song in the world: 'You Suffer', which is only 1.316 seconds long - characteristic of grindcore. Their debut album, 'Scum', was revolutionary in the metal underground and was made up of songs, which on average, were about 20-60 seconds long.
