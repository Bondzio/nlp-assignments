Portmanteau word

A portmanteau word is made of other words, or parts of words. It comes from putting two (or more) other words together, like "motel", from "motor" and "hotel".

"Portmanteau" originally meant a type of suitcase with two separate parts for storage.
The first use as a word combination appeared in Lewis Carroll's book "Through the Looking-Glass". There Humpty Dumpty explains that some of the unusual words in "Jabberwocky" are other words packed together into one word, as two parts of a portmanteau suitcase are packed together.

"Portmanteau" itself is an example, combining the French words for carry (porter) and coat (manteau) into a coat carrier. "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of wiki (Hawaiian for fast) and encyclopedia.
