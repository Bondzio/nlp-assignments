Medical University of Innsbruck

The Medical University of Innsbruck (German: Medizinische Universität Innsbruck) is a university in Innsbruck, Austria. It used to be one of the four historical faculties of the Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck, but it became an independent (by itself) university in 2004.

The medical tradition dates back long before the university began. The first hospital began in the silver-mining city of Schwaz nearby in 1307. Because people grew as years went by, a medical faculty was added to the university, begun in 1669 by Emperor Leopold I, making it the first of its kind in the Alpine region.
