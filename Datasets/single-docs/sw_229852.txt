2010 Cauquenes earthquake

The 2010 Cauquenes earthquake was an earthquake that happened off the coast of Maule region of Chile, near Cauquenes, on February 27, 2010, at 3:34 local time (6:34 UTC). It is said to have lasted between ten and thirty seconds. At first, its magnitude was reported to be between 8.3 and 8.5 on the Moment magnitude scale, but this was later corrected upwards, to be at 8.8 of that scale. It was the strongest earthquake in Chile since the magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake, and the strongest earthquake worldwide since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. 

The epicenter of the earthquake was offshore from the Maule Region, approximately 8 km west of Curanipe and 115 km north-northeast of Chile's second largest city, Concepción. Also, the epicenter is less than 20 km due east from that of the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Other cities exposed to Mercalli intensity scale intensity VIII (Destructive) shaking were Arauco, Lota and Constitución.

The earthquake was also felt in the Chilean capital Santiago as well as in some Argentinean cities. Tsunami warnings were issued in 53 countries. Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile, declared a "state of catastrophe". She also confirmed the deaths of at least 795 people.

Chile was hit by another earthquake in March 11, 2010, with epicenter in the coastern town of Pichilemu, Province of Cardenal Caro, almost 200 kilometers from Santiago de Chile. It was MW 6,9 in the Richter scale.
