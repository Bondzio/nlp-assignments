Zoraptera

Zoraptera is a order of insects, is one of the least diverse and most poorly understood of insect lineages. Zoraptera are minute, hemimetabolous insects superficially resembling barklice (Psocoptera) or termites (Isoptera). 

Individuals are generally less than 3 mm in total body length, exclusive of their antennae, and are gregarious. Overall, zorapterans are quite homogenous in their morphology and tend to be off-white (mostly nymphs) to brown in color. Individuals of each species occur in two morphs: eyed and winged forms that then shed their wings after dispersal or blind and apterous forms that predominate in colonies.
