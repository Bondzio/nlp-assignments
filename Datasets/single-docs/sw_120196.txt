Erich Wasicky (May 27, 1911 in Vienna, Austria - May 28, 1947 in Landsberg) was a pharmacist at the Mauthausen concentration camp. He was responsible for killing many inmates.

Wasicky joined the NSDAP and the SS. From 1941 to 1944, he worked in the concentration-camp Mauthausen. He was in charge of choosing victims to be killed, and of poisoning them with the gas Zyklon-B. He also drove trucks that were used for killing people by exhaust gas. Up to 15,000 people had been killed at Mauthausen as well as neighboring Hartheim.

After the end of World War II he was charged with murder by an US-military tribunal, found guilty, and was hanged on May 28, 1947.
