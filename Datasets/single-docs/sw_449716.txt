Selfie

A selfie is a self-portrait photograph. It is typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone. 

Selfies are often shared on social networking services such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr. They are often casual, and are typically taken either with a camera held at arm's length or in a mirror. Some people use a "selfie stick" to hold the camera.

One of the first self-portraits was taken in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an American photographer. The term "selfie" was first used by photographer Jim Krause in 2005.

A black crested macaque ("Macaca nigra") snatched a camera, and took a photo of herself. The selfie seemed to establish a legal precedent when the Wikimedia Foundation rejected a copyright claim. The ground was that a non-human could not own a copyright, and the camera owner had not taken the photo, and so also could not own the copyright. Therefore the photo was not under copyright.
