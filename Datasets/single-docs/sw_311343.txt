Don Omar

Don Omar (born William Omar Landrón Rivera; February 10, 1978 in Puerto Rico ), is a reggaeton singer. He is believed to be one of the best reggaeton artists in Puerto Rico and all of Latin America by many music critics and fans alike. Omar is best known for his songs "Dile" and "Dale Don Dale" from his first album "The Last Don" and "Reggaeton Latino". His songs are mostly about life and love; some examples of these would be "La Recompenza" ("The Reward") and "Aunque te Fuiste" ("Even Though You Left Me").

He started his career after many obstacles when Héctor Delgado (from the duo Héctor & Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer for them. After that, he sang in a live concert with Héctor & Tito in 2003, which was released later as a CD and DVD, which included the songs that became instant hits, Baila Morena and Amor de Colegio (School Love). He is currently signed to VI Music through Universal Music Latino.
