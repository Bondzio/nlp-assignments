Professional wrestling holds

In professional wrestling, a hold is any kind of move used by a performer to stop their opponent from being able to moving. The hold may lead to a submission from the opponent. Some examples of holds are the cloverleaf (a kind of leglock), the keylock (a kind of armlock), and the guillotine choke (a kind of necklock or choke).
