38th G8 summit

The 38th G8 summit was held at Camp David, Maryland in the United States on May 18-19, 2012. The summit venue was moved from Chicago to rural Maryland in March 2012.

The Camp David summit of the Group of Eight (G8) was the 38th meeting in a series which began in 1976. 

Previous G8 summits have been hosted by the United States at San Juan, Puerto Rico (1976); Williamsburg, Virginia (1983); Houston, Texas, Denver, Colorado (1997) and Sea Island, Georgia.

The G8 leaders talked about making progress towards food security in Africa.

Traditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda.

Discussions at the 38th G8 summit included some issues from previous summits.

Planners anticipated protest groups and other activists. 

When the venue for the summit was changed from Chicago, a White House spokesman said security and the possibility of protests were not factors in the decision. Some protest groups took credit for the change of venue.

For some, the G8 summit was a profit-generating event; as for example, the "G8 Summit" magazines which have been published since 1998. 

Local businesses near Camp David are expecting more people in the area and profits because of the summit.
