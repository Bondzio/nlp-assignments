In "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" ("Sorcerer's Stone") Rickman portrays Professor Snape, a bad guy who hates Harry. Severus hated James Potter, Harry's father, because he took Lily from him, this is another reason he hates Harry so much because he looks like his father. However, in "Deathly Hallows Part 2" we discover that Snape is in fact a hero. He sacrifices himself to save the wizarding world. Harry recognises this and names a child after him in honour of his braveness.
