Pancho Villa

José Doroteo Arango Arámbula (5 June 1878 – 20 July 1923), better known by his nickname Pancho Villa, was a Mexican revolutionary leader who advocated for the poor and wanted agrarian reform. Though he was a killer, a bandit, and a revolutionary leader, many remember him as a folk hero. Pancho Villa was also responsible for a raid on Columbus, New Mexico in 1916, which was the first attack on U.S. soil since 1812. "Pancho" was a revolutionary advocate for the less fortunate.
