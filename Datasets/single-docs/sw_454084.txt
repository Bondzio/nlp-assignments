Jimmy Scott

James Victor "Jimmy" Scott (July 17, 1925 â€“ June 12, 2014), also known as "Little" Jimmy Scott, was an American jazz singer. He was known for his unusually high contralto voice. This is because he had Kallmann's syndrome, a very rare genetic condition. The condition prevented him from reaching puberty, leaving him with a high, undeveloped voice.

Scott died in Las Vegas, Nevada from cardiac arrest, aged 88.
