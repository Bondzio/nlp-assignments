Nature reserve

A nature reserve (preserve or (national/nature) conserve) is a protected area where wildlife, flora (plants) and fauna (animals), are left undisturbed. They may also protect geological features or other special interests. Reverves can also provide special opportunities for study or research. Nature reserves may be run by government institutions in some countries. They can also be created or run by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection given by local laws.
