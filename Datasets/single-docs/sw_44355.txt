Red panda

The red panda ("Ailurus fulgens") is a mammal. It is the only species of the Ailuridae family. There are two subspecies: "Ailurus fulgens fulgens" and "Ailurus fulgens styani". 

Most that are bred at Japanese zoos are "Ailurus fulgens styani". They are called レッサーパンダ in Japan and 小熊貓 (xiǎo xìong māo ) in China, both literally translating to English as "small bear cat". They have become popular for how they look. They are classed as 'Endangered'

The red panda is not closely related to the giant panda: they are in different families, but share a vegetarian diet. They have both adapted to eating plant material, which is unusual for members of the Carnivora.

The red panda lives in the southern part of China, Sikkim, Nepal, and the Himalaya mountains in high trees. In the Indian kingdom of Sikkim it is the state animal. As an endangered species it is protected by laws in the countries where it lives.

Red pandas are about 50-60 centimeters long. They weigh between three to five kilograms. They have chestnut colored hair, and their faces have white designs. They eat fruits, roots, bamboo shoots, acorns, and insects. They are active at night and sleep on trees in the daytime. They act alone, not in groups. They eat blossoms, berries, various plants, and bird eggs.
