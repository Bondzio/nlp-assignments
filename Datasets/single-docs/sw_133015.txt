Anaximenes of Miletus

Anaximenes () of Miletus (c. 585 BC-c. 525 BC) was a Greek Pre-Socratic philosopher from the latter half of the 6th century, probably a younger contemporary of Anaximander, whose pupil or friend he is said to have been.

Anaximenes, like others in his school of thought, practised material monism, the idea that underlying reality is one single thing.

For him, the primary substance was air. To us, this is obviously wrong, but it was an attempt to find a natural way to explain the world.
