World Trade Center

The World Trade Center (WTC) was a complex of buildings in Lower Manhattan, New York City, United States which was destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks; a new complex is currently under construction to replace the previous complex. The original buildings were designed by Minoru Yamasaki with Antonio Brittiochi. 

The biggest buildings in the original World Trade Center were the Twin Towers. The North Tower was the tallest building in the world when it was built. Later, the Willis Tower was built. The Twin Towers had 110 stories. They and 7 World Trade Center were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks and other buildings were damaged beyond repair. 

The World Trade Center site is mostly completed with the National September 11th Memorial and Museum, One World Trade Center replacing the North Tower, 7 World Trade Center replacing the original building 7 and 175 Greenwich Street replacing 4 World Trade Center, all complete. 

The original World Trade Center was designed by Minoru Yamasaki in the early 1960s using a tube-frame structural design for the twin 110-story towers. In gaining approval for the project, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed to take over the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad which became the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH). Groundbreaking for the World Trade Center took place on August 5, 1966. The North Tower, officially World Trade Center 1 was completed in December 1970 and the South Tower, officially World Trade Center 2 was finished in July 1971. Construction of the World Trade Center involved excavating a large amount of material that was then used in making Battery Park City on the west side of Lower Manhattan.
