Airfoil

An airfoil (in American English, or aerofoil in British English) is the shape of a wing, or blade of a propeller, the blade of a ship's screw or the shape of a sail as seen in cross-section. When moving through a fluid it will provide either lift. Lift is not only up, it may be in other directions depending on what it is used for.
