Cliff Burton

Clifford Lee Burton (February 10, 1962 â€“ September 27, 1986) was an American bassist and songwriter. He is best known for playing the bass guitar in the thrash metal band Metallica from 1982 until his death in 1986.

He died during a European tour when Metallica's tour bus skidded off the road and flipped over. Burton was thrown out of the bus' window and the bus fell on him. They attempted to rescue Burton from underneath the bus by lifting it with a crane, but the crane slipped, and the bus landed down on top of Burton a second time.
