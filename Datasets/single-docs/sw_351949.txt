Dardenne brothers

Brothers Jean-Pierre Dardenne (born 21 April 1951 in Liège, Belgium) and Luc Dardenne (born 10 March 1954 in Liège, Belgium) are a Belgian movie making duo. They write, produce and direct their movies together.

The Dardennes began making narrative and documentary movies in the late 1970s. They first came to international attention in the mid-1990s with "La Promesse" ("The Promise"). They won their first major international movie prize when "Rosetta" won the Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. All their movies since have played at the Cannes main competition and won one of the major prizes. They have won more awards than any other movie makers in the history of the Cannes Film Festival. 

In 2005, they won the Palme d'Or a second time for their movie "L’Enfant" ("The Child"). This put them in an elite group of only 7 with the likes of Francis Ford Coppola. 

Jean-Pierre is the jury president for the Cinéfoundation and Short Films sections of the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.
