Walter Keane

Walter Stanley Keane (October 7, 1915 â€“ December 27, 2000) was an American painter and plagiarist. He became famous in the 1950s for claiming he had painted a series of widely-reproduced paintings depicting vulnerable waifs with enormous eyes. The paintings were in fact painted by his wife Margaret Keane.
