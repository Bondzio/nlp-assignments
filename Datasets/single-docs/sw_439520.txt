Loni Nest

Loni Nest (born Eleonore Nest; August 4, 1915 - October 2, 1990) was a German actress.

She was born in Berlin to American parents. At the early age of four weeks, she was first featured in a movie. She used the name Loni Nest instead of Eleonore Nest. Between 1918 and 1933, she starred in 41 movies, opposite such actors as Charles Boyer, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Fritz Feld.

After more than 40 movies, she ended her movie career in 1928 at the early age of 13. In 1933 she played in one last movie in France.

Her whereabouts after 1933 remained unknown for several decades.

She died at the age of 75 on October 2, 1990 in the French town Nice.

In 2014, the website "Forever missed" published an obituary that ostensibly revealed that Nest had died on Hawaii in 2014 at the old age of 98. It also described details of Nest's life after she left Germany and moved to America. Various websites including the Internet Movie Database quickly adopted this information. However it was soon discovered, that both the time and location of her death as well as the details about her later life were completely made up.

According to the German newspaper Die Welt, German film historian Toni Schieck had discovered years before that Nest's sister Ursula had moved to the USA and died in Florida in 2007. Through her family, Schieck discovered that Nest had married and taken the last name Arnault. She moved to France where she died at the age of 75 in Nice.
