Jacques I, Prince of Monaco

Jacques Goÿon, Count of Matignon ("Jacques François Léonor"; 21 November 1689 – 23 April 1751) was Count of Thorigny and Matignon, as well as the Prince of Monaco as Jacques I after his marriage to the-then reigning Princess Louis Hippolyte of Monaco. He also contructed the Hôtel Matignon

Born in Normandy, his father was the Count of Matignon, a title that Jacques would inherit in 1675 Eventually Jacques would marry Princess Louise Hippolyte Grimaldi of Monaco

The children of the couple were technically given the surname of "Goyon" after their father however they were sometimes also known under the surname of Grimaldi too. 

Baptised with the names "Jacques François Léonor" and using the name Jacques, his surname was "simply" Goyon. His title was "Comte de Matignon" Therefore the mixture of Goyon and Matignon is unnecessary, and incorrect.
