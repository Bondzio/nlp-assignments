Sodium cyclamate

Sodium cyclamate is an artificial sweetener. It is 30 to 50 times sweeter than sugar. Even though other artificial sweeteners are more potent, sodium cyclamate is often used because of its taste, which is close to natuarally occurring sugar. Some studies have found that sodium cyclamate causes cancer. For this reason, its use is forbidden in the United States. In the European Union, the use in certain kinds of products is limited (to a maximal dose).
