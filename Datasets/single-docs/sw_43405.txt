Washing machine

A washing machine is a machine that washes dirty clothes. It contains a barrel into which the clothes are placed. This barrel is filled with water, and then rotated very quickly to make the water remove dirt from the clothes. Most washing machines are made so that detergent (liquids or powders) can be put into the machine. These can help make the clothes cleaner.

Washing machines often use technology to change how you want to wash.

There are two main types of washing machines. 
There are front load machines, where you put the clothes in the front.

There are also top load machines, where you put the clothes into the top.
Sometimes a washing machine and a clothes dryer are put together. The washing machine is usually on the bottom of the stack. It can be front load or top load.
