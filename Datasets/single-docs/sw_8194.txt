Trilogy

A trilogy is a series with three parts. For example, The Godfather series of movies is a trilogy because there are three movies in the series: "The Godfather", "The Godfather Part II", and "The Godfather Part III".

The trilogy was originally a tradition of Ancient Greek theatre, where three plays and one satyr play would be played.
