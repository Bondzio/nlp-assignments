Aenictogiton

Aenictogiton is a genus of ants. The genus has seven species. The genus is given its own subfamily, Aenictogitoninae. All of the species are known only from males from middle Africa and show a phylogenetic liking to the army ants (and are in the dorylomorph subfamilies). Nothing is known about the workers, queens and behavior of these ants. A few not described species are known to exist in a few collections in the world.
