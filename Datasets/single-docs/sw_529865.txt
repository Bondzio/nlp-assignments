Sick leave

Sick leave (or paid sick days or sick pay) is time off from work that workers can use to stay home because they are sick and they do not loose pay. Paid sick leave is a requirement in many nations around the world. Most European, many Latin American, a few African and a few Asian countries have legal requirements for paid sick leave. Already in 1500 BCE, at least some of the workers who built the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs received paid sick leave as well as state-supported health care.
