Rupert Everett

Rupert Everett (Rupert James Hector Everett, born 29 May 1959) is an English actor, singer and writer. He became famous when he appeared in Julian Mitchell's play and movie "Another Country" playing an openly homosexual student at an English public school in the 1930s. He has since appeared in many other works, including "My Best Friend's Wedding", "The Next Best Thing" and the "Shrek" sequels.

Everett left school at 16 and ran away to London to become an actor. In order to support himself, he worked as a prostitute for drugs and moneyâ€”he disclosed this information in an interview for "US" magazine in 1997. After being dismissed from the Central School of Speech and Drama, he travelled to Scotland and got a job at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow.

In the 21st century, Everett has been writing. He has been a "Vanity Fair" contributing editor, has written for "The Guardian" and wrote a film screenplay on playwright Oscar Wilde's final years.

In 2006 Everett published a memoir, "Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins", in which he reveals his six-year affair with British television presenter Paula Yates. Although he is sometimes described as bisexual, as opposed to homosexual, he described his heterosexual affairs during a radio show with Jonathan Ross as the result of adventurousness: "I was basically adventurous, I think I wanted to try everything".

Everett criticised the introduction of same-sex marriage, claiming, "I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster".
