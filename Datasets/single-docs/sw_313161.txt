O Holy Night

"O Holy Night" is a Christmas oriented song. It was created to celebrate the renovation of the church organ in the town of Roquemaure, France. Placide Cappeau, a French wine merchant and poet, wrote a poem in 1843. He called it "Minuit, chr√©tiens" ("Midnight, Christians"). The poem reflects the birth of Jesus and tells about the redemption of mankind. The music was made by Adolphe Adam around 1847. Notable singers of the song include, although are not limited to, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and others.
