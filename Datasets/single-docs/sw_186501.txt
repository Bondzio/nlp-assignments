The 777-200 was the first and original type of 777s. It was first flown on June 12, 1994 and entered service with United Airlines on June 7, 1995. It was made to fly up to 440 people in a single class layout, and could fly 5240 nautical miles (9700 km). 88 777-200 were made, with no -200 waiting to be made.

The 777-200ER is an extended range version of the original 777-200. This means it could fly longer than the original version. Although the number of passengers able to be carried remains the same, the range of the -200ER is increased to 7725 nautical miles (14305 km). 422 -200ER were made, with no -200ER waiting to be made.
