Abilene Eagles

The Abilene Eagles were a West Texas League minor league baseball team. They were based in Abilene, Texas, USA from 1920 to 1922. They won the league championship in both 1920 and 1921. The team managers for those years were Bugs Young and Ed Kizziar (1920) and Grady White and Hub Northen (1921). They finished in sixth place in 1922. The league folded following the 1922 season, and the Eagles followed suit.

Future major league baseball player Fred Johnson played for the Eagles.
