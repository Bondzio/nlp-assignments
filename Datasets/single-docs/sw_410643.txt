Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom

Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom began on 29 March 2014 resulting from the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) act of 2013. This act allows same-sex couples to marry in England and Wales. Scotland introduced same-sex marriage on 16 December 2014 for partners converting civil partnerships becoming married, but for other couples the same-sex wedding ceremonies occurred on 31 December 2014 which is Hogmanay. Northern Ireland, however, does not allow same-sex marriage. Proposals to change that have failed. Civil partnerships began in 2005 across the UK, permitting benefits similar to marriage for same-sex couples.
