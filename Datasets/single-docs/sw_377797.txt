Dina Manfredini

Dina Manfredini (née Guerri, 4 April 1897 – 17 December 2012) was an Italian American supercentenarian, who was the world's oldest living person from the death of Besse Cooper on 4 December 2012 until her own death 13 days later. Although a newphew of her successor, Jiroemon Kimura, has claimed that Kimura was born one month earlier than the date of his records and before Manfredini, Guinness World Records still recognise him according to his birth records, making Manfredini officially the oldest person in the world from 4-17 December 2012. As a supercentenarian, Manfredini also achieved the following records:

Manfredini was born in Pievepelago, Modena, Emilia-Romagna. She moved to Des Moines, Iowa in 1920 with her husband Riccardo Manfredini, whom she raised four children with. She worked in an ammunition factory during World War II and cleaned houses until she was 90. Her husband died at the age of 79 in 1965, when she was 67. After her husband's death she lived alone until moving into a nursing home at the age of 110. 
On the morning of 17 December 2012, at around 9:30am, Manfredini died from natural infection at the age of 115 years, 257 days. Three of her children were still living at the time of her death, as well as 7 grandchildren, 7 great-grandchildren and 12 great-great-grandchildren.
