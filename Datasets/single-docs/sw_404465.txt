Powhatan

Powhatan (? - ?) was the leader of the Powhatan tribe. Powhatan was the leader during the Jamestown Colonization when the English settled in Jamestown in 1607. Powhatan was friendly with the English at the beginning. He traded with them. Powhatan usually sent his daughter Pocahontas to give them corn/maize. But later, Powhatan and his tribe looked at the settlers as invaders. After that, Powhatan did not allow the trading with the English settlers. From 1610-1612, it was known as the Starving Time. His leadership was saved by his brother Opchanacanough.
