News Radio UK

News Radio UK is a British digital radio station that is owned by Radio NewsHub, Radio Today and Radio Response. Branding as "UK's only 24 hour rolling news service", News Radio UK features news, weather, traffic, sports, showbiz and business summaries on a continuous loop. In addition to its availability on DAB (in Portsmouth only), the station's programming is streamed live on the network's website, and through apps for Apple, Android, and Kindle devices; plus on Radioplayer and Tunein.

In September 8, 2016, Radio NewsHub had a plan to launch UK's first rolling news station. Its format would be designed for occasional listens during the day, and covered all the day's most important news every 10 minutes. The contents are produced by three owners, with the traffic information presented from INRIX.

In October 10, 2016, the station was officially launched at 10am on DAB service in Portsmouth first.

News Radio UK maintains a "wheel" schedule, which is in a 10-minute block, updated continuously throughout the day. The order of broadcast is: national news - world news - sports - travel - business - showbiz - weather.

The presenters are rotated depending on the current time period.
