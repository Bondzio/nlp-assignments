Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move

Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a puzzle video game for the Nintendo 3DS game console. It is the fifth game in the "Mario vs. Donkey Kong" series. It was released on Nintendo's eShop service on May 9, 2013 in Europe and North America, and July 24, 2013 in Japan.

In the main game, the player has to place blocks on a grid with the goal of making a path for a Mini (a small walking robot that looks like Mario or another character in the "Mario" series) to get from a warp pipe to the goal. The player has to avoid obstacles like Shy Guys and spikes. Each level has three colored coins that the player can collect. Collecting all three coins gives the player a star token. Star tokens can be used to unlock more gameplay modes, levels, and toys. There are more than 180 levels in four modes of gameplay. There are also four minigames that can be unlocked.

The game has a level creation mode where the player can create their own levels using pieces from the game. They can also control how often tiles fall. Created levels can be saved and shared using StreetPass after the player is able to complete the level that they have created. The levels can also be shared through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, where players can download levels created by other players.
