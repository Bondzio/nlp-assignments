University of Prishtina

The University of Prishtina is at present the name of two disjoint public universities in Kosovo, sharing the same history up to a point of separation, which took place in 1999. The university was founded in the city of Prishtina 1970 and as result of pervasive ethnic-based polarisation segregated. The two separate, disjoint institutions are using the same name, in Prishtina (Pri≈°tina) and Mitrovica.
