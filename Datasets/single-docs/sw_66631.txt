Roman Curia

The Roman Curia ( Curia Romanae) is usually called "The Curia". It is the cabinet of Vatican City and the Roman Catholic Church.

Parts of The Curia look after the independent country of the Vatican. For example, The Curia includes the Vatican's courts.

Other parts of The Curia do jobs that are important for the Catholic Church. For example, the "Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity" is in charge of meeting other churches.

All of the parts of The Curia that are listed on the Vatican's website are explained in this table.
