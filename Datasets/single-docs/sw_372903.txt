Henry Charles Andrews

Henry Charles Andrews (fl. 1794 - 1830), was an English botanist, and an artist who illustrated plants.

He lived in Knightsbridge. He was married to the daughter of John Kennedy of Hammersmith, a nurseryman who helped Andrews to write descriptions of the plants he illustrated.

Andrews was a good and unusual botanical artist. He was not only an artist, but also engraver, colorist, and publisher in a time when most artists were only employed to make small drawings. The "Botanist's Repository" was his first publication. It was issued in London in a series of ten volumes between 1797 and 1812. It provided affordable images of plants to the growing population of amateur gardeners in Britain. The Kew publication, "Curtis's Botanical Magazine", wrote that Andrews' work was very accurate. Andrews' images have a more artistic appeal compared to the publications of his rival, which were focused more on scientific descriptions.
