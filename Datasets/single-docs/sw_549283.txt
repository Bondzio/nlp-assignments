Year 100 problem

The Year 100 problem (also known as the Y1C problem) was a problem that happened because of the way in which some early computer programs were made in Taiwan. They were made to handle only years containing 2 digits of the Minguo calendar system, and people started fearing that date-related processing would happen incorrectly for dates and times starting with the year 100, which is equiavalen to the year 2011 by the Common Era. It caused a big concern that very important industries (such as electricity or financial) and government functions would stop working at exactly midnight, January 1 100, and on other critical dates which were called "event horizons". However, primarily the government sector restricted themselves to using the Minguo calendar system, so it didn't affect a majority of the private sector. More people were panicked by press coverage and other media speculation, as well as corporate and government reports. Companies and organisations in Taiwan had to check and upgrade their computer systems. The preparation for Y1C thus had a significant effect on the Taiwanese computer industry. No significant computer failures occurred when the year changed to 100. Debate continues on whether the absence of computer failures was the result of the preparation undertaken or whether the problem had been overstated.
