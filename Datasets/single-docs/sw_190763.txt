One World Trade Center

The One World Trade Center (or Freedom Tower) is the main building of the new World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The building is 1,776Â feet tall and is designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Since late 2013, it is the tallest building in the United States. It opened in late 2014. It is mostly used for offices. People can view the city from an observatory near the top.

On November 8, 2013, a debate started between architects across Chicago and New York City debating about the height of the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower. They were saying that there was a possibility that the Willis Tower is taller than the One World Trade Center.

On November 12, a committee agreed that the antenna on top is part of the building, so One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower.
