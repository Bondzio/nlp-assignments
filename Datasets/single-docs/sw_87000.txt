David Honeyboy Edwards

David "Honeyboy" Edwards (June 28, 1915 â€“ August 29, 2011) was an American blues guitarist and singer. Honeyboy was the last original Delta Blues guitarists still performing.

Edwards was born in Shaw, Mississippi, United States. He was friends with Robert Johnson, and was with him when he died. 

Culture expert Alan Lomax recorded Edwards in 1942 for the first time. In his later years, Honeyboy still played concerts around the world, sometimes up to 100 concerts a year. He died on August 29, 2011 in Chicago, Illinois from congestive heart failure, at the age of 96 years. 

Edwards has also written a book, "The World Don't Owe Me Nothin'," which was published in 1997 by Chicago Review Press. The book is about his life from childhood to when he arrived in Chicago. It describes his journeys through the South in the early 1950s.


His albums "White Windows", "The World Don't Owe Me Nothing", "Mississippi Delta Blues Man", and Henry Townsend were all nominated for the W. C. Handy Award.
