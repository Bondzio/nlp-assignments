Pickerel frog

The pickerel frog is a small frog in North America. It has dark squares on its back. The squares are in lines instead of randomly scattered. Leopard frogs have circular spots. They have an orange or yellow coloration on the inside of their back legs. They are mainly found in the eastern United States, with a little in southern Canada. They have toxic glands in their skin that can kill other frogs.
