Four Freedoms

The Four Freedoms is an important concept of American president Franklin D. Roosevelt. He presented them in the "State of the Union" of January 6, 1941, which is therefore also called the "Four Freedoms Speech".

Roosevelt made the "Four Freedoms" public just eleven months before the American participation at World War II. The concept played an important role in the American propaganda during the war. After Roosevelts death in 1945, his wife Eleanor continued being an important advocate for including the "Four Freedoms" in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

To inspire a greater public for his concept, Roosevelt arranged the creation of the Four Freedoms Monument. The statue was made public in 1943 in New York City. In honor of one of the first Americans to be killed in action in World War II, Colin Kelly, Roosevelt had the statue moved to Kelly's former home in Florida.

In 1943 artist painter Norman Rockwell got inspired by the "Four Freedoms" and made a series of four paintings on this subject. Afterwards, the American authorities made use of these paintings to collect money for the world war.
