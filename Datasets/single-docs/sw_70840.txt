Gothic language

The Gothic language is an extinct Germanic language that was spoken by the Goths. It is the East Germanic language with the biggest number of texts surviving today. It had died out by the 8th century, perhaps the early 9th century.

Probably one of the best known works of the language is Wulfila's translation of the Bible. This work is known as the Wulfila Bible (or "Gothic Bible"). This translation was done in the 3rd century.
