Hurricane Inez

Hurricane Inez was a very deadly late season hurricane. This storm happened late September to mid October 1966. Inez had winds of just over 150 miles an hour (almost Category 5 level). The storm went across Cuba, the Florida Keys, Hispaniola, and Mexico. Inez killed over 1,000 people. It caused $226.5 million (1966 USD) in damage.

The name Inez was retired the next spring.
