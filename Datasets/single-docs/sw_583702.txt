Party for Japanese Kokoro

The Party for Japanese Kokoro (Japanese: 日本のこころを大切にする党 "Nippon no Kokoro wo Taisetsu ni Suru Tō," which literally means "The party that cares for Japan's heart") is a political party in Japan.

The Japan Restoration Party was formed on 12 September 2012 and was lead by mayor of Osaka, Tōru Hashimoto, and Shintaro Ishihara. The party split in 2014 due to a disagreement over a merger with another party. Ishihara left to form the Party for Future Generations (Japanese: 次世代の党 "Jisedai no Tō") on 1 August 2014.

The party lost many seats in the 2014 Japanese general election. They received 2.65% of the vote. Ishihara announced his retirement from politics two days after the election.

According to Ayako Mie, the party's policies are "a mix of conservative security policies, stricter immigration laws and advocacy of traditional values on the one hand, and 'liberalism' in economic areas on the other, such as pursuing regulatory reform." The party is also patriotic. The party is seen as right-wing or far-right.

The current party leader is Kyoko Nakayama.
