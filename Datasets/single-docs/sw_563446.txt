Brahmanas

The Brahmanas are a collection of Indian books. The books give more information on the Vedas, the four holiest books of the Hindu religion.

The "Brahmanas" give instructions on the proper performance of rituals. They also explain the original symbolic meanings.

Each Vedic "shakha" (school) has its own "Brahmana". Many "Brahmana" texts existed in ancient India. Most of these have been lost.
