Tokugawa Yoshimune

Yoshimune was the son of Tokugawa Mitsusada, the grandson of Tokugawa Yorinobu, and the great-grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Yoshimune was the eighth shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Yoshimune's government worked to control the price of rice. This earned him the nickname "Rice Shogun" or "Shogun of Rice" ("kome-sh≈çgun").
