Snow skin mooncake

Snow skin mooncake (Also known as Snowy mooncake, Ice skin mooncake or Crystal mooncake) is a Chinese food which is often eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival. A bakery in Hong Kong created snow skin mooncakes in 1989.

Snow skin mooncake is not baked. Traditional mooncakes are made with egg yolks and lotus seed paste. Therefore, there is a lot of sugar and oil in them. Because some customers think traditional mooncakes are oily, the bakery used fruit for filling. Also, less oil is used to make a healthier mooncake.
