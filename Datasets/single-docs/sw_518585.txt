Dither fish

Dither fish are aquarium fish used by cichlid owners to make some species of cichlids less timid. 

Dither fish usually swim around the top of a tank. This behavior encourages more timid fish to relax and venture out more. The timid fish think (correctly) that no predators are around. 

The technique relies on the ability of cichlids in an aquarium to use the behaviour of other fish species as a sign that the environment is safe. Good dither fish are typically schooling species, such as some "Danio" species, barbs and some tetra species.
