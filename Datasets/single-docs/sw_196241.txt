Andalusian nationalism

Andalusian nationalism called "Andalucismo" in Spanish, is the name given to the political separatist movement in the Iberian Peninsula. It wants the Andalusia people to be recognized as a "nation". The main political party is the Andalusian Nationalists Party but there are also smaller political groups supporting Andalusian nationalism, including "Nación Andaluza" and "Asamblea Nacional de Andalucía".
