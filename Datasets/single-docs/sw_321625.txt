Cuban Revolution

The Cuban Revolution was an armed revolt led by Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement. It was against the government of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. The revolt took place between 1953 and 1959. Batista was finally removed from office on January 1, 1959. He was replaced by a revolutionary government led by Castro. This government later changed along communist lines, and became the current Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965.

The revolt started with the assault on the Moncada Barracks on July 26, 1953. It ended on January 1, 1959, when Batista was forced to leave the country and Santa Clara and Santiago de Cuba were taken by rebels. Che Guevara and Fidel Castro's surrogates Raúl Castro and Huber Matos led the rebels. Guevara led the group at Santa Clara. Raúl Castro and Matos led the rebels at Santiago de Cuba.
