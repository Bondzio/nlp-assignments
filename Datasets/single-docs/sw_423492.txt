List of monarchs of Mercia

The Kingdom of Mercia was an important monarchy in the English Midlands from the 6th century to the 10th. From the mid-7th century until it ceased to exist as a kingdom, Mercia was the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Some of its rulers were the first to claim titles such as "King of the English" and "King of Britain". Mercia was one of the seven kingdoms of the . This is a later name given to the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England during the early Middle Ages. Besides Mercia it included Northumbria, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, and Sussex.

The first of Mercian kings are called the Iclingas. The name comes from Icel who ruled the Mercians . Members of this dynasty claimed to be descendants the royal family of their homeland in Western Europe. Mercia became a dominant force under Penda from about until his death in 655. Bretwalda, his son, was the first Mercian overlord of the southern English. Offa (757â€“796), was the first of the Anglo-Saxon kings who might rightly be called "king of the English". Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign. For their successors in England see List of English monarchs.


When the Iclingas line died out in the male line, members of other noble Mercian families competed for the throne. The 'B' dynasty is for kings Beornwulf, Berhtwulf and Burgred. The 'W' dynasty is for king Wiglaf. Others have no dynasty they are connected with.


After being defeated by Alfred the Great, the king of Wessex, the rulers were no longer considered kings and queens but rather ealdormen. The title of the female rulers was "Lady of the Mercians." They were styled Kings and Queens in Mercia only.


After Mercia became an annex of Wessex (Mercia was no longer a kingdom), 'King of Mercia' became a title only.
