Subsistence farming

Subsistence farming is the kind of farming done by farmers who have small plots, enough only for themselves. In subsistence agriculture, no extra food is produced to sell or trade. This means farming doesn't give them money to buy things. Subsistence farming may be shifting farming or nomadic herding (see nomadic people).
