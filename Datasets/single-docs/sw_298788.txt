Harold Gresley

Harold Gresley (1892 - 1967) was an English artist. His father and grandfather were also artists. He painted mainly landscapes but also some portraits.

Gresley was born in Derbyshire and studied in Derby art school. He was the son of Frank Gresley and grandson of James Stephen Gresley who were both notable artists. He stopped his studies when World War I started. He fought in the Sherwood Foresters and was awarded a medal. After the war he continued his studies in Nottingham under Arthur Spooner, and became a teacher at Repton School. He lived at Chellaston, near Derby until he died in 1967.

Some of his work is shown in Derby Museum and Art Gallery after 77 of his paintings were donated by art collector Alfred E. Goodey.
