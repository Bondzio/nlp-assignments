Social spider

A social spider is a species of spider which lives in a group. Most spiders are solitary, but a few species in tropical habitats live in large groups. 

This social organisation has evolved independently a number of times. At least 23 species in eight families are known.

These spiders have not developed a caste system, and so they are not classed as eusocial. The first one was discovered over a century ago by Eugène Simon (30 April 1848 – 17 November 1924). This French naturalist described over 4,000 species of spider.
