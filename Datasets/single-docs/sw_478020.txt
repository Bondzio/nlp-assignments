Australian twenty-cent coin

The twenty-cent coin was part of the Australian decimal currency system. It replaced the florin on the 14th of February, 1966. The florin was for two shillings. As the system changed, the Australian pound became worth two Australian dollars.

On the obverse side, there is the Queen Elizabeth of Australia. On the other side, there is a platypus, the mascot used for national events.
