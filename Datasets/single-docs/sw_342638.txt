Australian House of Representatives

The House of Representatives is the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The upper house is the Senate. Members of Parliament (MPs) serve for terms of about three years. There are 150 members. Each member represents one electorate. The number of electorates is figured out so that it is in proportion to the population of each state/territory. and so that each one has roughly the same population. This is determined by the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission)
