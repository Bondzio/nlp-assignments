Cumberland Mountains

The Cumberland Mountains are a mountain range in the southeastern part of the Appalachian Mountains. They run from northern Tennessee to West Virginia. They include parts of western Virginia and eastern Kentucky. Their highest peak, with an elevation of above sea level, is High Knob near Norton, Virginia. According to the United States Geological Survey, the Cumberland Mountain range is long and wide. It is bounded by the Russell Fork on the northeast, the Pound River and Powell River on the southeast, Cove Creek on the southwest, and Tackett Creek, the Cumberland River, Poor Fork Cumberland River, and Elkhorn Creek on the northwest. It forms the part of the boundary between Kentucky and Virginia. The Cumberland Mountains were named for England's Duke of Cumberland. There are a large number of limestone caves on the Virginia side.
