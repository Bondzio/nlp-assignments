Nagorno-Karabakh Republic

The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) ( ') or Artsakh Republic"' is a "de facto" independent republic in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the South Caucasus.

The Nagorno-Karabakh region has been populated by Armenians for a long time. The area has been disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan since 1918. After the Soviet Union established control over the area, in 1923 it formed the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR. In the final years of the Soviet Union, the region again became a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, resulting in the Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988â€“1994.

On 10 December 1991, a referendum was held in the NKAO and the neighboring Shahumian region. This resulted in a declaration of independence from Azerbaijan as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The country is not recognized by any UN member state, including Armenia. Representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group.
