Lamrim

Lamrim (Tibetan: "stages of the path") is a Tibetan Buddhist text which presents the stages in the complete path to enlightenment as taught by Buddha. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of "lamrim", presented by different teachers of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug schools. However, all versions of the "lamrim" are elaborations of Ati≈õa's 11th Century root text "A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment".

There is a project to expand the Lamrim Teachings with several translated texts.
