Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids

Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids (also called Nickelodeon GAS, Nick GAS, or GAS) was an American cable television network. It was part of MTV Networks's digital cable channels, and was available to all companies that provide digital cable and to Dish Network.

Nick GAS started on March 1, 1999. Dave Aizer (1999–2003), Vivianne Collins (1999–2003), and later Mati Moralejo (2001–2005) were the network's first on-air hosts.

Nick GAS focused on Nickelodeon game shows, which by 2000 were no longer available on the main Nickelodeon network. It was basically a children's version of Game Show Network, which had started in 1994.

On December 31, 2007, Nick GAS was discounted and was replaced by The N, which splitted from Noggin. However, Dish Network continued to air Nick GAS until April 23, 2009.
