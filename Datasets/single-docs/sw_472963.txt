Ventnor

Ventnor () is a seaside resort and civil parish on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It was established in the Victorian era. Ventnor lies underneath St Boniface Down. At it is the highest point on the Isle of Wight. Ventnor is built on steep slopes and cliffs leading down to the sea. The higher part is called Upper Ventnor. The lower part is simply known as Ventnor. Ventnor is sometimes understood as including the coastal villages of St. Lawrence to one side and Bonchurch to the other.

The sheltered location on the cliff of the Island's south coast means the area experiences a microclimate. It has more sunny days than much of the British Isles, and fewer frosts. This has allowed many species of subtropical plant to grow here. Ventnor Botanic Garden is particularly notable.
