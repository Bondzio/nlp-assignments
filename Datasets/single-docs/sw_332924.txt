Indoor Football League

The Indoor Football League (IFL) is a professional indoor American football league created in 2008 out of the combination of the Intense Football League and United Indoor Football. For the 2011 season the league had 22 teams in 14 different U.S. states. The 2012 season has 16 teams. There championship is called the United Bowl. They play games in the Spring.

In 2008, the league was created due to tension between in the Intense Football League and United Indoor Football League.

The 2009 IFL United Bowl had the Intense Conference champs, the Billings Outlaws, against the upset-minded United Conference River City Rage. Scoring was common. The Outlaw defense had a pick in the 2nd quarter which led to another offensive touchdown and two score lead by halftime. The Rage fought back though, recovering an onside kick at the beginning of the 3rd quarter and driving the ball the length of the field for a touchdown. That would be the closest the game would get for the Rage. The Outlaws would put up just enough points to keep a comfortable lead throughout the fourth quarter and after recovering an onside kick in the last minute of the game, the Outlaws kneeled the ball and took home the crown with a score of 71-62 in a loud, sold out Rimrock Auto Arena.

In the 2010 IFL United Bowl, the Billings Outlaws of the Intense Conference took the league championship by beating Sioux Falls Storm of the United Conference 43-34 in front of a sold out crowd in the Billings Sportsplex (a training facility, used by the Outlaws after their arena suffered storm damage).

The IFL got more attention when former National Football League star wide receiver Terrell Owens joined the Allen Wranglers of the IFL for the 2012 season.
