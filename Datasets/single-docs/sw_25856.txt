Cursor

A cursor is a shape on a computer screen that shows where actions made with the keyboard or mouse will make a change.

There are 2 types of cursor that most people will use.



The computer automatically moves the cursor one space to the right when a letter, number or symbol is typed. The cursor can be moved to the start of the next line by pressing the Enter Key.

Most Keyboards also have 4 cursor keys to move the text cursor up, down, left or right.
