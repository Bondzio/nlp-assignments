Ketuvim

Ketuvim (in Biblical Hebrew: "writings") is the third and final section of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), after Torah (instruction) and Nevi'im (prophets). 

The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the Ruach HaKodesh (the holy spirit of holy spirit of YHWH), but they have less importance the prophecy.
