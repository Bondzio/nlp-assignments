F.C. Barcelona B

F.C. Barcelona B is the reserve team of F.C. Barcelona. They compete in the Segunda División B, the third division of Spanish association football, after being relegated from the Segunda División in the 2014-15 season finishing in 22nd place.
Barça B was originally founded on 1 August 1934, as "Societat Esportiva Industrial Espanya". It was owned by a textile company of the same name. In 1945, the company agreed with FC Barcelona to make the club Barça's reserve team. They were promoted to La Liga in 1953, but decided to stay in Segunda División. In 1956, they won promotion again, and since teams with names of companies were not allowed, they changed their name to CD Condal.

In 1970, they decided to merge Condal with Atlètic Catalunya and formed Barcelona Atlètic. They reached Segunda División B and Segunda División after 1974. In 1991, Barcelona Atlètic was then renamed FC Barcelona B. In 2008, they were named Barcelona Atlètic once again when Pep Guardiola brought them to Segunda División B, and then once again named FC Barcelona B when they were promoted to Segunda División.
