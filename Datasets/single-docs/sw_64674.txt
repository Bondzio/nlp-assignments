Amir Khosrow

Hakīm Abul-Hasan Yamīn al-Dīn Khusrow Balkhi Dehlavi (1253-1325) () or Amir Khosrow is a Persian poet. Amir Khusrow lived in Delhi. His poems are in Persian and Hindi. 

Allaudin Khilji (1296 A.D - 1316 A.D) had a court minister named Hazrat Amir Khusro who was highly gifted in music with an exceptionally innovative mind. To put it in brief, his contribution to Hindustani Classical Music is unmatched. It is said that he created the Sitar (probably inspired by the Veena and other string instruments of Persia). The modification of the Pakhawaj into the Tabla is also credited to him.

It has also been said that Amir Khusro introduced many styles of singing including Khayal, Tarana, Ghazal and Qawali. He is credit for some most popular Ragas like Yaman, Poorya and Poorvi.
