Peking Man

Peking Man (currently "Homo erectus pekinensis") is an example of "Homo erectus". The remains were first found between in 1923 and 1937 during excavations at Zhoukoudian near Beijing, in China. 

In 2009 the finds were dated from roughly 750,000 years ago, and a new Al/Be dating suggests they are in the range of 680,000â€“780,000 years old.

The original fossils disappeared in 1941, but casts and descriptions remain.
