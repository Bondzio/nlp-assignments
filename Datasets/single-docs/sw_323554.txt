Inverness Airport

Inverness Airport is an international airport at Dalcross, 7 nautical miles (~8 miles or 13 km) north east of the city of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. 

The airport is the main gateway for travellers to the Highlands and Islands. There are a wide range of scheduled services throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland; also there are limited charter and freight flights to continental Europe. 591,397 passengers passed through the airport in 2009. It is owned by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) who own most of the regional airports in mainland Scotland and the outlying islands.

Like many of the airports in the Highlands and Islands, this airport was originally a RAF air base, and played a role in World War II. It was converted to civilian use in 1947.
