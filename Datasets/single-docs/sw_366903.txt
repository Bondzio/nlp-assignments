WorldCat

WorldCat is an online catalog stystem which lists the combined collections of 70,000+ libraries in 170 countries. 

WorldCat was built by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), which is a global cooperative of libraries. WorldCat is maintained by the group of libraries. 

In the 1970s, OCLC grew from a regional computer system for 54 Ohio colleges into an international network. 

In 1979, the first Canadian and the first international library joined OCLC.

On August 26, 1971, the OCLC Online Union Catalog, now called WorldCat, went online.
