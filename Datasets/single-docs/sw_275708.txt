Mezzanine

Mezzanine is the third studio album by English trip hop group Massive Attack, released on 20 April 1998. It was produced by Neil Davidge along with the group. The album was released on Virgin Records.

The entire album was provided on their website for legal download many months before the CD release was announced. It was one of the first major uses of the MP3 format by a commercial organization.
It does not use the jazzy sounds and the rapping of Tricky in "Blue Lines" and "Protection", leaving in favour a dark sound, heavy bass lines and distorted guitars.
