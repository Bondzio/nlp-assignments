Time of the Season

"Time of the Season" (where the breaths, sighs and flutish pianish organ were heard) is a single from The Zombies. It is a ballad about emotions in the Summer of Love. Colin Blunstone is lead singer.

The song hit #3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and #1 in Canada. It did not chart in Britain.

The song was sampled and covered by quite a few artists in the years after.
