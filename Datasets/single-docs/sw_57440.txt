Figure of speech

A figure of speech is a way of saying a message. Many figures of speech are not meant to be understood exactly as they are said: they are not literal, factual statements.

Linguists call these figures of speech "tropes" -- a play on words, using words in a way that is different from its accepted literal or normal form. DiYanni wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different "figures of speech", expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense". 

Metaphors are very common examples. A common figure of speech is to say that someone "threw down the gauntlet". This does not mean that a person threw a protective wrist-covering down on the ground. Instead, it usually means that the person issued a public challenge to another person (or many persons).

It is also suggested that a figure of speech serves two roles
(a)ORNAMENTATION
(b)CLEARNESS
