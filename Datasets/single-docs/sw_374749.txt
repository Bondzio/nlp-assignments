Nimravides

Nimravides was a prehistoric saber-toothed cat which lived in North America during the middle and late Miocene. Despite its scientific name "Nimravides" does not belong to the Nimravidae, but belongs to the family Felidae.

The earlier species of the genus are smaller and more primitive than the later forms. The tiger-sized "Nimravides catacopsis" resembles the primitive "Machairodus aphanistus", a species known from the late Miocene of Eurasia.
