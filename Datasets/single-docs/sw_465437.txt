Prince of Asturias

Prince of Asturias (, ) is the traditional title given to the heir to the Spanish throne. John I of Castile first gave the title to his oldest son, prince Henry (Henry III of Castile) in 1388. The title lapsed in 1931 when the monarchy was overthrown. Military dictator Francisco Franco appointed Juan Carlos de Borb√≥n as his "successor with the title of King". But he gave him the new title of "Prince of Spain" instead of Prince of Asturias. In 1977 the title was given to Felipe VI of Spain, who was the eldest son and then heir apparent of King Juan Carlos I.
