Hurricane Edouard (1996)

Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane in 1996. Its winds reached 145 miles an hour. Edouard was at major hurricane status for around eight days. The storm was originally forecast to slam the Northeastern United States, but it was much less severe there. Edouard generated strong waves that killed two people on the coastal shore of New Jersey. The southeast coast of Massachusetts received minor hurricane force winds that caused minimal damage on Nantucket Island. The name Edouard was not retired due to lack of serious damage. The name was used again in the 2002 and 2008 hurricane seasons, and will be again during 2014.
