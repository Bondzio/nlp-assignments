You Suffer

"You Suffer" is a song by the British grindcore band Napalm Death. It is from their debut album, "Scum". "Guinness Book of Records" has mentioned the song as the shortest recorded song ever. It is precisely 1.316 seconds long.

The song was written by band members Nicholas Bullen and Justin Broadrick. This was during the sessions for the "From Enslavement to Obliteration" demo recording in March 1986. The song is featured on the album "Scum", released in 1987.

According to Broadrick, "You Suffer" was meant as a joke. He called it "retarded", "ridiculous" but "hilarious". He added that they played the song "in front of 30 local kids, like, every weekend." for about thirty times.

Nic Bullen said that the short length of the song was inspired by Wehrmacht's 1985 song "E!"

Zak Smith quotes the lyrics to the song, which he describes as the ""shortest" punk song on the subject of suffering (or any subject)" at the conclusion of his memoir "We Did Porn".

A music video produced by Earache records was released for the song in March 2007. This was on the same day that the "Scum" dualdisc was released.
