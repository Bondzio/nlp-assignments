Mimikyu

Mimikyu is a Pokémon which was first encountered in the game Pokémon sun or Pokémon moon

Mimikyu is one of the strangest Pokémon as its true identity is hidden under the disguise it has on

there has been many fan arts of what fans believed to be Mimikyu's true form but recently in a anime episode it is shown that he is a ghostly orb and if you look at his yellow eyes you die of shock
