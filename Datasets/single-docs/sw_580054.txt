Ogden R. Reid

Ogden Rogers Reid (born June 24, 1925) is an American politician. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York from January 3, 1963 through January 3, 1975. Before, he served as the United States Ambassador to Israel from July 2, 1959 through January 19, 1961 during the Dwight D. Eisenhower presidency.

Reid was born in New York City, New York. He graduated from Deerfield Academy and Yale University. 

Reid was elected to Congress as a Republican in 1962. Reid was on the liberal fringe of the GOP and faced repeated challenges in primaries. On March 22, 1972, he switched parties and joined the Democratic Party. Reid said that he could not support Richard Nixon for re-election and the Republican Party had "moved to the right" and was "not showing the compassion and sensitivity to meet the problems of the average American." He turned back a Republican challenge later on in 1972. 

Reid declined to seek re-election in 1974 and he ran for Governor of New York briefly, dropping out of the race before the election.
