In the jutts there are so many sub-casts (according to an English writter 'Densil Abestine', there are more than 150 casts in the jutts in subcontinent) and arguably the Warraichs are superior to all the sub-casts of jutts. They carry a general courtesy, arrogant looks and a debate personality. Usually they are trustworthy, respected, well behaved and traditional people. They are also land lords which is the most sparkling part in their personality. They are strongest as a community in most parts of the Punjab.
