Sketches by Boz

Sketches by "Boz," Illustrative of Every-day Life and Every-day People (usually known as Sketches by Boz) is a collection of short pieces written by Charles Dickens. The book was published in 1836. The first edition was illustrated by George Cruikshank.

The first edition of "Sketches by Boz" was published by John Macrone in two series. The first series was a two-volume set which was published in February 1836. This was just a month before the publication of the first parts of "The Pickwick Papers" (1836-37). The "Second Series" was published in August 1836. After Dickens became famous, he could buy out his agreements with Macrone. Macrone died unexpectedly at 28. Dickens helped to publish a book called "The Pic-Nic Papers" to help Macrone's widow and children.

Most of the fifty-six sketches that appear in the 1839 edition were originally published individually in various newspapers and periodicals. These included "The Morning Chronicle", "The Evening Chronicle", "The Monthly Magazine", "The Carlton Chronicle" and "Bell's Life in London", from 1833 to 1836:
