Luger

The Luger was a German semi-automatic pistol that was introduced in 1908. It was the first pistol to use the 9x19mm Parabellum bullet. Its magazines hold eight bullets.

Technically, it was and is held in high esteem. The workmanship was top-class, and its performance was highly respected. The Luger was eventually replaced by the Walther P38.

The 9 millimeter bullets designed for the gun are still a standard for NATO forces.
