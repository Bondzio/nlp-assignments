Pivot table

A pivot table is a data summary tool. It is found in programs such as spreadsheets or databases. A pivot-table can automatically sort, total or give the average of the data stored in a table. It displays the results in a second table (called a "pivot table"). The pivot table shows the summarized data. Most pivot tables do not automatically update when the spreadsheet or database it is based on changes.
