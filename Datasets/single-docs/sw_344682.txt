Calamosaurus

Calamosaurus was a genus of small theropod dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight.

As a possible basal coelurosaur, "Calamosaurus" would have been a small, agile, bipedal carnivore. Naish "et al" 2001. estimate the living animal would have been around 3–5 meters long (9.8-16.4 feet), with a small head given the build of the neck vertebrae.

There is too little material to say much more about it.
