The Inclosure Act 1773 (13 Geo 3. c. 81) (also known as the Enclosure Act 1773) is an Act of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Act is still in force in the United Kingdom. It created a law that allowed landowners to enclose land and remove the right of commoners to use the land. This act was a big part of the agrarian revolution.
