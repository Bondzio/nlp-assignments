Brenda Ann Spencer

Brenda Ann Spencer (born in San Diego, California on April 3, 1962) is a convicted American murderer who performed a deadly shooting spree, during which she killed two people at the Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego on January 29, 1979. Another nine got hurt during that incident. Spencer showed no remorse in her crime; her full explanation of her actions was "I don't like Mondays; this livens up the day." Those comments were the inspiration to the song "I Don't Like Mondays" by The Boomtown Rats, which reached #1 in the United Kingdom in mid 1979.
