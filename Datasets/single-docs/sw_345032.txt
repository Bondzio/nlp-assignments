Magnetic monopole

A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle in particle physics that is a magnet with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or the other way around). Scientists are interested in this, as they are predicted in several particle theories, such as grand unified and superstring. Magnetism in normal bar magnets and electromagnets does not come from magnetic monopoles. There is not enough evidence to even be sure that magnetic monopoles exist in this universe.
