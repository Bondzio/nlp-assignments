Division of Forde

The Division of Forde is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was set up in 1984, and is named after Frank Forde, Prime Minister of Australia in 1945. At first it covered the southern suburbs of Brisbane, but changes have moved the area of the division into the semi-rural areas south of the city. This includes Beenleigh, Bethania, Boronia Heights, Chambers Flat, Cornubia, Eagleby, Edens Landing, Loganholme, Logan Reserve, Mount Warren Park, Ormeau Hills, Park Ridge, Tanah Merah, Upper Coomera, Waterford, Waterford West and Windaroo as well as parts of Daisy Hill, Heritage Park, Loganlea, Munruben, Ormeau, Park Ridge South and Shailer Park.

On 8 August 2013, it was announced former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie would contest the seat of Forde at the 2013 election.
