Takoyaki

"Takoyaki" is a specialty of Osaka and Kyoto. It is usually eaten as a snack.

Many people in Osaka and Kyoto have a special cooker that makes takoyaki. This is because they eat takoyaki often.

"Takoyaki" was invented in Osaka in 1935 by Tomekichi Endo. It is most often made with flour and small pieces of boiled octopus.

A minor planet named "6562 Takoyaki" was discovered in 1991 by M. Yanai and K. Watanabe at Katani. The name was selected by children who visited the Funai Space Festival which was held in Osaka in 2001.
