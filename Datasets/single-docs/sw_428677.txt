Evolution (professional wrestling)

Evolution is a professional wrestling stable that competes in the WWE. The stable was created on January 20, 2003 and broke up on October 3, 2005.

The members of the stable were Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista and Ric Flair. Triple H acted as the leader and Flair acted as a mentor. The members of the stable each portrayed evolutions of professional wrestling with Ric Flair being "the past", Triple H being "the present" and Randy Orton and Batista being "the future". They all portrayed heels.

On April 14, 2014, Evolution, not including Ric Flair, reunited. They came down to the ring to their theme "Line in the Sand" by Mot√∂rhead and attacked The Shield.

On the June 2 episode of "Raw", Batista quit the WWE after he had his title match request denied by Triple H. Later in the night, Triple H said that he had a "Plan B" in his quest to destroy the Shield, which prompted Rollins to turn on and attack his group members Reigns and Ambrose.
