John Whitney Hall

John Whitney Hall (September 13, 1916 â€“ October 21, 1997), was an American academic, historian, editor and professor at Yale University. 

Hall was born in Kyoto in 1916. He lived in Japan until he was a teenager. According to his wife, "Being brought up in Japan and by missionaries, he was a very straight-arrow kind of person. There is this kind of missionary feeling, that you must make something of this [life], not just throw it away." 

At Amherst College, he was awarded a degree in 1939. He returned to Japan an instructor in English at Doshisha University in Kyoto until 1941. 

Hall earned his Ph.D. in East Asian languages and literatures from Harvard University in 1950. At Harvard, he became one of the first graduate students to study under Edwin O. Reischauer.

In 1948, Hall began teaching at the University of Michigan.

His earliest book was "Tanuma Okitsugu, 1718-1787". Among other interests, his research focused on the Kamakura period in the history of Japan.

He taught at Yale University until he retired in 1983. Yale's John W. Hall Lecture Series in Japanese Studies was established in his memory.
