The Big Bopper

Jiles Perry "J. P." Richardson, Jr. (October 24, 1930 â€“ February 3, 1959) also commonly known as The Big Bopper, was an American disc jockey, singer, and songwriter whose big voice and exuberant personality made him an early rock and roll star. He is best known for his recording of "Chantilly Lace".

The Big Bopper died in the same plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens.
