Time travel

Time travel is the idea of going back in time to the past or forward to the future. Time travel can not be done, so far as we know now. 

Many science fiction and fantasy stories are about time travel. "The Time Machine" (1895) by H. G. Wells was one of the first and most famous. 

Much later, the American movie "Back to the Future" tells a fictional story about a professor who builds a machine that can take people into the future or back in the past. The popular British TV program "Doctor Who" is about an alien who has adventures by time traveling.

Another example of a made-up story about time travel is in the series "Charmed". Instead of using machines and science, they use magic to go to other times and places.
Some series that are not mainly about time travel have episodes about it, including "Star Trek and "Stargate".
