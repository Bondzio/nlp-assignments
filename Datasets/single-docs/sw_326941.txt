Teshio Province

The boundaries of this ancient province are generally mirrored in what is today called Rumoi Subprefecture and the northern half of Kamikawa Subprefecture.

After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaido. Regional subdivisions were established. Teshio Province was one of the new entities which were created in 1869.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Teshio Province were reformed in the 1870s.

In 1882, Teshio and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture.
