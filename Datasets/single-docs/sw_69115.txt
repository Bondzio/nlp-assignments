Self-Strengthening Movement

The Self-Strengthening Movement ( or ; 1861 - 1895) was a reform organised during the late Qing Dynasty. The movement's intent was the modernization of China as a result of many military defeats it had faced at the hands of the West. It could be divided into three phases the first phase (1861 - 1872), the second phase (1872 - 1885) and the third phase (1885 - 1895). 

After the defeat of Opium Wars and the outbreak of Taiping Rebellion, the emperor and the imperial officials realised that the Qing Government would be overthrown soon and they would no longer reign the country. In order to improve the statement, a series of reforms were implemented in the Self-Strengthening Movement.
