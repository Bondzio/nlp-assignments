Mauritanian Association for Human Rights

The Mauritanian Association for Human Rights or "Association Mauritanienne des Droits de l'Homme" (AMDH) (Arabic: للجمعية الموريتانية لحقوق الإنسان ) is a Mauritanian NGO. The organization started in 1991. It works for human rights and watches for human rights violations. Fatimata M’baye is the co-founder and president.

AMDH worked with three main areas of human rights violations: mass killings of black Mauritanian soldiers, deportation of soldiers and members of the press to the desert, and repatriation (sending back refugees) of large groups of Mauritanians from Senegal.
