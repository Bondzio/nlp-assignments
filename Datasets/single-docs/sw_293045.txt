Arboreal

Arboreal: an adjective in biology for an animal which lives in the trees. 

All forests have had animals living in them. Those animals have adaptations which enable them to live and move about in trees. The earliest one known is "Suminia", a synapsid of the late Permian, about 260 million years ago.
