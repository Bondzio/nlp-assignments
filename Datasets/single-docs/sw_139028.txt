Civil Police (Brazil)

In Brazil, the Civil Police (called the <nowiki>"Polícía Civil"</nowiki> in Portuguese) is the country's investigative state police forces. The Civil Police are under the authority of the federative units of Brazil. The federative units' job is to protect public safety and keep public order. Article 144 of the gives this job to the federative units (and their agency, the Civil Police).

Each of the states of Brazil has its own "Civil Police Department", which carries out detective work, forensics and criminal investigation. Each Civil Police Department acts as a state bureau of investigation.

The Civil Police of Brazil began as the General Intendancy of Police, created in Rio de Janeiro on 10 May 1808. The General Intendancy was later re-organized and renamed the Civil Police. Today, the Constitution of Brazil says that the Civil Police must exist. This is stated in article 144, IV and 144 § 4°, of the Federal Constitution.

There are 27 civil police forces in Brazil, one for each state. They are directed by a Head of Police, who is elected.
