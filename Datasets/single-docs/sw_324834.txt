Military taxonomy

Military taxonomy is an indexing tool or record-keeping template. It includes weapons, equipment, organizations, strategies, and tactics. 

Military taxonomy can be used to analyze field missions and other activities. For example, a taxonomy of terrorism would include terms related to terrorists, terrorist groups, terrorist attacks, weapons, venues, and characteristics of terrorists and terrorist groups.

A taxonomy of terms that describes types of military actions is affected by how all elements are defined and used. Many military strategies can be analyzed using a taxonomy model.
