Vanderbilt University is a private university in Nashville, Tennessee. The university has about 12,714 students. It was founded in 1873. The current chairman of the university, whose official title is "Chancellor", is Nicholas Zeppos. It is named after Cornelius Vanderbilt.

The athletics teams of the university are called the Commodores. They have 16 varsity teams, almost all of which compete in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

The lacrosse team plays in the Big East Conference.
