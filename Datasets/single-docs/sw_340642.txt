Saltaire

Saltaire is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. The site is a complete and well-preserved industrial village of the second half of the 19th century. It has textile mills, public buildings and workers' housing.

Construction of Saltaire was started in 1851 by Sir Titus Salt. The name of the village is a combination of the founder's last name and the name of the Aire River which runs through it.

Salt owned several textile mills Yorkshire. In 1853, he moved his businesses and his workers to Saltaire.

In time, the new village grew to over 800 dwellings.

In 1933, the village was sold the Bradford Property Trust. The mill closed down in 1986.

In 2001, Saltaire was named a World Heritage Site.
