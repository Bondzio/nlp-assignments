Pleurisy

Pleurisy (also known as pleuritis) is an inflammation of the pleura, the lining surrounding the lungs. There are many possible causes of pleurisy but viral infections spreading from the lungs to pleural cavity are the most common. Pleurisy can cause sharp pain when breathing, also called pleuritic chest pain.
