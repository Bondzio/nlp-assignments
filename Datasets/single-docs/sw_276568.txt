Tridentine Mass

Tridentine Mass is the name given to a Roman Rite Catholic mass, as it was common before 1969. The Missale romanum of 1570 first specified how this mass should be celebrated. The missal was revised several times, the last revision dates of 1962. The celebration is done almost exclusively in Latin. Since 2007, it is permitted as an alternative to the form introduced by the Second Vatican Council. There is also a translation into Church Slavonic which uses that language instead of Latin. The Slavoic form is in use mainly in the Balkans.
