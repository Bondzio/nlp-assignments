Antimony pentafluoride

Antimony pentafluoride, also known as antimony(V) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbF. It has five antimony-fluorine bonds. The antimony is in its +5 oxidation state.

Antimony pentafluoride is a colorless thick liquid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and very reactive. It can help fluorine to oxidize oxygen. This is not normal as oxygen normally oxidizes other things; it does not get oxidized. It can make very strong acids when mixed with hydrofluoric acid. It was used in the first reaction that used fluorides to make fluorine.

It is made by reacting antimony pentoxide or antimony pentachloride with hydrofluoric acid. It can also be made by reacting antimony trifluoride with fluorine. 

It is used to make very strong acids.

Antimony pentafluoride reacts with most chemical compounds. It is extremely corrosive.
