Great Western Railway (train company)

Great Western Railway, formerly known as First Great Western is a British train operating company owned by FirstGroup, which has services in the west and south west of England and South Wales. It also runs the "Night Riviera" overnight train between London and Penzance.

Near the end of January 2010, First Great Western said that an Â£8,000,000 refresh programme to their fleet of Class 166 Turbo DMU trains would happen.

The company began operating on 4 February 1996 as Great Western Trains, as part of the privatisation of British Rail, and in December 1998 became First Great Western after FirstGroup bought the company. On 1 April 2006, First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains were combined into First Great Western. On 20 September 2015, FirstGroup started to operate an extended franchise that is due to run until 30 March 2019. With the new franchise, the company rebranded as Great Western Railway and introduced a new livery.
