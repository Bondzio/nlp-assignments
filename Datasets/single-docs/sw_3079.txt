Newcastle United F.C.

Newcastle United Football Club is an English football club in Newcastle upon Tyne. Newcastle play in the Premier League. In the 2008/09 season they were relegated after 16 years in the top flight, but won promotion back into the Premier League by winning the Football League Championship. In the 2015/16 season the were relegated again.
Newcastle United was formed in 1892 after the two rival clubs Newcastle West End and Newcastle East End grouped together. They have played their matches at the ground St.James' Park ever since. This ground holds 52,000 people, and is one of the biggest in England. It is located just outside the centre of Newcastle.

Newcastle originally played in red and white stripes. They changed to the familiar black and white stripes in 1904 so that they would not be confused with Sunderland - Sunderland are Newcastle's local rivals. 

On the 24th of May 2009, Newcastle were relegated on the last day of the season to the second tier of English football, the Coca Cola Championship. They rapidly returned to the top flight of English football, winning the Championship in the 2009/10 season. In the 2010/11 season they finished mid-table. The club then went on to finish 5th place in the 2011/12 season.

Traditionally the loudest support for the club came from the Gallowgate End - a stand in St. James' Park. This stand is where Alan Shearer once used to watch Newcastle play when he was a child. 

The record transfer fee the club has paid is £17 million (around $30 million) for Michael Owen, in August 2005. Alan Shearer was the previous record transfer at £15 million, which was also the world's largest transfer fee when he signed in 1996.

The Newcastle United's number 9 shirt is one of the most famous shirts in the world. Legends such as Hughie Gallacher, Malcolm McDonald, Jackie Milburn and Alan Shearer have worn the famous shirt.
