Hair tie

A hair tie is an accessory used to hold back long hair, particularly away from areas such as the face. This is usually done as part of a hairstyle.

Hair ties' elasticity and durability varies according to the material or materials from which they are made. Most hair ties are made of elastic, rubber, or stretchy cotton.
