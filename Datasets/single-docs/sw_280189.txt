Juggling

Juggling is a skill where a person (the "juggler") keeps objects ("props") moving for a long time, using their hands or other parts of their body. The most common props are balls (or beanbags), clubs and rings. Some jugglers use more dangerous-looking objects such as knives, fire torches and chainsaws. There are other kinds of juggling prop such as diabolos, yo-yos, poi, devil sticks, cigar boxes, foot bags and hats.

Juggling can be for entertainment, art or sport.
