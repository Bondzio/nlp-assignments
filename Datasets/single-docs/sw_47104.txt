Yorkshire

Yorkshire is a historic county in Northern England. It covers a large area of the Pennines and its east coast borders the North Sea. The River Humber separates Yorkshire from Lincolnshire and the River Ouse flows into it. 

The main towns and cities in Yorkshire are Leeds, York, Sheffield, Bradford, Middlesbrough, and Hull. It is the largest county in the United Kingdom. It covers just under with a population of around 5 million.

Yorkshire was historically split up into three parts known as the East, North, and West Ridings while the county town York was in the middle. In the local government reorganization of England in 1974 the counties of West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire were established instead. Humberside included the former East Riding and Cleveland included part of the former North Riding. 

The people of Yorkshire are traditional rivals of the people of Lancashire; they sometimes call Yorkshire the "County of Broad Acres" (because its land area is so large) or "God's Own County".
