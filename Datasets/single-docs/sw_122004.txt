Birote Kalan is one of the 51 Union councils of Abbottabad District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

The words Khurd and Kalan (little and big) are words that started being used in Mughal times - to tell the difference between two areas with the same name, so Birote Khurd means little Khurd, The words Khurd (small) and Kalan (big) is Taken form Persian. (Just like Britannia major means "Greater Britain" and Britannia minor means "Lesser Britain").
