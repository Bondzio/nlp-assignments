In the 1st century AD, Romans won the area of Banja Luka, which was then inhabited mainly members of Mezeji, a Illyrian teribe.

Today's citadel Kastel in the city center at that time was used as a Roman military fortress.

Slavs settled Balkans and all of the current Banja Luka in the sixth and 7th century in, and this time, of which there are generally very few written records, was built several fortresses in the valley of the river Vrbas. The earliest Slavic settlement called also ‘’Vrbas’’, which was first mentioned in 1320 and Banja Luka as a town under the name first mentioned in 1494, by Croatian-Hungarian King Vladislav. The very name comes from "banjaluk" that is the Turkish-Bosnian sleng means "spaing". This is in association with hot water for baths that still exist in today's oldest settlement Gornji Šeher/Upper Seher.
