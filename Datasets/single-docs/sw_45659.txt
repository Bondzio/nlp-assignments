Almond

The almond, Prunus dulcis, is a small tree in the family Rosaceae. "Almond" is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated 'nut' of this tree. 

The fruit of the almond has an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed or nut inside. Shelling almonds means removing the shell to get the seed. Almonds are sold either shelled or unshelled. 

The almond is a small tree. It grows from four and 10 meters tall. It has a trunk 30 centimetres wide. The young twigs are green at first. When they are in their second year, they turn gray. The leaves are three to five inches long. The flowers are white or light pink, 3–5 cm wide with five petals.
