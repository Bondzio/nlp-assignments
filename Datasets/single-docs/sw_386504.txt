Multivitamin

A multivitamin is set of vitamins used often with minerals needed by the human body to function properly. Multivitamins are available as tablets, capsules, pastilles, powders, liquids, and injections. Besides injections, multivitamins are recognized by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the United Nations' authority on food standards) as a category of food.

Multivitamins are often provided with minerals. A multivitamin/mineral set is approved in the United States as a (supplement) addition to diet containing 3 or more vitamins and minerals that does not include herbs, hormones, or drugs. The terms multivitamin and multimineral are often used interchangeably. There is no scientific definition for either.

There is scientific evidence that for healthy people, multivitamin do not provide protection from cancer, heart disease or other serious diseases. But for people with very specific health and economical situation (for example poor people that cant afford meat and fruits or people living in poor areas).
