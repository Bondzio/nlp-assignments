Slut

Slut is a broad word used to describe women (or sometimes men) who often have casual sex, without depending on their age, race, class or ethnic background. The word is often considered to be offensive. It probably comes from the old German word Schlutt "slovenly woman". It could also come from Swedish slata "idle woman, slut". It may have come from Dutch slodder "slut". However, it is not known where it came from for sure. Chaucer uses the word "sluttish" (late 14c.) to describe a dirty man. However, it is most often used today to describe women, not men. Also, hard pieces in bread because it was not well kneaded were called "slut's pennies".
