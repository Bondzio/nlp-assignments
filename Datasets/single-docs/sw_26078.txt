Mother 1 + 2

Mother 1 + 2 is a video game for the Game Boy Advance which includes "Mother" and "Mother 2" ("EarthBound" US). Much of the music is different than the console games ("Mother 2" is mostly the same, but "Mother" was changed a lot to make it similar to the United States one that was not sold).
