Ununoctium

Ununoctium (eka-radon or element 118) is the temporary IUPAC for the transactinide element oganesson (atomic number 118) and temporary element symbol Uuo. An ununoctium atom is very unstable, meaning it quickly changes to another atom (nuclear reaction). Only three atoms of ununoctium have been produced since 2002. Although it is a noble gas, it is probably more reactive than other noble gases. It is so heavy, it might be a liquid or a solid at room temperature. No practical uses of ununoctium are known, other than for scientific research in labs.

-Ununoctium is element 118, meaning that it is the last element in the general periodic table, and the heaviest element known to have ever been produced (May 2015).
