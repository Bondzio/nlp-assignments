West Coast Conference

The West Coast Conference (WCC) is a college sports conference in the western United States that sponsors many sports, but has never sponsored football. Only two of its current members have football teams.

The WCC began in 1952 when five schools in and around the San Francisco Bay Area formed the California Basketball Association. The league was then called the West Coast Athletic Conference from 1956 to 1989.

All 10 of its current members were founded by churches; seven are Catholic schools. Only Pacific, which was founded by Methodists, no longer receives money from a church.

The WCC has 10 members. All are located in West Coast states except BYU.

The WCC has one "associate member" that plays one sport in the conference.
