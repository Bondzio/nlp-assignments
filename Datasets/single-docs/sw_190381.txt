Alice in Wonderland (1951 movie)

Alice in Wonderland is a 1951 American animated movie produced by Walt Disney and based on the 1865 story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. It is the thirteenth Disney animated classic and includes the voices of Kathryn Beaumont (who also voiced Wendy Darling in the 1953 Disney movie "Peter Pan") as Alice, and Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter.

A little girl named Alice is bored from her history lesson given by her sister. She, along with her kitten, Dinah, sneaks away and dream a world full of nonsense. However, Alice sees an unusual White Rabbit, who was holding large golden pocket watch and running off in a hurry. Curious to know where the Rabbit is going, Alice decides to follow him down the rabbit hole, where her adventures in Wonderland begin. Changing sizes from big to small, meeting bizarre people, like the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Caterpillar, Alice is tired from her adventures in Wonderland and wishes to go home.
