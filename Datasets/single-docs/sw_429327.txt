WWE Day of Reckoning 2

WWE Day of Reckoning 2 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and published by THQ.

It was released on August 29, 2005 in North America, September 23, 2005 in Europe, October 7, 2005 in Australasia.

IGN rated the game a 8.5 out of 10 saying "The control mechanics, already solidly grapple-heavy and speedy, are made more intuitive still by a strategic synergy between stamina and submission systems, and complemented again by a fun momentum shift. The result is a wrestling game with less button mashing and more strategy."

GameSpot gave the game a 8.1 out of 10 and stated "Though some may be disappointed by the fact that it isn't a huge leap past what Day of Reckoning put forth, fans of the first game are certain to have a great time with the sequel."
