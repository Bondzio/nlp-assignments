Republican Party presidential primaries, 1984

The 1984 Republican presidential primaries were the selection process by which voters of the Republican Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 1984 U.S. presidential election. 

Current President Ronald Reagan was again selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses which happened in the 1984 Republican National Convention. It was held from August 20 to August 23, 1984 in Dallas, Texas.

The primaries were uneventful as Reagan was bound to win the nomination because of his popularity within the party.
