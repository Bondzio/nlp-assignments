Andrew McCabe

Andrew George McCabe (born May 5, 1968) is an American attorney. He is the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation since February 1, 2016.

On May 9, 2017, McCabe became Acting Director after Comey was fired from duties as Director by U.S. President Donald Trump. President Trump sent a letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, referring to a recommendation to remove Comey from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. 

In the absence of a Senate-confirmed Director, the Deputy Director automatically becomes Acting Director.

McCabe became Deputy Director again after Christopher A. Wray was sworn-in as the new FBI Director on August 2, 2017.
