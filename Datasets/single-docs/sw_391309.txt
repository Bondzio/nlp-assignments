Alternative fuel vehicle

Alternative fuel vehicles are vehicles that use energy that comes from something other than petroleum (oil). (Gasoline and diesel fuel come from petroleum). Most of the alternative energy does not need to be imported from other countries, so money stays in the country. Some (but not all) come from renewable sources. Many produce less pollution than gasoline or diesel. 

Alternative fuel vehicles cover a wide range of engines and motors.

Also, there are bicycles, rickshaws, and two and three-wheeled human powered vehicles.
