Groupement des écoles d'aéronautique

The Groupement des écoles d'aéronautique (GEA France) (in English French aviation school network) includes three French engineering universities:


The GEA is member of the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research.

The GEA universities have created the "Institut sino-européen d'ingénierie de l'aviation" of Tianjin in partnership with French aerospace companies. This is part of Franco-Chinese cooperation after an Airbus A320 assembly plant was built in Tianjin.

The university, opened in October 2007, trains Chinese students. They follow a course in aerospace engineering, taught in French. After a first year of learning the French language, they follow a master's degree course in aeronautical engineering.

Not linked with the engineering training, three "Mastères Spécialisés" are also taught in Tianjin:
