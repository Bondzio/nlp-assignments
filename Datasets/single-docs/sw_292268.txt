Parable of Drawing in the Net

The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 13:47â€“52. It is a parable about the final judgment. It is the seventh and last parable in the chapter which began with the Parable of the Sower.

The parable:
It is, like The Tares and the Wheat and The Sheep and the Goats, a parable about the final judgment. Here, the edible fish must be separated from the inedible fish after they caught with a net. 

Four of his disciples were fishermen and Jesus spoke using imagery they understood. Because it is a parable about the end of the age, a modern interpretation can be considered, with the net representing the Internet. Jesus's next words about old and new treasures indicated he did have in mind a future time. At that time, "true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdom's treasure for all to see."
