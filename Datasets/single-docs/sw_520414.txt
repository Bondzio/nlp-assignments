1980 New Orleans Saints season

The 1980 New Orleans Saints season was the team's 14th season in the National Football League. 

They were the first NFL team to finish a season with 1 win and 15 losses. Their only win was against the New York Jets in week 15. They had trailed 7-13 but Archie Manning threw a touchdown to Tony Galbreath to lead 14-13 and would throw another one to win 21-20.

Fans called their team "the Aints" because of how they began with no wins and 12 losses by losing to the Rams 7-27. 

One of the Saints' notable losses was in week 14 at San Francisco, California. The Saints were actually leading 35-7. However, the San Francisco 49ers ended up beating it in overtime 38-35 on a game winning field goal. The comeback is one of the best comebacks in NFL history. 

8 other teams have finished a season with 1 win and 15 losses after the 1980 Saints. These teams include the 1989 Cowboys, 1990 Patriots, 1991 Colts, 1996 Jets, 2000 Chargers, 2001 Panthers, 2007 Dolphins, and the 2009 Rams. The Detroit Lions in 2008 would exceed it by losing all 16 games.
