Single person

A person is called single if he or she is not married. In a more general sense, the word also means that person currently has no exclusive partner, like a boyfriend or girlfriend. Such people can be classified into different types:

In English, male singles used to be called "bachelors", female singles used to be called "spinsters" (or "bachelorettes", more recently). In general, the word "single" is used more often now, because it also does not make a difference between the two sexes.
