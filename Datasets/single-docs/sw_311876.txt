Pokémon Mystery Dungeon

Pokémon Mystery Dungeon is a "Pokémon" game where you form a rescue team ("Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Blue" and "Red Rescue Team") or an exploration team ("Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Darkness", "Time and Sky"). In the game, the main star is you, and before you start playing, you have to answer a quiz to determine what Pokémon you turn into.
