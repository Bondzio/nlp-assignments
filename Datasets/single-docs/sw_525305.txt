Training corset

A training corset is a corset used for doing body modification (changing the body). It may be used for orthopedic reasons (such as to correct a crooked spine) or for cosmetic reasons (to achieve a smaller waistline which is commonly called waist training).

The term "training corset" is also sometimes used for BDSM corsets used for discipline.
