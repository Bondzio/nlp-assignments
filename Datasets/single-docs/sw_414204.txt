Erysimum caboverdeanum

Erysimum caboverdeanum is a plant species that belongs to the Brassicaceae family, the cabbage or mustard family. It is found only in the Fogo island, Cape Verde.

It was named for the first time by the French botanist Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier in 1935. "Caboverdeanum" (or the original "caboverdeana") is a Latin word that means "Cape Verdean" or "from Cape Verde".

Chevalier named, in 1935, this species as "Matthiola caboverdeana"; this name now is a synonym because Sunding changed it to the present name, "Erysimum caboverdeanum".

It is locally known as "crabo bravo" ("wild carnation") and "alecrim branco" ("white rosemary").
