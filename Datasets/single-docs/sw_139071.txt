Puss Gets the Boot

"Puss Gets the Boot" is a cartoon which was released on February 10, 1940. As the first "Tom and Jerry" cartoon, it started the "Tom and Jerry" series, which had more than 160 cartoons that were released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1940-2005. "Puss Gets the Boot" was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to a different cartoon called "The Milky Way".

William Hanna and Joseph Barbera directed, illustrated and animated the cartoon. It was nine minutes long and was meant to be the only cartoon with Tom and Jerry in it. Because it was popular with large audiences, Hanna and Barbera were asked to make more cartoons with the famous cat and mouse pair.

In this cartoon, Tom was named Jasper and Jerry was named Jinx. The cartoon is about Jasper who chases Jinx around the house and breaks things. Mammy Two Shoes, who is Jasper's owner, says he will stay outside if he breaks one more thing. Jinx tries to make Jasper break more things so he will have to be forced outside. After "Puss Gets the Boot", the characters were given the names they have today: Tom and Jerry.
