Bungo Province

Bungo had borders with Buzen, Hyūga, Higo, Chikugo, and Chikuzen Provinces. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Bungo Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Sasamuta-jinja" and "Yusuhara Hachiman-gū" were the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") of Bungo.
