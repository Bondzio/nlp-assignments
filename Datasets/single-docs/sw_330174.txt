Little Women, or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is a book by Louisa May Alcott. Alcott drew on her own childhood experiences with her three sisters when writing the book. They lived in Concord, Massachusetts at Orchard House.

They were first published as one volume in 1880. The novel was followed by two sequels: "Little Men" and "Jo's Boys". The novel has been adapted to movies several times. Katherine Hepburn and June Allyson have both played Jo in the movies.

The story is about the fictional March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They call their mother Marmee. The story is set during the American Civil War. Their father is serving as a chaplain in the Union Army. Each sister has a flaw. Amy is selfish, Beth is shy, Meg is vain, and Jo is outspoken and tomboy-ish. Their best friend is Laurie, the boy next door.
