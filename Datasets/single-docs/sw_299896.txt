James Chambers (pastoralist)

James Chambers (1811–1862) was an English man who became a rich pastoralist (farmer) in South Australia. He is well known for funding the exploring costs of John McDouall Stuart from 1850—1862. Many Australian geographic features have been named after him including the strange rock formation, Chambers Pillar, and Chambers Bay.
