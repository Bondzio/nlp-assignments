Political parties in the United States

In the United States, there have usually been two main political parties. Since the 1860s, these two main parties have been the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Republican Party has the most seats in the House of Representatives as well as a majority in the senate. 

The three largest parties aside from the two main political parties are the Libertarian Party (United States), Green Party of the United States, and the Constitution Party in respective order.

Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and the most recent past President Barack Obama are Democrats. They have 48 out of 100 seats in the U.S. Senate and 194 out of 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Sixteen out of 50 state governors are also Democrats. The party generally promotes liberalism and is often classed as a centre-left party. Currently, the party has 72 million registered voters across America.

Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump. Republican Paul Ryan became the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives on October 29, 2015.
