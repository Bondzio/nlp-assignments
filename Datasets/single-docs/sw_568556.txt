Les Demoiselles d'Avignon

Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) was a 1907 cubist painting by Picasso. It represents five women in a brothel. It took him nine months to paint it. Picasso gave up all attempts at traditional painting in this early cubist painting. He distorted the female figures in a way that showed the influence of African art. When the painting was shown in his studio to a group of painters and critics, they were outraged. Henri Matisse called it a hoax and an attempt to paint the fourth dimension, The art critic André Salmon wrote: "It was the ugliness of the faces that froze with horror the half-converted." Another painter, André Derain, wrote: "One day we shall find Pablo has hanged himself behind his great canvas." It has been called one of the most significant paintings of the 20th century. It is a original work. But it has never been fully accepted by the art world.
