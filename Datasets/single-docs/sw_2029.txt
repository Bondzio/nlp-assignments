Plural

The plural of a noun shows the number of that noun is more than one.

The singular form of a noun shows the quantity of that noun is one. 

In many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In the English language, the suffix "-s" is used to indicate that a noun has been turned into its plural form (inflection). Here is an example: "cat" is a singular noun, but "cats" is a plural noun. 

There are a number of exceptions: 

It is fair to say that most native English speakers do make mistakes in this area: it is one of the more troublesome aspects of the English language.

All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each one of these other languages is different from the suffix that is applied to English nouns.

In such East Asian languages as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is no plural ending. Native speakers of these languages usually fail to inflex English nouns into their plural forms.
