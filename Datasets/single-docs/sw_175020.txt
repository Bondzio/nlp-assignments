Predestination (Calvinism)

Predestination is a central belief in Calvinism. Calvinists believe that God picked those who he will save and bring with him to heaven before the world was created. They also believe that people who are not saved by God will go to hell. John Calvin thought people who were saved could never lose their salvation and the "elected" (those God saved) would know they were saved because of their actions.
