Glazed tile

A glazed tile is a form of art. It is when you take a tile, put chemical glazes on it and let it dry and put it into a kiln (an oven that heats up to high temperatures). The kiln heats to about 2000 degrees turning the chemical glaze to colors. It is often framed and sold. This is a popular form of art.

Glazed tiles were used to make the roof on buildings in China.
