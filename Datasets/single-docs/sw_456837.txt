Elsa (Disney)

Elsa is the Queen of Arendelle in the Disney movie "Frozen". For most of the movie, she is voiced by singer and actress Idina Menzel. However, "Young Elsa" is voiced by Eva Bella, and "Teen Elsa" is voiced by Spencer Lacey Ganus. Elsa has a sister named Anna who is younger than her.

Elsa was born with magic powers. She freezes everything that she touches. When she can't control them, she shuts herself away from everyone.

This is what the Official Frozen Website says about Elsa:
"From the outside, Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret."

Elsa is based on the main character of the story The Snow Queen. In the movie, Elsa is born with ice powers and hurts her sister Anna, causing her parents to lock her up in her room for her young life. Elsa's parents die, and Elsa becomes the queen, but escapes to finally have freedom for herself and avoid hurting people with her ice powers. When Elsa accidentally freezes the kingdom, she flees to a far-off mountain. Anna goes after her sister.

Elsa was the hardest character Disney had ever made. For example, a normal person has 100,000 hairs on his head, but Elsa has 420,000 hairs on her head.

Elsa's song "Let It Go" received many positive reviews from viewers and critics.
