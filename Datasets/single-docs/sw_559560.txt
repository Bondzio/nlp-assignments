Metropolitan Division

The National Hockey League's Metropolitan Division was formed in 2013 as part of the Eastern Conference in a league realignment. It followed the Atlantic Division which and some teams also joined from the Southeast Division. Six of its teams had been in the Patrick Division from 1981–93 (one joined in 1982). As of the 2013–14 season, it is the only NHL division without a Canadian team. Five of the division's teams are located in either the New York City area or in Pennsylvania.
