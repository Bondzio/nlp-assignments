Log Cabin Republicans

Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) is an organization in the United States. They do work within the Republican Party. They work for equal rights for LGBT people in the United States. 

On February 15, 2013, the National Board of Directors made Gregory T. Angelo the director.

Log Cabin Republicans began in 1977 in California as a cause for Republicans who were against the Briggs Initiative. The Briggs Initiative would have banned homosexuals from teaching in public schools. It called for the firing of openly gay or lesbian teachers.

Ronald Reagan, who was running for President, was against the Briggs Initiative.

LCR was against the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004 because of his support of the Federal Marriage Amendment.

LCR acts differently from socially conservative Republicans' views or is neutral. They work for same-sex marriage, domestic partner benefits and permanent removal of the estate tax.

The LCR has no official position on abortion.
