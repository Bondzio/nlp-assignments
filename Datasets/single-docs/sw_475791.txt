Silly Symphony

Silly Symphony is a series of 75 animated short films (shorts). They were produced by Walt Disney Productions from 1929 to 1939. 

After the movies changed to sound, Walt Disney began making Mickey Mouse and musical "Silly Symphony" shorts. To keep costs down Disney produced his own music. Disney's first music director and composer was Carl Stalling. The Mickey Mouse shorts used pop music while the Silly Symphony shorts used Classical music. In 1932 the studio produced its first cartoon in Technicolor, "Flowers and Trees". The success of the song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?, from the Silly Symphony short "Three Little Pigs" (1933), convinced Disney to keep producing original music. It was at this time Disney introduced the characters of Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Minnie Mouse. Throughout the 1930s Silly Symphonies won every Academy Award presented to animation shorts.

The series also spawned a Disney media franchise which included the newspaper comic strip "Silly Symphony", the Dell comic book series "Silly Symphonies", as well as several children's books, many of which were based on "Silly Symphony" cartoons.
