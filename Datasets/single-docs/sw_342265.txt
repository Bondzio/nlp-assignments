Bourbon Restoration

The Bourbon Restoration was the return of the House of Bourbon to France after the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte. It began in 1814 after Napoleon was defeated and exiled to Elba island off the coast of Italy. Louis XVIII of France, the younger brother of Louis XVI of France, was named king in 1814 by the Congress of Vienna.

After being removed by Napoleon during the Hundred Days, Louis XVIII was returned to power in 1815 and died in 1824. Louis XVIII was succeeded by his younger brother Charles X of France who ruled until he was removed in 1830 by the July Revolution.
