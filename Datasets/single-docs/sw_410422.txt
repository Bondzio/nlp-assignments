Search and rescue

Search and rescue is when people look for a person who is lost or in danger. It is usually carried by ships, helicopters, or land vehicles that are specially equipped. Most of these missions take place at sea or in the mountains. Search and rescue missions are performed by civilian and military rescuers, or firemen.

Combat search and rescue is a military variant performed by special forces on the battlefield.
