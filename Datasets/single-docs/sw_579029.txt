Clinton Family Portrait

Clinton Family Portrait is an oil painting by American artist Larry D. Alexander. Alexander, who is from the state of Arkansas, painted this portrait in 1995 and gave it as a gift to then U.S. President Bill Clinton who is also from Arkansas. It is now a part of the permanent collection at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas.The painting was inspired from a childhood memory of a talk Alexander once had with some childhood friends about doing a painting of the first president to be elected from Arkansas, something that they didnâ€™t think would happen any time soon.It was painted in Irving, Texas in early 1995 and was shipped to the White House early in that same year.
