New Zealand at the Olympics

New Zealand at the Olympics is a history which began in 1908. 

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for New Zealand is NZL.

A team from New Zealand was first at the Olympic Games in 1908. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then. For their first two Games in 1908 and 1912, New Zealand was with Australia in a combined "Australasia" team. New Zealand first sent an independent team in 1920.

New Zealand has been in most Winter Olympic Games since 1952, missing only the 1956 and 1964 Games.

New Zealand athletes have won a total of 103 medals at the Summer Games. The most successful sport is athletics. New Zealand has only won a single medal at the Winter Games. The silver medal won by Annelise Coberger in alpine skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics was the first medal won at the Winter Games by a Southern Hemisphere nation.

The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) is the National Olympic Committee for New Zealand. The NZOC was formed in 1911, and recognized by the IOC in 1919.

Being in the remote South Pacific, New Zealanders had to take long sea voyages to attend the early Olympics. It wasnâ€™t until 1920 that New Zealand sent its first team. Before that three New Zealanders won medals for Australasian teams in 1908 and 1912. 

As of 1111 athletes have represented New Zealand at the Olympic Games. 

The total (NZ) does not include the medals won by New Zealanders as part of the combined Australasia team (ANZ) at the 1908 Summer Olympics and 1912 Summer Olympics:
