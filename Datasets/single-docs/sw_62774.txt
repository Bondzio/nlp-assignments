Norwegian Dawn

The Norwegian Dawn is a cruise ship that began sailing in 2002 and is currently in operation with Norwegian Cruise Line.

The "Norwegian Dawn" was ordered from shipbuilders Meyer-Werft, Papenburg, Germany. It was delivered in 2001 to Star Cruises. But, it was decided by Star Cruises that "SuperStar Libra" and "SuperStar Scorpio" would start being used as part of the fleet operated by subsidiary company Norwegian Cruise Line. These vessels would become "Norwegian Star" and "Norwegian Dawn". In 2002, "Norwegian Dawn" was delivered to NCL. It is the second SuperStar.

The "Norwegian Dawn" sails from New York City to Port Canaveral, Florida; Miami, Florida; Nassau, Bahamas; and Great Stirrup Cay.
