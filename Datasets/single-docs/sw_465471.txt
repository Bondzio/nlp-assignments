2014 Ebola virus cases in the United States

On September 30, 2014, the first case of Ebola virus disease was diagnosed in the United States. It came from a 42-year-old Liberian national, Thomas Eric Duncan. Even before Duncan's diagnosis, three Americans had been medically evacuated from Africa and treated in the United States for Ebola virus disease. This was during the current Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Two were treated at Emory University Hospital's isolation unit and one at Nebraska Medical Center. 

Duncan, who came from Liberia, had been visiting family in Dallas, Texas. He was treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. By October 4, his condition had deteriorated from "serious but stable" to "critical". On October 4, Duncan started receiving the experimental drug brincidofovir, but remained in critical condition. On October 8, Duncan died of Ebola virus disease.
