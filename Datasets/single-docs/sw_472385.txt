Hatsumoude

Hatsumoude is the first visit of the new year to a shrine or temple. Many Japanese people visit a shrine or temple. They pray to gods or Buddha for the health and happiness of their family in the coming year. A Hatsumoude is usually performed between January 1st and 7th, which is based on ancient beliefs.

You should clean your body before you pray. "Chozuya" is cleaning your body.
(You can't draw water into a ladle twice, so you must finish all the cleaning with one ladle of water.)


Originally, hatsumoude had been called "toshigomori". It was a custom that the head of family stay in the shrine from night on New Year Eve to morning on New Year's Day for prayer. In Meiji period, toshigomori had divided into "jyoyamoude" that was done at night on New Year's Eve. Also "ganjitsumoude" that was done in morning on New Year's Day. So "ganjitsumoude" is the original form of today's hatsumoude.
