EADS Harfang

The EADS Harfang is a European and Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle developed for service in the French Air Force. Built by EADS, its name comes from a bird, the "snowy owl".

The Harfang is a twin-boom aircraft, propelled by a rear-mounted engine. Avionics include GPS. It has no weapon on board.


In May 2011, it was used for observation of the G8 meeting in Deauville. 
In January 2013, France used this plane for reconnaissance against Islamist terrorists who occupy the north of Mali.
