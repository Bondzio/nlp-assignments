Cumberland Gap

The Cumberland Gap is a narrow pass through the Cumberland Mountains. It is apart of the Appalachian Mountains. It is near the junction of the U.S. states of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. First used by Native Americans, it was famous during American colonial history as a key passage through the lower Appalachians. In 1775 the trail was blazed by Daniel Boone. Over the next 35 years, over 300,000 Settlers used it to get to the western frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee. It was an important part of the Wilderness Road. It is now part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.
