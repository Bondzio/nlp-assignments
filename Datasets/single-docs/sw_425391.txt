Philip the Arab

Philip the Arab (; , ""; 204 â€“ 249) was the ruler of the Roman Empire from 244 to 249 AD.

He is known as Philip "the Arab" for two reasons. He came from modern-day Syria, then the Roman province of "Arabia Petraea" and is descended from an Arabian tribe that migrated to Syria from what is today Yemen. 

He was one of the Roman rulers that ended war with the empire known as the Sassanids, a dynasty of Persians.

He became emperor after Gordian III. During his reign, Rome celebrated its millennium or its 1,000th anniversary of existence.

Many say that unlike the Pagan rulers of the Romans, Philip was nice to the Christians and let them practice their faith openly. Philip and his wife received letters from Origen.

Philip was overthrown and killed following a rebellion led by his successor Decius.
