Mouse deer

Chevrotains, also known as mouse deer, are small even-toed ungulates that make up the family Tragulidae

Mouse deer live in Asia. They are about the size of a hare, with short, thin legs. They stamp their small feet to signal to each other. Mouse deer are extremely nervous. When they are surprised, they freeze immediately, and then run away in a zig-zag through the forest.
