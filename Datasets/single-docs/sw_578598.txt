Narcissus (mythology)

In classical mythology, Narcissus was a beautiful hunter from Boetia. The most popular myth about him features him falling in love with his own reflection in a pool of water, which he stared at until he died. His name is the origin of the term narcissism, which means a fixation a person has with their own appearance.
