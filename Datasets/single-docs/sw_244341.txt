Squat

Squat is a renowned element of many folk dances. 
In powerlifting and bodybuilding, as well as in other sports, squat is an exercise that strengthens the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, as well as the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body.

Although the squat is a basic element of weight training, it has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years. Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees. As a result, many trainers suggest that the standard barbell squat be modified in various ways. Others, however, reject all suggestions that the exercise be abandoned, continuing to advocate the squat.
