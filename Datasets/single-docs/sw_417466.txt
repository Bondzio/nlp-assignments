Peasants' Revolt

The Peasants' Revolt was a rebellion of peasants in England, in 1381. It was the biggest rebellion of farmers in medieval England. The causes of the rebellion are unclear today, but there are different candidates:
Other names for the rebellion are Wat Tyler's Rebellion, after Wat Tyler who was a local leader of the peasants in the rebellion. Yet another name is Great Rising.

There were two types of peasants; serfs, and free peasants. The serfs, especially, had many difficulties. The serfs were farmers. These peasants had barely anything to live on, and did not get paid very well. The free peasants had less than all of the other social classes, except for the serfs. The free peasants had to pay rent to live "free", and also had to pay for most things (such as getting married, or collecting water). Even though they were "free" they still were controlled by the higher classes. The serfs got to live on the farms with the knights. The knights were there to protect them. The majority of peasants lived in houses which also housed the animals of the village.
