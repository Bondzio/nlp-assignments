Dodge Durango

The Dodge Durango is a full-sized SUV that was built by Chrysler's Dodge brand from 1998 to 2008. The Durango was discontinued in 2009 but returned in 2012 to share a platform with the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Durango had two generations, the first generation was a mid-sized SUV and was produced from 1998 to 2003 and the second generation which is a full-sized SUV and was produced from 2003-2008. Chrysler briefly sold a variation known as the Chrysler Aspen, which was discontinued due to low sales. The Durango is manufactured by DaimlerChrysler, Chrysler LLC and FCA US, LLC from 2010 to now. The Durango was discontinued because Chrysler closed down their Newark Assembly facility which manufactured the Durango. The customer can also order the Durango in a hybrid version. FCA recently announced the Durango will be phased out and the plant it's manufactured at will be converted into a Jeep plant, which will be building the upcoming Jeep Grand Wagoneer. The company also said the Durango might make a comeback in 2017.
