Hercules vs. the Moon Men

Hercules Against the Moon Men is a 1964 Italian/French movie. It was directed by Giacomo Gentilomo. It stars Alan Steel (real name Sergio Ciani). The movie "blends" elements from Roman, Greek, Cretan and Egyptian mythologies. In the original Italian language version, the hero was not Hercules. The hero was Maciste. Maciste was a hero in Italian silent movies. Its original Italian title was "Maciste e la regina di Samar" ("Maciste and the Queen of Samar"). Its French title was "Maciste contre les hommes de pierre" ("Maciste Against the Men of Stone"). The English distributors dubbed the hero Hercules, because Maciste was not well known to American audiences.

A race of evil moon men land on Earth. For years, they have terrorized the city of Samar. They have made the people of Samar give them children to be sacrifices. Now, the queen of Samar has made an pact with the moon men to take control of the world. She wants to become the most powerful woman alive. The people of Samar do not like all the chaos. They cheer when the mighty Hercules shows up to end it all.
