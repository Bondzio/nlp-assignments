Branch MRT Line

The Branch MRT Line was the third line of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network in Singapore. 

The 6.5-km line and three of the four stations on it opened in March 1990. Trains ran as a branch line of the East West Line. The trip from one end of this line to the other took about ten minutes. The line used six-car Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 and Siemens C651 trains as its rolling stock.

In February 1996, the North South Line was extended to Woodlands. The Branch MRT Line was merged into the North South MRT Line.
