Saturn Vue

The Saturn Vue is a compact crossover SUV that was built by General Motors' Saturn brand. The Vue was made by the Saturn Corporation from 2002 to 2005. The Vue was the first GM vehicle to utilize the Theta platform which has become global since it has replaced the GM SUV frames most notably the Chevrolet Blazer frame. In 2006 GM introduced the second generation of the Vue, built by Opel. Basically a rebadged Opel Antara with modifications for the American market. This generation of the Vue was sold from 2007-2009 until Saturn went defunct in 2010. The Vue is still being made under the General Motors company. General Motors reintroduced the Vue to fleets and companies as the Chevrolet Captiva Sport. In September 2014 GM announced that it would discontinue the Captiva Sport due to the introduction of its new subcompact CUV the Trax. Until 2012 the Vue was the only Saturn model that was re-introduced later followed by the Outlook's body style being used on the Acadia.
