Transatlantic telegraph cable

A transatlantic telegraph cable is a cable running under the Atlantic Ocean. It was used for telegraph communications. The first was laid across the bottom of the Atlantic from Ireland to Newfoundland. The first message was sent on August 16, 1858. It was from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan. The cables reduced the communication time between North America and Europe from ten days (by ship) to a matter of minutes. The first cable lasted only three weeks. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by transatlantic telecommunications cables.
