EFL Cup

The EFL Cup, known for most of its history as the Football League Cup and also known in the past by several sponsored names, is a national association football competition in England, with a few clubs in Wales also playing. It is like the FA Cup, but has fewer teams, and starts and ends earlier in the season.

Unlike the FA Cup, which is open to hundreds of clubs belonging to The Football Association, which runs football in England, the EFL Cup is open only to the 92 teams in the top four divisions of English footballâ€”those playing in the top-level Premier League and the English Football League, which includes the next three lower divisions.

Note: * means "after extra time"
