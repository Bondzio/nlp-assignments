Bobby Darin

Walden Robert Cassotto (May 14, 1936 â€“ December 20, 1973), better known as Bobby Darin, was an American pop singer, most famous during the 1950s. His hits included "Mack the Knife", "Dream Lover", "If I Were a Carpenter", "Splish Splash", and "Beyond the Sea". He also helped Wayne Newton begin his musical career.

Allen Klein, an accountant who became an artist manager, first came to public attention when he audited Darin's payments, and discovered Darin had been underpaid. His record company paid up, and Darin split the money with Klein.

Darin was married to actress Sandra Dee from 1960 to 1967. They had a son, named Dodd. Darin died late in 1973 after heart surgery.

In 2004, a movie, "Beyond the Sea", was made about Darin's life and career. Actor Kevin Spacey, a longtime Darin fan, produced and starred in the movie, with Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee.
