First language

A first language (also mother tongue, native language, arterial language, or L1) is the language a person first learns. A person's first language helps them understand words and concepts in the style of that first language.

Sometimes "first language" means the language a person speaks best (his second language is the language he speaks less well than his first language, etc.). In this case "first language", "second language" and "third language" show how well one speaks a language, so a person can have more than one first language or second language.
