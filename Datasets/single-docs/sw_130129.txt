Casey Calvert, who played guitar and did the death growls for the band, died on November 24, 2007, and another member found him in the morning. They had to push back touring etc., and had started on a tour already and had big plans.

Later, another person in the band, Micah Carli, started doing the harsh death growl vocals for the band.
