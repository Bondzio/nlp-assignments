Iron Act

The Iron Act was a law created by Great Britain in 1750 to make American Colonies import more Iron from Great Britain, and preventing the colonies from refining iron on their own.


The act was officially repealed in 1867.

Maryland and Virginia were the only colonies majorly affected. The act essentially stopped all creation of edged tools, nails, and tinplates. Great Britain had a history of creating acts designed to create more trade to England. This was one of the many acts that caused the American Revolution.
