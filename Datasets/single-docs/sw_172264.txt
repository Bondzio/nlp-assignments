Hurricane Floyd

Hurricane Floyd was the strongest, costliest, and deadliest hurricane of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd, at first looked as if it were headed for Florida as a category 4 hurricane. It was about twice as large as Hurricane Andrew, which if Floyd struck Florida it could have caused even more damage than Andrew. Instead of striking Florida, Floyd struck North Carolina and caused flooding from North Carolina up to some states in New England. Floyd left $4.5 billion in damage from Florida to Maine. Floyd also killed about 76-86 people in the United States. One person was also killed in the Bahamas.

The name Floyd got retired in the Spring of 2000. The name Franklin was used in 2005 instead.
