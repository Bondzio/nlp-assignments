Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia

Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia is a fear of the number 666. It comes from the Biblical verse Revelation 13:18, which says that the number 666 is the number of the beast, associated with Satan or the Antichrist.

A well-known example of this fear is Nancy and Ronald Reagan, who, in 1989, when moving to their home in Bel-Air, Los Angeles, had its address changed from 666 St. Cloud Road to 668 St. Cloud Road.
