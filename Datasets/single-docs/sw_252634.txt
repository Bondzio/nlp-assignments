Teimour Radjabov

Teimour Radjabov, born 12 March 1987 in Baku, Azerbaijan, is the leading Azerbaijani chess player. 

Radjabov earned the title of Grandmaster in March 2001 at the age of 14, making him the second-youngest grandmaster in history at that time (to Bu Xiangzhi). Radjabov's playing style has been described as attacking and tactically influenced.

Radjabov came second in the FIDE Grand Prix 2008â€“2010, qualifying him for the Candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship of 2012.

Radjabov is the youngest player ever to make the FIDE Top 100 Players list. His rating of 2599 in January 2002 ranked 93rd in the world while he was still 14 years old.

In 2003, Radjabov defeated Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, and Ruslan Ponomariov with the black pieces. He is probably the first player ever to beat three former and reigning FIDE World Chess Champions with the black pieces in one year.

Radjabov reached the semi-finals (earning a bronze medal) at the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.
