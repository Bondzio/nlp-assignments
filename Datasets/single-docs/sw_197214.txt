Log cabin

A log cabin is a house built from wooden logs. They were first built in Norway, but are usually associated with the woods areas of the United States. Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin, and that is the basis for the toy "Lincoln Logs". Log Cabins have also been a symbol in American politics, as some Presidents said they were born in log cabins to make them seem closer to the people." A group of Republicans who dislike some of the stands of the Republican Party call themselves "Log Cabin Republicans"..
