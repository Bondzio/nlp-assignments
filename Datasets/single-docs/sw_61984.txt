Leif Erikson

Leif Erikson (c. 970 â€“ c. 1020) was a Norse explorer. He was possibly the first European to travel to North America. Erikson was born in Iceland. His father was Erik the Red, who had created colonies in Greenland. Erikson is said to have visited North America long before anyone else in Europe did. According to Icelandic sagas (stories) the place he went to was Newfoundland in Canada. The Vikings called it Vinland. This theory is not supported by clear proof.
