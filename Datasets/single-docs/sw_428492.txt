Alloy wheels

Alloy wheels are automobile wheels that are made of an aluminum alloy instead of steel. Most new cars have alloy wheels, although steel wheels are still available on some cars (usually lower-priced or base-model cars). The first alloy wheels were made of magnesium alloys, but these are no longer made because the magnesium alloys were too weak and would eventually crack.
