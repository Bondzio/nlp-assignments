Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (Czech Republic)

The Cathedral of St. Ducha ("the holy spirit") is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. It was built in 1307. It was built by order of Eliška Rejčka because the church of St. Klement was too small. The church was burned and rebuilt several times between the 14th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, the church was plundered by Swedish soldiers. In 1664, Pope Alexander VII blessed the church as a cathedral. The last repairs were done after World War II.

The cathedral has an old Gothic altar from the end of the 15th century. It also has an early baroque altar from the 17th century. There is a portrait of St. Antoním by Petr Brandla, a pastoforium made by Matej Rejsem and a pulpit by Josef Myslbek. Under the cathedral are 3 crypts. There is a legend about one of them. In the legend, Jan Žižka z Trocnova, a famous Hussite commander, was buried there for a short time. In the towers are 4 bells named Leopold, Klement, Václav and Michal.
