Sapeornis

Sapeornis is a genus of primitive bird which lived during the Lower Cretaceous about 125120 million years ago (mya). Only one species is known: "Sapeornis chaoyangensis". The fossils are from the Jiufotang Formation and Yixian Formation rocks in the People's Republic of China. Several nearly complete skeletons have been found.

"Sapeornis" is named after SAPE, the "Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution", added to the Ancient Greek "όρνις" (ornis), meaning "bird". "chaoyangensis" is Latin for "from Chaoyang".

This animal was about 30–33 cm long. The skull has a handful of teeth in the upper jawtip only. A single tail feather has been found on one of the specimens. It may have been a glider or soarer rather than an active flier.
