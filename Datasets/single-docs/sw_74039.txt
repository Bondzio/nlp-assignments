National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a scientific agency of the United States government that is focused to monitor the oceans surrounding the United States and the atmosphere. NOAA warns people for dangerous weather, charts seas and sky, guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources, and conducts research to help understanding and stewardship of the environment. In addition to its civilian employees, NOAA research and operations are supported by 300 uniformed service members who make up the NOAA Corps.

NOAA is currently celebrating 200 years of Science, Service, and Stewardship.
