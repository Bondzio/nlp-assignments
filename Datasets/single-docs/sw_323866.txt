Kisarazu Air Field

The air field is north northwest of Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture. Private charter jets also use the airport 

JGSDF Kisarazu is home to the JGSDF 1st Helicopter Brigade. These forces are part of the Central Readiness Force. 

The immediate JGSDF response to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami included helicopters from the 1st Helicopter Unit.

After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, helicopters from Kisarazu sprayed seawater from above the plant onto the damaged reactor.

Kisarazu Air Field was originally established in 1936 as a base for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service in the Yokosuka Naval District.

After the end of World War II, the base was used by the United States Air Force (USAF) as "Kisarazu Air Base".

In 1955, the runway was expanded to multiple jet bomber operational length. 

In 1956, control of the base was officially transferred to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). Some USAF units remained.

By the 1960s, the US only used Kisarazu to repair United States Navy jets stationed on aircraft carriers in the Pacific. The US military units at this air field were withdrawn. 

In 1968, the JASDF relocated to Iruma Air Base, and Kisarazu was transferred to JGSDF.
