Semi-trailer truck

A semi-trailer truck, also known as a semi, tractor-trailer, big rig, eighteen-wheeler, or (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) articulated truck or articulated lorry, is a vehicle that has a towing tractor and a semi-trailer that carries the freight. They use diesel fuel.

A semi-tractor has no body and does not carry any cargo on it. The front of a semi-trailer is put on it. Only the rear of the trailers have wheels, so the tractor pulls the trailer and carries the front part of the trailer's weight.

The tractor and driver cost as much as a truck, but the trailers don't cost very much. You can have more trailers than tractors and the tractors can change trailers easily. You can park a trailer to be loaded or unloaded and take a different trailer away. The truck and driver do not have to wait to be loaded or unloaded, they can work most of the time. They can also pull different kinds of trailers, any type that is needed at the time.

A problem with semi's is that they often do not turn as sharp as a truck and full trailer that will carry the same load. This can be very important in the United Kingdom and Europe, but not in larger countries with wider roads.
