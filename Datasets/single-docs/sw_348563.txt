Daikakuji Seamount

The seamount is also known as the "Daikakuji Guyot" because it has a flat top. This undersea geologic feature is also called a "guyot" or "tablemount".

This seabed mountain is named after Daikaku-ji, which is a Buddhist temple long associated with the Imperial family.

The last eruption from Daikakuji seamount was 42 million years ago.
