A Perfect Circle

A Perfect Circle, often called APC by fans, is an alternative rock band. It was put together by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool lead singer Maynard James Keenan.

The band is made of Jeordie White - the bass player for Marilyn Manson, James Iha - who played guitar for The Smashing Pumpkins, and Josh Freese, who used to go on tour and play drums with Nine Inch Nails.

Although the group never officially broke up, A Perfect Circle has not performed or written anything since 2006. The band members still keep busy with other projects. On September 17, 2009, Keenan confirmed that new material from A Perfect Circle was on the way during a live radio interview with BJ Shea on Seattle rock station KISW.

The band's biggest hits have been "Judith", "Weak and Powerless", and "The Outsider". They have released the albums "Mer De Noms", "Thirteenth Step", and "Emotive".
