Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies

The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies (abbreviated CAPS) is an independent research organization, which started in July 2006. Its office is in Kabul, Afghanistan. This office is a research centre, which means that it is an important place where people can do independent research.
Most of CAPS' research is about governance, security, and developmental challenges (difficulties) in Afghanistan. 

Most research centres in Afghanistan have foreign - non-Afghan - workers, but the people who work at CAPS are from Afghanistan. CAPS is a place where people can discuss ways to change Afghanistan. The workers from CAPS tell other Afghan people about their research. They also discuss their research with people from other countries. When people from other countries come to Afghanistan to work, they can learn how to live in Afghanistan from CAPS.
