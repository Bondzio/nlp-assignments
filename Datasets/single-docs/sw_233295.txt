Regions of Chile

Chile is divided into 15 regions (in Spanish, "regiones"; singular "regi√≥n"), which are the first-level administrative division in the country. Each region is ruled by an intendant ("intendente"), designated by the President, and a body elected indirectly known as regional board ("consejo regional").

Regions are divided into provinces (second-level administrative division), each of them ruled by a governor ("gobernador"), designated by the President too. There are 54 provinces, in total. Provinces are further divided into communes (third and lowest level administrative division), which are governed by municipalities.
