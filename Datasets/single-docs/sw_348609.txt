Soft tennis

Soft tennis is major sport in Japan. It is usually played by two players with rackets. It is similar to normal tennis, but the ball is soft.
Young and old of both sexes can enjoy playing soft tennis because the racket and ball are light. 

Tennis came to Japan from England in about 1880's. 

In Japan, people were not able to make good hard ball those days. Imported balls were expensive. Therefore Japanese people used a rubber ball.
