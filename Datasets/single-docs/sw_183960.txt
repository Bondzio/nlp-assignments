Early modern period

The early modern period is a time from 15001800 (roughly). This time follows the Middle Ages. It is the start of recognizable nations that we know today.

In history, the early modern period follows the Medieval period. It begins around the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and includes the Renaissance period, and the Age of Discovery. It includes the discovery of America, and the discovery of the sea route to the East. It ends around the French Revolution in 1789.

In 1453 Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire. Science, transport, and communications improved. This is also called the Renaissance. For European countries with many ships, this was the Age of Discovery. Europe was beginning to expand to the New World. 
Trade with Asia was common, after Europeans found their way around Africa and into the Indian Ocean. Late in this period the European countries started setting up colonies there. 

The Mughal Empire began in 1526. This Empire had a orderly government, widespread economic prosperity and religious tolerance. At this time Asia was flourishing in Math and Science. Also the Ottoman Empire was ruling the Middle East, along with the Persian Empire.
