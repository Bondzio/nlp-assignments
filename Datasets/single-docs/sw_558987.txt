Stone slab

A stone slab is a big stone, flat and of little thickness, that are generally used for paving floors, for covering walls or as headstones.

Other definitions refine the meaning a bit more:

Most dolmen constructions they were build using stone slabs of big dimensions. Their architecture often includes a corridor of access that can be constructed usins stone slabs or dry stones. The burial chamber, with variable shapes (rectangular, polygonal, oval, circular ...) can also be preceded by an anteroom. In some dolmens, the entrance has a door cut into one or more vertical stone slabs.

The main applications of the slabs as material of construction are for pavings and in the construction of roofs. But they can be employed for other uses, among them:

From prehistoric times there are examples of graves covered with a stone slab, in its natural state or carved. This use as tombstone has extended the concept of natural slab to the tombstone variant: flat, thin and polished. Example: the tomb of King Peter the Great,

The tombstones use to have some inscriptions. The information on the stone slab traditionally includes the name of the deceased and his date of birth and death. The inscriptions are generally in the frontal side of the stone slab but also in some cases in the verso and around the edges of the slab, some families request to write an inscription in the unseen part of the stone slab (oriented to the ground). Apart from the name, some slabs also have epitaphs in praise of the deceased or citations of religious texts, as "Requiescat in pace".
