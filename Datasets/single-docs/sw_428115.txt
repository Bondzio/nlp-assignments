Cranes (band)

Cranes are a British dream pop band. Their most well known song is perhaps "Shining Road". They started in 1989 in Southsea, Portsmouth, England. The band's starting members were Alison Shaw, the singer, her brother Jim Shaw, and guitarist Kevin Dunford. In fact the guitarist preferred to be known as Mark and had diverse musical influences such as Lou Reed and MC 900 foot Jesus (but not Frank Zappa). He also liked building experimental computer-based devices to alter his guitar-sound as well as wearing experimental hair. In 1989 their EP "Self Non Self" was released by Bite Back. In 1990 they released an EP called "Inescapable". It was their first release on the record label Dedicated. Later in 1990 they released another EP, "Espero".

Their first album, "Wings of Joy", was released in 1991. It reached number fifty-two in the UK Album Chart. In 1992 they performed at The Cure's Wish Tour. Their second album "Forever" was released in 1993. It got to number forty in the UK. The single "Jewel" reached number twenty-nine in the UK Singles Chart. It was their best-selling single.

Their third album "Loved" was released in 1994. Three singles were released from the album: "Lilies", "Shining Road", and "Beautiful Friend". That year Dunford left the band. In 1996 Cranes released 10,000 copies of "La Tragédie d'Oreste et Électre". In the album Shaw sings in French. The next year "Population 4" was released. It was their last album on Dedicated.

In 1997 the band broke up. In 2000 they reformed. They released "Future Songs" in 2001. In 2002 they performed before The Cure at Hyde Park. They released an EP called "Submarine".
