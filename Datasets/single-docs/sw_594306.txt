Arrondissement of Chartres

The arrondissement of Chartres is an arrondissement of France, in the Eure-et-Loir department of the Centre-Val de Loire region. Its capital is the city of Chartres.

When the Eure-et-Loir department was created on 1800, the "arrondissement" of Chartres was part of that original department.

The "arrondissement" of Chartres is the most eastern of the "arrondissements" of the Eure-et-Loir department. It is the largest "arrondissement" of the department, and the one with more people living in it, with 207,869 inhabitants.

It is bordered to the north by the "arrondissement" of Dreux, to the northeast by the Yvelines department, to the east by the Essonne department, to the southeast by the Loiret department, to the south by the "arrondissement" of Châteaudun and to the west by the "arrondissement" of Nogent-le-Rotrou.

After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the "arrondissements" so they could have "communes" that belong to different "arrondissements".
