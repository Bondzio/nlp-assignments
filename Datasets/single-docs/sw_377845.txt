Air Force Instruction

An Air Force Instruction (AFI) is a documented instruction for members of the United States Air Force. It is intended for use by active duty, guard, and reserve members and associated civilians. It is one of many forms of directives published by the Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO). In almost all cases, an Air Force Instruction is a form of a general order; and violation of the AFI by an Airman subject to it can be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
