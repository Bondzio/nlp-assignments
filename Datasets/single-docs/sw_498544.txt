Fissure vent

A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure or eruption fissure, is a kind of volcano through which lava erupts. The crack is usually linear (follows a fairly straight line). It is often a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood of lava and later lava tubes. After some time the eruption cools down gradually and builds up craters.
