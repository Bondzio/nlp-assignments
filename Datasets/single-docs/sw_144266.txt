Bill Henson

Bill Henson (born 1955 in Melbourne) is an Australian art photographer. Bill Henson's works provoked a controversy; at one of his exhibitions, police found images of nude teenagers. Police first wanted to charge Henson for child pornography, but then did not. Instead, the exhibition was rated "parental guidance". This means that people under 16 should be accompanied by their parents.
