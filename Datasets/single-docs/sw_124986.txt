Barisal Division

Barisal (also spelt BarisƒÅl) is a division of south-central Bangladesh. It used to be a district called Bakerganj. It is now one of 6 divisions of Bangladesh, but before Bangladeshi independence it was formerly part of East Pakistan as a district. The town of Barisal was under the control of the Roychoudhury family, which now has moved to Calcutta. 

In 1797 the area was established as Bakerganj District but later renamed as Barisal District.

Kuakata beach is the main tourist spot in the division. It is one of the two sea beaches in South Asia where both sunrise and sunset at sea can be seen.

Durga Sagor is another beautiful Dighi where a number of migratory birds arrive every winter.
