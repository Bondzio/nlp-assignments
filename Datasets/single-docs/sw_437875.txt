Raymond Williams

Raymond Henry Williams (31 August 1921 â€“ 26 January 1988) was a Welsh academic, novelist and critic. 

He was an important person in the New Left movement and in wider culture. His writings on politics, culture, the mass media and literature are a significant contribution to the Marxist critique of culture and the arts. 

Some 750,000 copies of his books have sold in UK editions alone and there are many translations available. His work laid the foundations for the field of cultural studies and the cultural materialist approach.
