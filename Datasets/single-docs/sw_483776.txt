Seguridad Social

Seguridad Social is a Spanish rock music band from Benetússer, Valencia. It was founded in 1982 by José Manuel Casany (also Casañ) (vocalist) and Santiago Serrano (guitar).

Casany met him when he was a member of Paranoicos. After that Serrano left his former band and joined to his friend's group. However they stopped their music career due their military services. Before leaving to go into the armed forces, they signed a contract with Citra label. One year later both returned to the band.

In 1984 Seguridad Social released its first LP: "El desconcierto".

The 90's were a big change for the band. Most of its members left Seguridad Social. They were replaced by Javi Vela (guitar/vocalist), Alex Olías (bass/vocalist) and Rafa Villalba (drummer).
