Lifestyle

Lifestyle is the way of life of person, group, or culture.
The term "lifestyle" was used for first time by Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler (1870-1937). 

A lifestyle is a way of living or doing things. Lifestyle is doing things, living your life and making decisions in your own unique way. Lifestyle can be political, social, economical and personal way of seeing, doing and understanding things. Not all parts of a lifestyle are our decisions. Surrounding social and technical systems, like economical situation and people around us, can limit the lifestyle choices available to the individual.
