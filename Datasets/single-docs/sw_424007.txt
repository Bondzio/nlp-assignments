A.J. Styles

Allen Neal Jones (born March 2, 1977) better known by his ring name AJ Styles or the phenomenal one, is an American professional wrestler. He is currently wrestling for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He is best known for working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where he along with James Storm and Jeff Jarrett were the only wrestlers to have worked continuously for the promotion since its first broadcast on June 19, 2002.

He was the first wrestler to complete the TNA Triple Crown Championship when he won the TNA X Division, NWA World Tag Team, and NWA World Heavyweight Championships. He is also the first wrestler to complete it more than once when he completed it five more times.

On December 8, 2013, it was announced by TNA that Styles' contract negotiations had failed. He was later released from the company and will be a free agent on December 17.

On March 27, 2014, Styles signed a contract with New Japan Pro Wrestling. He debuted at Invasion Attack 2014 on April 6 where he attacked the IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada and hit his finishing move, the "Styles Clash" on him. Styles then said that he was the new leader of Bullet Club. This came after Prince Devitt, the former leader of Bullet Club, had to leave the company after losing a Loser Leaves Town match against his rival Ryusuke Taguchi.
