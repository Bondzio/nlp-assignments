Acoustic guitar

An acoustic guitar is a string instrument. It is usually played with a plectrum and sometimes with the fingers. The sounds build up inside the guitar's body, going out through a sound hole. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles.
