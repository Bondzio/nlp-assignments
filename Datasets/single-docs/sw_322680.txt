Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)

Mr. Johnson is a character in "Sesame Street". He is Grover's regular customer at Charlie's Restaurant and other restaurants as well. He is a fat Anything Muppet who has become increasingly frustrated over the years with the service Grover provides (however, in the earlier skits, Mr. Johnson was calmer and Grover was the one who would get irritated, but as the years went by, the situation reversed). Mr. Johnson was mainly performed by Jerry Nelson, and is mostly seen as a customer at Charlie's Restaurant. Mr. Johnson is always called "Sir" politely by Grover.
