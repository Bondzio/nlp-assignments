Division of Batman

The Division of Batman is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. It was created in 1906 and replaced the Division of Northern Melbourne. It takes its name from John Batman, one of the founders of the city of Melbourne. At first it covered the inner suburbs of Carlton and Fitzroy, but as the boundaries have been changed it has moved north. It now includes Alphington, Clifton Hill, Northcote, Preston, Reservoir and Thornbury. 

Brian Howe was the Deputy Prime Minister in the Hawke and Keating governments. Martin Ferguson was the leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) before being elected. David Feeney was elected to the Australian Senate in 2007, and resigned to take up a seat in the House of Representatives.
