Birmingham Children's Crusade

The Children's Crusade was a protest march by thousands of school students in Birmingham, Alabama, from May 2-5, 1963. They left school to march for civil rights. Police officers tried to stop them by using fire hoses and police dogs to attack the children. Then the police arrested as many as they could, released them only to have them marching again the next day. They marched to protest the city of Birmingham, Alabama's racial segregation laws. The Children's Crusade proved to be more effective than earlier civil rights protests. A few days later, on May 10, city officials agreed to desegregate the stores in downtown Birmingham.

Reverend James Bevel of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) suggested to Martin Luther King, Jr., who was directing the Birmingham desegregation efforts at the time, that they try a protest made up of children. In May of 1963, over 3,000 youths and teenagers gathered in Birmingham to march on city hall. While marching students faced off against police officers armed with dogs and fire hoses. Director of Public Safety, "Bull" Connor, ordered officers to arrest the children that were marching because they did not have a permit.
