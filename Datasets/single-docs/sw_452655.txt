Rumor

A rumor or rumour is often thought as myth or tall tale surrounding a person that might or might not be true. However, a review of the research on rumor made by Pendleton in 1998 found that research across sociology, psychology, and communication studies had made definitions of rumor. The word "rumor" became known during the 1920s and was used as propaganda.
