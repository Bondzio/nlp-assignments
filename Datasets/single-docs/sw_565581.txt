Parts of a sail

In sailing the parts of a sail have certain terms that clearly describe them.


The headsail of a sailboat is any sail set forward of the mast (on a single masted boat) or foremast (the mast nearest the bow). The part names remain the same but the sail is reversed from that of the mainsail.
