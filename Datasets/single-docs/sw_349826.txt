Gilbert and Sullivan

Gilbert and Sullivan were two men who worked together during the late 19th century to write fifteen well known operas. W. S. Gilbert wrote the words to the operas, while Arthur Sullivan was the composer who wrote the music.

Their operas are still commonly performed today, and some have been turned into movies. Many of the operas are very funny, and the songs are often parodied.
