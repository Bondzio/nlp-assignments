Decagon

A decagon is a shape with 10 sides and 10 corners (vertices), and usually refers to a regular decagon, having all sides of equal length and each internal angle equal to 144°.

The area of a regular decagon is: (with "t" = edge length)

An alternative formula is formula_2 where "d" is the distance between parallel sides, or the height when the decagon stands on one side as base.<br> 
By simple trigonometry formula_3.

The side of a regular decagon inscribed in a unit circle is formula_4, where "ϕ" is the golden ratio, formula_5.
