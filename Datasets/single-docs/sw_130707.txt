The Blister Exists

"The Blister Exists" is the final single from Slipknot's "Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)" album. A music video for the song was released May 21st 2004. "The Blister Exists" is known among fans for its snare drum solo. This song was used to open concerts from The Subliminal Verses tour, following a staged announcement where the audience was told that "due to unforeseen circumstances, Slipknot will not be performing this evening." The song appeared in the video game "Prince of Persia: Warrior Within".

The music video displays the band performing the song live, with clips of their fans with much similarity to "The Nameless" music video.
