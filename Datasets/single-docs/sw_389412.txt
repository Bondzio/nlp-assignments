Limón

Puerto Limón is the capital city of Limón Province in Costa Rica. It is also a major Costa Rican port for exporting and importing. A part of the community has its roots in Jamaican laborers. They worked on the nineteenth-century railroad project. The railroad connected San José to Puerto Limón. Other parts of the population have their roots in the Nicaraguan, Panamanian, and Colombian turtle-hunters who settled in the city. 

Puerto Limon suffered the 1991 Limon Earthquake. This earthquake affected the city and the coastline.

It was the capital of Costa Rica at the time. The pirates were driven away by the inhabitants of Turrialba on 15 April. This pirate army left on 16 April and arrived in Portete on 23 April. They left Costa Rica and did not return again.
