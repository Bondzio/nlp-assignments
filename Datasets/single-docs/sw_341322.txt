Newport Aquarium

The Newport Aquarium is a public aquarium in Newport, Kentucky, United States.

In the aquarium's first gallery, nine displays show freshwater fish from five continents of the world. There are hundreds of species in these exhibits, from the rainforests of Australia, the wetlands and caves of North America, tall grasses of Asia, the Amazon of South America, and the center of Africa. The tanks in World Rivers hold 9,000 gallons of freshwater.


This gallery has over 500 animals in eight different exhibits. These are animals that live in the shallow areas of a water's edge. The tanks in the Shore Gallery hold 6,120 gallons of water. This includes a touch pool where visitors can touch species of the New England shoreline in a 1,200 gallon, rocky, open-topped exhibit. The Surge Zone depicts an area of Hawaii where waves crash against the rocky shore and create tide pools.
