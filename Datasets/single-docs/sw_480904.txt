Williamsburg Bridge

The Williamsburg Bridge is a suspension bridge in New York City. It goes between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bridge opened on December 19, 1903. It is free to cross.

The bridge was built starting in 1896. It cost $24,200,000. Until 1924, it was the world's longest suspension bridge.

The bridge has been rebuilt since the 1980s. It was closed in 1988 after cracks were found on the bridge. A bicycle lane was also built on the bridge.

In 2003, the bridge turned 100 years old. On June 22, 2003, people held a party on the bridge to celebrate the bridge's age. In 2009, the bridge was made a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

There are two New York City Subway tracks in the middle of the bridge. There also used to be trolley tracks on the bridge.
