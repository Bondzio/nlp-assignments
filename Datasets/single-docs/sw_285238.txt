Horizon League

The Horizon League is a NCAA conference that plays in the NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana and features universities and colleges from the Great Lakes Region. While it plays many sports, it has never played football.

The Horizon League was founded in 1979 as the Midwestern City Conference (MCC) with six members. None of these schools are in the league now. The school that has been in the league the longest is Detroit, which joined in 1980.

The conference changed its name in 1985 to Midwestern Collegiate Conference. In 1993, the largest conference expansion in NCAA history that did not involve a merger was announced. Six schools left the Mid-Continent Conference, now known as The Summit League, to join the Midwestern Collegiate Conference for the 1994–95 school year. In June 2001, the conference changed its name to the current Horizon League to avoid confusion with the "other" MCC (which did not become The Summit League until 2007).

Today, eight of the Horizon League's 10 full members (those playing most, if not all, of their sports in the league) are former members of The Summit League. The only exceptions are longtime member Detroit and 2015 arrival Northern Kentucky.

Currently, the Horizon League has 10 full members.

The Horizon League has one "associate" member that plays only one sport in the conference, Belmont University, but the school will leave the Horizon League after the 2017–18 school year for single-sport membership in the Southern Conference. 
A total of 14 schools have been full members, but are no longer in the league.

Nicknames are those used when the schools were conference members.
