Jenson Button

Jenson Alexander Lyons Button, MBE (born 19 January 1980 in Frome, Somerset) is a British Formula One driver currently signed to McLaren Mercedes. Button won the Formula One World Drivers' Champion in 2009. His father John Button (1943-2014) was a racing driver.

In 2000, Button joined the BMW WilliamsF1 Team at the age of 20, with Ralf Schumacher. He became the youngest driver to score a point at the Brazilian Grand Prix. He scored points six times during 2000, his highest place finish being in Germany where he finished fourth. His highest place on the grid for the start of the race was 3rd position in Belgium. He scored 12 points that year, and finished 8th in the championship. 

In 2001, he changed teams to the Benetton team, and raced alongside Giancarlo Fisichella. He did not have much success. His best finish was 5th place at Hockenheim. Some people thought that Button would move teams because of his bad results, but stayed at the team for 2002, which was now called Renault. His results were much better than in 2001, scoring in the points many times and doing better than his teammate Jarno Trulli. He almost scored a podium result in Barcelona, but could not finish the race. Even though Button was doing well, Briatore signed Fernando Alonso for 2003, and Button had to find a new team. In July 2002, he signed for the BAR team, and would race with Jacques Villeneuve, who won the championship in 1997. Button finished the season in seventh with fourteen points, just ahead of Trulli.
