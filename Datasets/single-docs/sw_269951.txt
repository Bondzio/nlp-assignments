Cash register

A cash register, or till, is a machine that holds money. Cash registers are usually found in stores and restaurants. Sometimes the cash register will only open if somebody is buying something. This is to try to stop the customer from stealing money from the employees. Most cash registers print a receipt for a proof of purchase.
