Joanna Clare "Jo" Yeates (1985 â€“ December 2010), was a 25 year-old English woman who disappeared on 17 December 2010 in Bristol. Yeates' boyfriend reported her missing on 19 December. An investigation into her disappearance was soon afterwards started. Yeates' dead body was found on 25 December. Police stated that she had been strangled and had been dead for several days before being found. On 30 December, Yeates' landlord, 65-year-old Christopher Jefferies, was arrested on suspicion of Yeates' murder, and was released on bail in early 2011. Avon and Somerset Police received help from a criminal profiler, clinical forensic psychologist Doctor Glenn Wilson who has worked on other high profile criminal cases.

In October 2011, Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 20 years.
