Abelian group

In group theory, an abelian group is a group that is commutative. 

An abelian group is a set, "A", together with an operation "â€¢". It combines any two elements "a" and "b" to form another element denoted . For the group to be abelian, the operation and the elements must follow some requirements. These are known as the "abelian group axioms":


An abelian group is a commutative group. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a "non-abelian group" or "non-commutative group".
