Planet Dinosaur

Planet Dinosaur is a six-part documentary television series produced by the BBC, narrated by John Hurt, first aired in the United Kingdom in 2011, produced by VFX studio Jellyfish Pictures. It is the first major dinosaur-related series for BBC One since "Walking with Dinosaurs". There are more than 50 different prehistoric species featured, and they and their environments were created entirely as computer-generated images, for only a third of the production cost that was needed a decade earlier for "Walking with Dinosaurs". By the time the third episode aired, the companion book to the series was released accompany it. The DVD will be released after the series finishes.

CBBC aired a spin-off, "Planet Dinosaur Files", from 29 September, 2011, hosted by Jem Stansfield. Each episode compares three Mesozoic creatures and involves practical tests to replicate certain behaviours in an attempt to find out which creature holds a certain title, such as the "most powerful" theropod.

Tom Sutcliffe in the "Independent" found that it was visually "polished and jazzed up" but that the "knowledge and science generally take second place to B-movie spectacle".
