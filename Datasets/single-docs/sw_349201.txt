List of active volcanos

List of active volcanoes includes volcanoes which are erupting, or have erupted in modern times. Many volcanos have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years, but are not erupting at this moment. Some scientists consider a volcano "active" if it has erupted in the holocene (historic times) period.

Most volcanoes live many thousands of years and erupt many times. However, most don't erupt even once in a human lifespan. Signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions are signs that a volcano is active. An example of an active volcano is Mount St. Helens in the United States (US).

There are more than 1,500 volcanoes that could be active today. An estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes.

Planet Venus has more volcanos than Earth. Some may be active.
