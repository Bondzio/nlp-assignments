Matsukata Kojiro

Matsukata was the son of Matsukata Masayoshi who was a Prime Minister of Japan during the Meiji Period.

Matsukata became president of Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company ("Kawasaki Shōzō") in 1896. 

Masukata bought thousands of Western paintings and sculpture including Auguste Rodin's "The Thinker" and "Gates of Hell." The Rodin sculptures in the NMWA entrance plaza were made from the same original casting as at the Rodin Museum in France. In fact, Matsukata actually paid for the best Rodin castings in France today.

Some works collected by Matsukata are today in the French national collection of art. 

Matsukata's art collection was first seen by the Japanese public in 1959.
