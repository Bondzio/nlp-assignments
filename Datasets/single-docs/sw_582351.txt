The Baseline Move (Michael Jordan)

The Baseline Move was a play made by Michael Jordan in Game 3 of the 1991 NBA Eastern Conference First Round against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The play occurred near the end of the first half. Jordan caught the ball near the left hash mark and was immediately double teamed by Kiki Vandeweghe and John Starks. Jordan broke the double team with a left dribble down the bounds line and then towards the basket along the left baseline, only to be greeted by Charles Oakley and another double team with Starks playing help defense. Jordan reversed his dribble in his left hand and dribbled out towards the left corner, bringing the defense of Oakley and Starks away from the basket. He then reversed his dribble again, escaped both Starks and Oakley, drove to the basket and finished with a right-handed slam dunk over Patrick Ewing, who fouled Jordan on the play.
