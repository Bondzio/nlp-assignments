Division of Brand

The Division of Brand is an Australian electoral division in the state of Western Australia. The division was named after Sir David Brand, a former state premier. It was created in 1984 because of the large increase in population. It covers an area of 411 kmÂ² south of Perth. It includes the City of Kwinana, City of Rockingham and the northern section of the City of Mandurah.

According to the 2006 census, Brand is the electorate with the lowest proportion (12.6%) of residents with a university qualification.

Wendy Fatin was Minister for the Arts in the early 1990s. Kim Beazley was Minister for Defence in the Hawke Government, and Deputy Prime Minister to Paul Keating. He took over the seat in 1996. He had been the member for Swan but changes in the boundaries showed he would lose it. At the 1996 election, Beazley won Brand by just 387 votes. Gary Gray is Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister for Tourism and Minister for Small Business in the Rudd Government.
