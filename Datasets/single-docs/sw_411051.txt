Division of Northern Melbourne

The Division of Northern Melbourne was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It was one of the first 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It was located in the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne, including the suburbs of Carlton, North Melbourne and Fitzroy. It was abolished in 1906 when the boundaries were redrawn and mostly replaced by the Division of Batman.

The division was held by one member, H. B. Higgins. Higgins was Attorney General from 1904 to 1905. He was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Australia in 1906. Isaac Selby, who was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1901 election, became famous in 1905 when he tried to shoot a judge during a court case in San Francisco.
