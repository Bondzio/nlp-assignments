List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A–F

This is a complete alphabetical list of Medal of Honor recipients during the American Civil War. This list only has the people with last names starting from A–F. Many of the medals received during the Civil War were for capturing or saving regimental flags. During the Civil War these regimental flags served as the rallying point for the unit. They also served as guids for the unit's movements. These flags were usually heavily protected. Loss of the flag could greatly disrupt a unit. It could also have a greater effect than the death of the commanding officer.

The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself "…conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States…". Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient was killed (posthumously).

Recipients are listed alphabetically by last name. Posthumous receipt is denoted by an asterisk. The rank indicated is the individual's rank at the time of their Medal of Honor action.
