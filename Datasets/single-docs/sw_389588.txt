Urinary system

The urinary system controls urine. It includes the kidneys, nephron, ureters, bladder, and urethra. 
The kidneys remove waste chemicals from the blood like urea. The blood containing chemical wastes enters the kidneys through the renal arteries. The blood is processed through the nephron.
