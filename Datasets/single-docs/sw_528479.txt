Lycra

Lycra is a type of synthetic fabric that is very elastic. It is also called Spandex or elastane. The name "spandex" is an anagram of the word "expands". 

Lycra was invented in 1958 in Waynesboro, Virginia, United States. It was invented by Joseph Shivers, a chemist working for DuPont. It is made from a combination of polyester and polyurethane. It was introduced in 1962.

Because of its elasticity and strength, lycra is often used to make clothing. It is commonly mixed with cotton to make things like tights, bras and underwear. Lycra is especially common in sports clothing, such as wrestling singlets. It is also often used to make swimsuits and wetsuits, because lycra dries more quickly than many other fabrics.
