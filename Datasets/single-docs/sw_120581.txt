Anabaptist

Anabaptists are Protestant Christians of the Radical Reformation of 16th century Europe. The followers of these movements think that believers should be baptized; only someone who believes can be validly baptized; the baptism of infants has to be confirmed with what they call "believers baptism". The best-known Anabaptists today are the Mennonites, the Amish, and the Hutterites.
