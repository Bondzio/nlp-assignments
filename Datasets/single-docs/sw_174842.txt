Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch

Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch is a direct-to-video animated sequel to the 2002 Disney movie "Lilo & Stitch" and taking place before "Stitch! The Movie" and other additions to the franchise. It was originally planned for a theatrical release (like "The Jungle Book 2)", but was released to DVD and VHS on August 30, 2005.

Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is different than a deleted opening, "Stitch's trial", which was seen on the DVD release of Lilo & Stitch). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have problems. Lilo thinks Stitch is not behaving right, until she finds out that Stitch is dying.


Lilo & Stitch 2: Island Favorites is the soundtrack of the movie. Released on August 30, 2005, by Walt Disney Records, it is the sequel to the original movie's soundtrack.
