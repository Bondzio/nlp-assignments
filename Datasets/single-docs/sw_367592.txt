Black rhinoceros

The black rhinocerous ("Diceros bicornis"), is a species of rhinoceros. It lives in eastern and central Africa including Kenya, Tanzania, Cameroon, South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Angola. The black rhinoceros is not actually black, but dark. It is a browser, with lips that help eating from low branches.

The other African rhinoceros is the white rhinoceros ("Ceratotherium simum"). The white rhinoceros is not white, but lighter coloured.
