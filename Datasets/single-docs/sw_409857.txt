Wasps RFC

Wasps are an English rugby club historically based in London, but playing home games in Coventry, who play in the Aviva Premiership.

Formed in 1867 at the now defunct Eton and Middlesex Tavern, Wasps had been, before their December 2014 move to Coventry, London's most successful club with six championships and two Heineken Cups.

The club have not played their home games in London proper since 2002. They first moved to Adams Park in High Wycombe, but were unable to expand the stadium to meet their needs. In late 2014, they bought Ricoh Arena in Coventry, and moved their home matches there in December 2014.
