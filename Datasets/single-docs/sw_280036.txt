Titanosaurus

Titanosaurus was a genus of sauropod dinosaur, first described by Lydekker in 1877 from fragments, but not confirmed by later research. 

Titanosaurus was 9-12 metres (30-40 ft) long and weighed about 13 tons. Titanosaurus has traditionally been treated as a "wastebasket taxon" for poorly preserved sauropod remains. The most well-known species of Titanosaurus, "Titanosaurus" colberti, has been renamed "Isisaurus". The remains were from the Upper Cretaceous of India.
