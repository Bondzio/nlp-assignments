Jörð

Jörð (or Jord) is a giantess (jötun) and goddess in Norse mythology. She is the personification of Earth. Her name means "Earth". She is also called Fjörgyn.

Jörð is the wife of Odin, king of the gods, and the mother of Thor. Her parents are Annar and Nótt.

Snorri Sturluson says Jörð was included among the Asynjur. Her name occurs most often in Skaldic and Eddic poetry in phrases that refer to Thor as "the son of Jörð". There is some confusion, however, because in some parts of the Poetic Edda the word "Fjörgyn" appears in phrases referring to Thor, such as in the poem "Voluspa", where Thor is described as "the son of Fjörgyn". Scholars explain the confusion by pointing out that Fjörgyn, as an Old Norse noun, means "earth" when used in the feminine form.
