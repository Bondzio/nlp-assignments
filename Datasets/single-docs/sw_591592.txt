Uighur alphabet

The Uighur alphabet, or Uyghur alphabet, is the alphabet created by the Uighurs to read and write the Uighur language. It is based off the Arabic alphabet. Unlike the Arabic alphabet, however, Uighur has entire letters to write vowels rather than just diacritics, and writing vowels in Uighur is not optional.
