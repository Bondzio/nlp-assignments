List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Spanishâ€“American War

The Spanish-American War (, "desastre del 98", "Guerra Hispano-Cubana-Norteamericana" or "Guerra de Cuba ") was a military conflict between Spain and the United States. It began in April 1898. Hostilities halted in August of that year. The Treaty of Paris was signed in December.

The war began after America demanded Spain peacefully end the Cuban fight for independence. The demand was rejected. Strong expansionist sentiment in the United States may have motivated the government to target Spain's remaining overseas territories. These territories included Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and the Caroline Islands.

Riots in Havana by pro-Spanish "Voluntarios" gave the United States a reason to send in the warship . It was sent to indicate high American interest. Tension among the American people was raised because of the explosion of the . "Yellow journalism" added to it accusing Spain of doing a lot of bad things. This made the American public opinion show increased support of the conflict. The war ended after decisive naval victories for the United States in the Philippines and Cuba.

The Treaty of Paris ended the conflict 109 days after the outbreak of war. That gave the United States ownership of the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam.

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented to the recipient after they are killed (posthumously).
