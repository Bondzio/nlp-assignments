Court order

A court order (or order) is a formal written direction by a member of the judiciary. It directs a party to do something. It can also be an order not to do something, as in an injunction. 

An order can be as simple as setting a date for trial. They can also be involving many details. It may be a final order (one that concludes the court action), or an order (one during the action). Most orders are written, and are signed by the judge. Some orders, however, are spoken orally by the judge in open court, and are only reduced to writing in the transcript of the proceedings.

The following represents a small sampling of matters that are commonly dictated by the terms of a court order:
