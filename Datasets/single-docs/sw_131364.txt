Temple of the Dog

Temple of the Dog was an American rock band that was formed in 1990 by Chris Cornell of Soundgarden. He started the band as a tribute to his friend, Andrew Wood. Wood died on March 19, 1990 of a heroin overdose, the day Cornell got back from a tour. 

Before he died, Andrew had been the lead singer of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone.

Members of the band included Stone Gossard on rhythm guitar, Jeff Ament on bass guitar (both ex-members of Mother Love Bone), Mike McCready on lead guitar, Matt Cameron on drums and Eddie Vedder, providing backing vocals.

The band only released one album, which was also named "Temple of the Dog". The album was released in 1991 and had two hit songs, "Say Hello 2 Heaven" and "Hunger Strike". Cornell sang the lead vocals on "Say Hello 2 Heaven" and Vedder sang the lead vocals on "Hunger Strike".
