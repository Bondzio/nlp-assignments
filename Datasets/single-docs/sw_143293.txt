Case (grammar)

In grammar, case shows the role of a noun, adjective or pronoun in a sentence. It is a set of forms which depend on the syntax (how the words go together). Case is an example of inflection, which is an affix (a part of a word that is added to other words) that signals a grammatical relationship. Once it was part of Old English, but modern English does not use it much.

In the Romance languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, etc.), which are all derived from Latin, nouns pack several ideas into one word. These ideas are:

So, in many languages like Latin, German, Russian, Spanish, Korean and Japanese, a noun's case is shown by the end of the word (the nouns change depending on their role in the sentence). Nouns change their endings to show if they are doing an action, if they are having an action done to them, if they just happen to be there during the action and whether they own something. Therefore, the word order is less important in these languages, whereas in English it is vital.

In English we have only the remnants of this complicated system. We use word order and add auxiliary (helping) words as needed. 

English does have these cases for nouns and pronouns: "common case" and "genitive" (possessive). Each may take a plural. Examples:
In English adjectives are unchanged: "red hat", "red hats".
