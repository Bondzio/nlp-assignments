Tungusic languages

The Tungusic languages (also known as Manchu-Tungus, Tungus) are spoken in Eastern Siberia and Manchuria. Some linguists consider them to be part of the Altaic languages but many others do not think that this is correct. Many Tungusic languages are in danger, and the long-term future of the family is uncertain.

Linguists working on Tungusic have proposed a number of different classifications based on different criteria, including morphological, lexical, and phonological characteristics. 
Northern Tungusic
Following languages can be considered dialects or related languages of Evenki

Southern Tungusic

Jurchen-Manchu (Jurchen and Manchu are simply different stages of the same language).
