Immortal game

The Immortal Game was a chess game played on 21 June 1851 by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky. The number of pieces Anderssen gave up in order to win have made it one of the most well known chess games of all time. Anderssen gave up both rooks and a bishop, then his queen, checkmating his opponent with the remaining bishop and two knights.
