All I Ever Wanted

All I Ever Wanted is the fourth studio album by American pop rock singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson, released on March 6, 2009 in Australia and Germany, March 9, 2009 in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, March 10, 2009 in Canada, Mexico and the United States, and on March 13, 2009 in Italy. It was her second album to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200, making it Clarkson's second non-consecutive number-one album. "All I Ever Wanted" has been certified Gold in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.

"Masquerade" was originally chosen to be the title of the album but was changed to "All I Ever Wanted" because Clarkson felt that there were albums with similar themes currently on the charts, such as P!nk's "Funhouse" and Britney Spears' "Circus". "All I Ever Wanted" has sold 828,000 copies in the U.S. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.
