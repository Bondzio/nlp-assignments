Twink

Twink is a gay slang term. It describes a young or young-looking gay man in the 18â€“21 age range. A twink has a slender build. He has little or no body or facial hair. The term is sometimes used in a derogatory and pejorative manner by bears.

The twink's namesake is the Hostess Twinkie, a golden-colored, phallic-shaped, cream-filled snack cake thought to have little nutritional value. Qualifiers such as "muscle" or "femme" have narrowed the meaning of twink to a more specific type.
