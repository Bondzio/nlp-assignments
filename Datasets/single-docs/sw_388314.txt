Parcae

In Roman mythology, the Parcae (singular, Parca) were the female personifications of destiny. They are often called the Fates in English. Their Greek equivalent were the Moirai. They controlled the "thread of life" of every mortal and immortal. Even the gods feared the Parcae. 

The names of the three Parcae were:

The earliest known documents about these deities are three small stelae "(cippi)". They were found near ancient Lavinium shortly after World War II. They have the inscription:
"Neuna fata, Neuna dono, Parca Maurtia dono"
The names of two of the three Roman Parcae are recorded ("Neuna" = Nona, "Maurtia" = Morta) and connected to the concept of "fata".

One of the sources for the Parcae is "Metamorphoses" by Ovid, II 654, V 532, VIII 452, XV 781.
