Candy

Candy is a sweet kind of food that is usually made from sugar and water, with flavors and other ingredients added. 
The word "candy" comes from the Persian word for "cane sugar",(نیشکر), and probably also from Sanskrit khanda, which means "piece (of sugar)".

Candy is found in almost any store because they are made in many companies. Candy can also be made at home. Many people like candy and think it tastes good. Other people do not like it. Candy contains lots of sugar, so it is not very healthy, but can be eaten sometimes. It is the most common snacking food, and there are hundreds of flavors, shapes, and sizes.
