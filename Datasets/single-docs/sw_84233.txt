Foreign Secretary

The Foreign Secretary is the Minister in charge of the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In many countries this job is called Foreign minister.

Until the 1960s, the Foreign Secretary only handled relations with foreign countries and international organisations. There was a separate Commonwealth Secretary and a Colonial Secretary, but all three are now joined into one.

The Foreign Secretary's is one of the four Great Offices of State. As of 2016 the job is held by Boris Johnson.
