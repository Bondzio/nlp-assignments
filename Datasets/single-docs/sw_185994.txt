Cheongsam

Cheongsam is typical, traditional clothing for Chinese women. Also known as Qipao (Ch'ipau).

A cheongsam usually has two long slits at either side of the hem for convenient movement and display of the legs. Unlike a short skirt, the slits of cheongsam show a woman's legs when she walks.
