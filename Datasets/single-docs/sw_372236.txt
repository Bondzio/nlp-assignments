Sher Shah Suri

Sher Shah Suri (1486 â€“ 1545) (birth name Farid Khan, but also known as Sher Khan), was the founder of the short-lived Pashtun Suri, or Sur, kingdom in the Indian subcontinent, with its capital at Delhi. 

Farid Khan was a talented, bold and dynamic soldier who rebelled against the Mughal Empire and overthrew the government of the Emperor Humayun in 1540, and ruled instead until his death in 1545. On taking the throne he took the title 'Sher Shah'. His son and followers could not keep long control of the kingdom and in 1555 the Mughal Humayun was reinstated. 

Sher Shah Suri defeated the Mughal ruler Humayun twice and captured Delhi. Soon after becoming king Sher Shah Suri raised a large army and captured Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. 

Sher Shah was a good general and administrator. He introduced a new currency, a silver coin known as 'Rupia'. He reduced custom duties and built an excellent connection of roads, including Grand Trunk Road in Bihar. Sher Shah was a secular ruler who practised tolerance and welfare.

Sher Shah Suri was succeeded by Islam Shah. Humayun defeated Islam Shah in 1555, and ended the Sur dynasty.
