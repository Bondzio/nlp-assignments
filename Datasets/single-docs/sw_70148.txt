Reinforced concrete

Reinforced concrete is concrete with long bars inside to make it stronger. The reinforcing material has greater tensile strength than concrete has. Usually the bars are steel. Galvanizing saves the steel from rusting and corrosion. 
In rich countries, almost all concrete in buildings and roads is reinforced. Reinforced concrete is stronger than normal concrete.
