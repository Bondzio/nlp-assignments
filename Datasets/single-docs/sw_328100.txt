Chocolate Rain

"Chocolate Rain" is a song and music video by Tay Zonday. After being posted on YouTube on April 22, 2007, the song quickly became popular.

The song and video are licensed under a Creative Commons by-nc-nd license. Even though this license is not completely free, it has been suggested that the relative openness of the license has helped to encourage the song's spread. Creative Commons has praised Tay Zonday specifically for this very reason. Zonday has expressed his own thoughts on the licensing situation on his Myspace blog, stating, "I want non-profit radio and small mom/pop cafes to be able to play my music for free. But I also want giant corporations who can afford to give me a dime or two to pay fair royalties."
