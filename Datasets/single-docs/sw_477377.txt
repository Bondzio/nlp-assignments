Streisand effect

The Streisand effect is the name for a phenomenon: When an attempt is made to remove a piece of information (because it is not meant for the specific audience), it gets much more publicity than intended, and becomes known more widely. The effect is named after Barbara Streisand; Streisand made an attempt to get a photo of her house removed from a collection of thousands of photos of Malibu, California in 2003.
