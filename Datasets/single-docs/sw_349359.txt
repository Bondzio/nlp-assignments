Max Ernst

Max Ernst (2 April 1891-1 April 1976) was a German painter, and graphical artist. In 1919, he brought Dadaism to Germany, together with Johannes Theodor Baargeld. Dadasm is a movement in modern art that was created in Zürich, in 1916. In 1922, he left Germany and moved to Paris, where he joined a group of Surrealists led by André Breton. In 1951 he emigrated to the United States. He returned to France in 1953. With his paintings, collages, and sculptures he created mysterious combinations; very often he showed birds, very often in landscapes that mimic a forest. He also wrote poems, and works on art theory. He was the first to use the techniques called Frottage and Grattage in art.
