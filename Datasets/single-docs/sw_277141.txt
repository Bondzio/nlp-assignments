Lamborghini Gallardo

The Lamborghini Gallardo is a sportscar that has been built by Lamborghini since 2003 and is Lamborghini's most-produced model to date. The Gallardo is named after a type of fighting bull. Later, at the Geneva Motor Show 2014, the Gallardo was replaced by the Lamborghini Huracán, which is set to release in Spring 2014. There are also certain police car models of the Gallardo for certain countries like Italy and England. The Gallardo's superior model is the Lamborghini Murciélago. The Lamborghini V10 engine was so well made that Audi took the Engine and put the Engine into their sportscar the Audi R8.
