Trait (album)

Trait is the first, and only, EP by the industrial rock/metal band Pailhead. The original EP was released in 1988, containing the first four songs in a slightly different order. When re-released on CD in the early 90's, the group's first single ("I Will Refuse" b/w "No Bunny" 12") was added as a bonus.
