Sichuan

Sichuan () is a province in western China with its capital at Chengdu. It is also informally called 蜀 (). Its Governor is Wei Hong and its CPC Ctte Secretary is Wang Dongming. With a population of 87,250,000 (2006), Sichuan is the third most populated administrative division of China. Sichuan used to be the province with the most people in China before Chongqing was separated from it, making Henan the most populous. However, when including migrants, Guangdong has more people than Henan.

The name 四川 () is an abbreviation of 四川路 (, translated as "Four circuits/subdivisions of rivers"), which is itself shortened from 川峡四路 (, translated as "Four circuits of rivers and gorges").

There are 18 subdivisions within Sichuan, including both prefecture-level cities and autonomous prefectures:

Most people living in Sichuan are Han Chinese. There are also Tibetans, Yi people, Qiang and Naxi in the western side.

The Li Bai Memorial (located at his birthplace, Zhongba Town of northern Jiangyou County) is a museum in memory of the Chinese poet of the Tang Dynasty, Li Bai. It was prepared in 1962 on the occasion of 1,200th anniversary of his death, completed in 1981 and opened to the public in October 1982. The memorial is built in the style of the classic garden of the Tang Dynasty.
