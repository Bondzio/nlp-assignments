Flatbread

A flatbread is a bread made with flour, water, and salt. The flatbread is then rolled into flattened dough. Many flatbreads are made without yeast: they are unleavened bread. Some have a very little yeast, such as pita bread and naans.

There are many other ingredients that flatbreads may have. Curry powder, diced jalapeÃ±os, chili powder, black pepper, olive oil and sesame oil may be added. Flatbreads can range from one millimeter to a few centimeters thick.
