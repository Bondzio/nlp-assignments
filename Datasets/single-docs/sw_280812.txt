Counter-Strike

Counter-Strike is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360. It was made by Microsoft in 1999. In this game, you play as special United States soldiers disguised as terrorists and doing secret missions. One team plays as the terrorists and the other plays as the "counter" terrorists (official military soldiers). You play online against each other, each team having different objectives, or "goals" such as planting or defusing the bomb. This game was at first a fan-made mod of the classic game "Half-Life" but was later bought by Valve and turned into a real game marketed and sold in retail stores. It is commonly referred to today as one of the best video game mods ever made. The newest game in the series "Counter Strike: Global Offensive" is currently the most played game on Steam Gaming Community and is still climbing after over four years on the market.

"Counter-Strike" is a first person shooter in which players can go online and play against each other. There are six types of modes in the current Counter-Strike game.
