Ariwara no Narihira

Ariwara no Narihira (, 825 - 9 July 880) was a Japanese poet and noble. He was the fifth son of Prince Abo, a son of Emperor Heizei. His mother Princess Ito was a daughter of Emperor Kammu, so he was family to Emperor Kammu by both his mother and father. Along with his other brothers, he was forced to have a civilian life and did not live in the Imperial Court, getting a new clan name, Ariwara.
