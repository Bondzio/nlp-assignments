Awa Province (Chiba)

The province was on the tip of the Boso Peninsula (房総半島). 

Awa Province was created during the reign of Empress Genshō. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Awa Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Awa jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Awa.
