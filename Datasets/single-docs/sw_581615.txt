Faisal Abedin Deepan

Faisal Abedin Deepan (Bengali: ফয়সাল আরেফিন দীপন)(c. 1972 - October 31, 2015) was a Bangladeshi book publisher of the Jagriti Prokashoni publishing house. He was hacked to death inside his house in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. He published books by Bangladeshi-American writer and blogger Avijit Roy who was the four secular bloggers killed in Bangladesh the same year. Dipan's father said his company had published Avajit Roy's 2014 book, Biswasher Virus (The Virus of Faith).

An hour earlier, another publisher and two writers were attacked, but they survived. A local al-Qaeda group said they were responsible for the attack.
