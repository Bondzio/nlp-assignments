Survivor Series (1997)

Survivor Series (1997) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on November 9, 1997 at Molson Centre in Montreal, Quebec. It was the eleventh Survivor Series event held by the WWF.

The main event was shrouded in controversy after a real life event happened which was later dubbed the "Montreal Screwjob". Vince McMahon ordered the referee Earl Hebner to end the match when Shawn Michaels held Bret Hart in Hart's own finishing maneuver, the Sharpshooter, even though Hart did not submit.
