Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin

Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin (also known as Winnie the Pooh's Most Grand Adventure in some countries) is a 1997 direct-to-video animated movie. It is a sequel to Walt Disney's "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh". 

The movie follows Pooh and his friends on a trip to find and rescue their friend Christopher Robin from the "Skull". This movie is a new story. It is not based on any of A. A. Milne's Pooh stories.

Because of the movie's dark themes and pictures, it had mixed to negative reviews. It was the first Disney direct-to-video movie. It is also the first Winnie the Pooh movie ever to have its own special edition.

"Forever and Ever" was later sung by Carly Simon for "Piglet's Big Movie".
