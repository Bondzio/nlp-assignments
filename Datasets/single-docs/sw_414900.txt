Dauberval

Jean Bercher (known as Dauberval or D'Auberval; Montpellier, August 19, 1742 - Tours, February 14, 1802) was a French ballet dancer and choreographer. He was a pupil of Jean-Georges Noverre and made his debut at the Paris Opéra on June 12, 1762. He was a superb mime. He choreographed few ballets, but is credited with creating the comedy ballet. His best known work is "La Fille mal gardée", which is one of the oldest ballets still performed.
