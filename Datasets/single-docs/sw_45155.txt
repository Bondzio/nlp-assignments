Onion

Onions are vegetables. They are plants in the genus "Allium". When people talk about onions, they usually mean "garden onions". Onions have bulbs, which are edible, in most species. They have a strong flavour, and a very distinctive smell. 

Onions have been grown for a very long time. They were probably first grown in Ancient Egypt, together with leek and garlic, but maybe earlier. Now, most of the world's cultures eat onions.

Farmers and gardeners can grow onions from seeds or from bulbs. If they plant seeds, they must later pull out most of the young plants so the rest can grow better. This is called 'thinning.'
Or, they can plant young bulbs. This is faster, but the onions that grow this way are weaker than the onions that started as seeds.

Onions can be eaten in different ways. Fried onions are often served with hot dogs. Pickled onions are eaten with chips or with salad. Raw onions are sliced (cut into flat layers) for hamburgers. Chopped onions are put in many stews and curries. Onions are sometimes roasted whole.

When you cut an onion, you open some cells of the onion. Then, some chemicals react. When one chemical floats through the air and reaches your eyes, they sting.
There are ways to keep the chemical away. You can:ã€€
