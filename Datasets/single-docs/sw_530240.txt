Stop the War Coalition

The Stop the War Coalition (StWC; informally Stop the War) is a British group created on 21 September 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks. It was created to campaign against what it believes are unjust wars.

The group has campaigned against the wars that are part of the "War on Terror" of the United States and its allies. It has campaigned against the war in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. The demonstration against the Iraq War on 15 February 2003 was organised with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB). It is claimed to be the largest public demonstration in British history.
