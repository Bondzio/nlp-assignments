The Lone Gunmen (TV series)

The Lone Gunmen was a short-lived television show based on the show "The X-Files". It focused on the three geeks that occasionally helped Agents Mulder and Scully. Their names were John Byers, played by Bruce Harwood, Ringo Langly, played by Dean Haglund, and Melvin Frohike, played by Tom Braidwood (who used to work behind the scenes on "The X-Files" until he was talked into taking the part of Frohike). 

The series expanded the line-up to include a character named Jimmy Bond, played by Stephen Snedden, and Yves Adele Harlow, played by Zuleikha Robinson.

It is best known for predicting the events of 9/11 in its first episode.
