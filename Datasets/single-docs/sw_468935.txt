West Vancouver

West Vancouver is a district municipality in the province of British Columbia, Canada. It is part of Metro Vancouver, which is the governing body of the Greater Vancouver Regional District. West Vancouver is northwest of the city of Vancouver, with English Bay to the south and Howe Sound to the northwest.

West Vancouver had a population of 46,694 people according to the 2011 census. Some events of the 2010 Winter Olympics were held at the Cypress Provincial Park, which is mostly within the municipal bounderies. The Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal, which ferries British Columbia Highway 1 to Vancouver Island, is also located in West Vancouver.

West Vancouver was founded in 1912, when it separated from the District of North Vancouver, which is just to its east. Along with the City of North Vancouver, these three municipalities are often called the "North Shore".
