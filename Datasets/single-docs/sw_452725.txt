United Kingdom general election, 2015

The United Kingdom general election of 2015 elected the 56th Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was held on 7 May 2015. The three main political parties after the election are the Conservatives, the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party. The Conservative Party won enough seats to form the government.

Voting took place in all 650 parliamentary constituencies of the United Kingdom, each electing one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. Local elections also took place in most of England on the same day, but not Greater London.


Also, the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, who does not have a political party, was re-elected.

Some important Labour MPs lost their seats including the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and the leader of the Scottish Labour party Jim Murphy.

Many important Liberal Democrat MPs who had served in the coalition government also lost their seats, including business secretary Vince Cable, energy secretary Ed Davey and chief secretary to the treasury Danny Alexander.

The Conservative party gained 330 seats and managed to form a majority government and David Cameron continues as the Prime Minister. Miliband, Clegg and Nigel Farage all resigned as leaders of their parties. Jim Murphy also resigned as leader of Scottish Labour.
