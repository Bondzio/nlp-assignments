Aisha

Aisha bint Abu Bakr (604-678; ) was the third wife of Prophet Muhammad. Aisha is given honour in Islam, especially in the Sunni branch. She is often called by Muslims "Umm-al-mu'minin" which means "the Mother of the Believers".

Aisha was the daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Aisha was six or seven years old when she was betrothed to Muhammad. (Marriage under the age of 21 was common at the time worldwide) She was not Muhammad's only wife. The reason for her young age may have been to make sure she was a virgin.

Her ten-year marriage to Muhammad ended when he died. Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning the Quran, and the Sunnah of Muhammad.
