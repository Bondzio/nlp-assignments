Handshaking (computing)

Handshaking is the establishment of a connection between the computer and a peripheral device, such as a mouse or a keyboard. When the computer requests an action from a peripheral device, such as a printer, it "asks" the peripheral device to do something, and then gives a connection with each other. In the case of the printer, once the computer gains connection with the printer ("handshakes"), the printer will print out the file from the computer.
