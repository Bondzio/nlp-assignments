Tsugaru Strait

A warm current ("Tsushima-kairyū") runs through the straight from south to north.

The Seikan Tunnel passes under the strait at its narrowest point. This is between Tappi Misaki on the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori in Honshū and Shirakami Misaki on the Matsumae Peninsula in Hokkaidō.

In the past, the most common way for passengers and freight to cross the strait was on a ferry. This was about a four-hour journey.
