Environmental migration

Environmental migration is a form of migration which happens because the environment changes where people live. These changes can be sudden (such as floods, droughts, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions), or they can happen over longer periods of time. An example of changes that occur only slowly are those of desertification or the rise of the sea level.
