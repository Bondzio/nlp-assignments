Pop (television channel)

Pop is a UK children's channel that airs many childrenâ€™s cartoons. It has won a lot of awards and prizes.

Pop was called "Toons & Tunes" sometime before 2003, but in June 2003, it changed its name to "Pop". At first it was just music videos but in early 2004 it started to show cartoons. These include things like Archie's Weird Mysteries, The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 etc.; The music videos were kept but all disappeared in mid 2006. They were brought back in 2007 but only during a slot called "Pop Party". Also changes have been made to the logo throughout the years. To start with, it showed letters being replaced by balloons, it was all in lower case, and it had no exclamation mark but in October 2006, a change was made. It was now white letters on an orange background. They were in 3D now. The exclamation mark was added and the letters were now all done in upper case. Due to copyright reasons on the music that got changed in 2007. In 2008 Pop's logo yet again changed. It used to be coloured letters on a blue background but the background disappeared and the letters were now all red. This is its current logo but the old one is still on the pop website.

Not long after the launch of Tiny pop's website, Pop had its own channel launched too. It features a fun and games bit, a what's on bit, a competitions page, and the logo. The games are things like Oggy Moshi, and things like that.
