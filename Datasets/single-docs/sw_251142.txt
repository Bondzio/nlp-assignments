Fabrosaurus

Fabrosaurus was a small, early, plant-eating dinosaur that lived in Africa during the Lower Jurassic, roughly 199 to 189 million years ago (mya). Very little is known about "Fabrosaurus" since only a portion of a jaw has been found. "Fabrosaurus" is a dubious genus; it may be the same dinosaur as "Lesothosaurus".
