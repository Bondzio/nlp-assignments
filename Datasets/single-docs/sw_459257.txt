Murphy was a quadriplegic (handicapped) after a diving accident that took place at Martha's Vineyard in 1974. His friend and director, Peter Farrelly, was with him at the accident.

Murphy criticized Farrelly for not including handicapped people in his movie "Dumb & Dumber". This lead to Murphy's first movie role in Farrelly's comedy movie "Kingpin". 

Murphy died in Florida from cancer, aged 58.
