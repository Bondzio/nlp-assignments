Hindkowan

Hindkowans is a general term used to identify speakers of the Hindko dialect of North Punjabi (claimed to be a separate language, according to some people) within Pakistan. In fact this is not an ethnic grouping or category properly speaking, and comprises diverse elements in the Punjab, and small amount in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and in Mianwali District and Dera Ghazi Khan areas of Punjab (Pakistan). 
However, over time, this linguistic category or grouping has come to be linked to various indigenous regional demands and aspirations and is now thought to be an ethnic group in itself.
