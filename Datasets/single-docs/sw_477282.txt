Jean-Claude Baker

Jean-Claude Baker (born Jean-Claude Julien Léon Tronville, April 18, 1943 – January 15, 2015) was a French-American restaurateur. He was born in Dijon, France. 

He met U.S.-born French entertainer Josephine Baker while he was working as a bellhop in Paris at the age of fourteen in 1958. He became the last of twelve children adopted into Baker's Rainbow Family. In 1994 he co-authored a biography of Josephine Baker, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart", described as a "shocking look into the star's seriously whitewashed past".

Baker was found dead at his home in East Hampton, New York on January 15, 2015, of an apparent suicide. He was 71.
