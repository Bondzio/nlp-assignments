Exodus International

Exodus International was a non profit and ex-gay Christian group seeking to limit homosexual desire. The group was based in Orlando, Florida. They did not perform or conduct clinical treatment, although it does have a position saying that holistic counseling approaches that can address homosexual behaviors may be beneficial. The techniques involved are abstinence, lessening of homosexual temptations and correcting distorted style of relations to the same or opposite gender. This organization was founded around 1976. It represented over 120 local ministry networks in the United States and Canada and over 150 in another 17 countries. It was closed in 2013.
