Supreme Court of Pakistan

The Supreme Court () (abbreviated as the SCP) is the apex court in Pakistan's judicial hierarchy, the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes. 

The Supreme Court has a permanent seat in Islamabad. It also has a number of Branch Registries in 4-5 major cities where cases are heard. It has a number of de jure powers which are outlined in the Constitution. Through several periods of military rule and constitutional suspensions, the court has also established itself as a "de facto" check on military power. 

In addition, it has also been active as a 'watchdog' in checking political corruption and abuse of power in recent times.
