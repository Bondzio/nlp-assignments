Carlo Maderno

Carlo Maderno (1556 - January 30, 1629) was an Italian-Swiss architect, born in Ticino. He is remembered as one of the fathers of Baroque architecture. His fa√ßades of Santa Susanna, St. Peter's Basilica and Sant'Andrea della Valle were important in the evolution of the Italian Baroque. He is often referred to as the brother of sculptor Stefano Maderno, but this is not universally agreed upon.
