Pat Quinn (politician)

Patrick Joseph "Pat" Quinn III (born December 16, 1948), is an American politician. He was the Governor of Illinois from 2009 to 2015. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He was Lieutenant Governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2009. He lost re-election in 2014 to Bruce Rauner.

Quinn was born on December 16, 1948 in Hinsdale, Illinois. He is of Irish descent. He studied at Georgetown University and at Northwestern University. 

He became Governor on January 29, 2009 when Rod Blagojevich, the state's earlier Governor, was impeached and thrown out of office. He praised the Illinois General Assembly for Blagojevich's impeachment.

He was elected into office during the 2010 gubernatorial election. He defeated Republican Bill Brady.

As governor he faced severe short-term budget shortfalls and a long-term state debt, all in the context of the worst national economic slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 

Quinn has pushed for spending cuts and tax increases, while trying to raise ethical standards, protect public-sector labor unions, and maintain environmental standards.

In November 2014, Quinn lost his re-election campaign to Republican Bruce Rauner.

Quinn is divorced and has two sons, Patrick IV and David, born on April 12, 1983, and December 16, 1984, respectively. Quinn was briefly a practicing tax attorney before his career in public office.
