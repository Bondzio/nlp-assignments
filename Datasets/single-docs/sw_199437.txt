Bubble wrap

Bubble wrap is a kind of packaging. It is made of two very thin pieces of plastic stuck together with small round air bubbles stuck inside. When these bubble are compressed and punctured, they make a popping sound. They are commonly used as stress relievers. They are also used in packaging sensitive things that can be broken. It was invented by accident in 1957 by Alfred Fielding.
