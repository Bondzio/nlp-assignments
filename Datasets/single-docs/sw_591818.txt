Curaçao national football team

The Curaçao national football team is the football team that represents Curaçao. This is not to be confused with the Territory of Curaçao national football team, which existed until 1954 when Curaçao merged into the Netherlands Antilles national football team. The Netherlands Antilles dissolved into different countries on 10 October 2010. The Curaçao national football team is seen as the official successor of the Netherlands Antilles national team.

The team's first match as a new country was played on 18 August 2011 against the Dominican Republic.
