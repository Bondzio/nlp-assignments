Associated Press

The Associated Press (also called the AP and AP Wire) is an American non-profit news media company. 
It is based in New York City. The AP is a non-profit cooperative owned by the newspapers, radio and Television stations who share its news stories. Most articles are written by staff members belonging to the Newspaper Guild Union, a part of the AFL-CIO. Many news organizations outside pay a fee to use the stories without being members. 

In 2013 it was revealed that the United States Department of Justice had secretly obtained telephone records belonging to AP a few months before the United States presidential election, 2012. Associated Press CEO Gary Pruitt called the DOJ action: a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' of Freedom of the Press rights, according to Fox News. Head of the Department of Justice Eric Holder, who has been asked for his resignation over the matter, claimed that he was not involved.
