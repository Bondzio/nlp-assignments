Samaná English

Samaná English is a variety of the English language. It is spoken by about 8,000 people in the Samaná Peninsula, Dominican Republic. The speakers of Samaná English are the descendants of African American slaves freed from the United States. They migrated to the Samaná region beginning in 1824.
