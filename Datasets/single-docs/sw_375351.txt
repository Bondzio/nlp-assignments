Kia Tigers

The Kia Tigers is a professional baseball team in Korea. The team started in 1982 with the name of Haitai Tigers. Haitai sold the team to Kia in 2001. They won the Korean Series 9 times as Haitai Tigers (1983, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1996, 1997). They won again in 2009. Winning 10 times is the top record among all Korean baseball teams. They never lost the Korean Series so far.

Their main stadium is Mudeung Baseball Stadium in Gwangju.

The Haitai Tigers was the third professional baseball team in Korea, following OB Bears (currently Doosan Bears) and MBC Blue Dragons (currently LG Twins). It started on January 30, 1982 with only 14 players and the manager. In 1983, the team hired Kim Eung-ryong as manager and they won the Korean Series for the first time.

After the team signed Sun Dong-yeol in 1985, the Haitai Tigers Dynasty started. They won the Korean Series for 4 straight years (1986-1989). Another superstar, Lee Jong-beom, made his debut in 1993. He won the Korean Series MVP in his debut season. From 1982 to 1997, the team won the Korean Series 9 times.

Because of the financial problem of Haitai company, the team started to sell many good players including Lee Jong-beom and Lim Chang-yong. 

Kia took over the baseball team and the name was changed to Kia Tigers. Lee Jong-beom returned from Japan and he was retired in 2012. In 2005, the Kia Tigers ended the season in the lowest place for the first time ever. However, in 2009, the team won the Korean Series with Na Ji-wan's dramatic walk-off home-run in the last game. It was the first victory after 1997 and as Kia Tigers. Since 2012, Sun Dong-yeol, the legendary superstar in Tigers, has become the manager of the team.
