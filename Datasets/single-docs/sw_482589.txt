It Gets Better Project

The It Gets Better Project is a non-profit organization that reaches out to LGBT youths who feel depressed or suicidal. Contributors to the project submit videos, essays, and other media. These are to share their stories, experiences, and messages telling LGBT youth that their lives will get better over time. The It Gets Better Project shows LGBT youth that they was not alone in their experiences. It shows they have people to turn to for support. The project was created by Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller in 2010. It includes submissions by US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
