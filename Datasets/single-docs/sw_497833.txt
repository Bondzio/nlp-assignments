Film critic Roger Ebert reviewed the film ("Chicago Sun Times", 24 December 1968). He wrote: ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" contains about the best two-hour children's movie you could hope for, with a marvelous magical auto and lots of adventure and a nutty old grandpa and a mean Baron and some funny dances and a couple of [scary] moments."

Film critic and historian Leonard Maltin considered the picture "one big Edsel. He said the movie had a totally forgettable score and some of the shoddiest special effects ever." In 2008, "Entertainment Weekly" called Helpmann's depiction of the Child Catcher one of the "50 Most Vile Movie Villains."

As of March 2014, the film has a 65% "Fresh" rating (17 of 26 reviews) on Rotten Tomatoes.
