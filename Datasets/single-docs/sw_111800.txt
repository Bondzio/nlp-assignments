Governor of Florida

The head of the government of the state of Florida is called the Governor of Florida. He is not the head of all parts of the government, but is like the state's president, and is head of the "executive branch" of the state, which is where decisions about running the state are made. He can also give orders to the military people of the state.

The Governor of Florida is elected every four years.

The territory of Florida was transferred from Spain to the United States on July 10 1821. Before that, governors were assigned by the government of Spain.

No governors were elected between 1821 until 1845. During that period, there were five military governors: William Duval (April 17 1822 - April 24 1834), John Eaton (April 24 1834 - March 16 1836), Richard Call (March 16 1836 - December 2 1839), Robert R. Reid (December 2 1839 - March 19 1841), Richard Call (his 2nd time) (March 19 1841 - August 11 1844), and John Branch (August 11 1844 - June 25 1845).

Florida acceded to statehood on March 3 1845. These are the governors of the State of Florida:
