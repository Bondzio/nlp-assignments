There are also many hidden characters to be unlocked dubbed "Secret Characters" by the official Super Smash Bros. Website.

The Wii U version has high-definition graphics. The Nintendo 3DS version has cel-shaded (computer graphics made to look like they were drawn by hand) graphics. Both versions have the same number of characters, but have stages that are only in either version. The Nintendo 3DS version has more stages based on Nintendo's handheld video games. The Wii U version has more stages based on their console video games. For the first time in the series, players can change the movesets of characters. They can play with characters they have changed the movesets of in single-player and with friends.

Mewtwo, who had last appeared in "Melee", was released on April 28, 2015 and was made available on April 15, 2015 for members of Club Nintendo who had purchased and registered both 3DS and Wii U versions of the game before March 31, 2015.
