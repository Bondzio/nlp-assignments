Arena Football League

The Arena Football League (or AFL) is an American football league in the United States that ran from 1987 to 2008, but has since then came back in 2010. After it ended, another league like it started in 2010, called Arena Football 1. Some, but not all, of the AFL teams joined Arena Football 1. The league later changed its name to the Arena Football League. There'll be 5 teams in 2017.

Unlike what people in this league call the outdoor league (the NFL), "Arena football" is played in an smaller arena. Arena Football is played with only 8 players on a team, not 11 like the NFL.

The Arena Football League has had many teams join and leave the league. Every year, there has been at least one team which did not play with the same name as the year before.
