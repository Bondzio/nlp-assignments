Rumble Fighter

Rumble Fighter is a computer game. It is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) where it is possible to play different classes such as the Striker, Soul Fighter, Elementalist, Alchemist or Shaman. The game is usually played player vs. player (PVP), but a new mode called Adventure Mode makes it possible to fight monsters, single play or party play.
