Shah Puri dialect

Its name is derived from former Shahpur District (now Shahpur Tehsil, part of Sargodha District). It is also called Western Punjabi. 

This dialect has great proximity with Majhi Dialect of Punjabi Language. It can be described as a mixture of Majhi, Pothohari and thalochi dialects. Shahpurias in the Khushab area speak this dialect in a more Thalochi tone while those in southern parts of its distribution have color of Jhangochi on their language.

This entire area has almost the same traditions, customs and culture. The Shahpuri dialect of Punjabi has several aspects that set it apart from other Punjabi variants.
