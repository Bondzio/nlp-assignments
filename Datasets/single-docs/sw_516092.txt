Cecilia (Simon &amp; Garfunkel song)

"Cecilia" is a song by American folk rock duo, singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. The song was released in April 1970 as the third single from the group's fifth studio album, "Bridge over Troubled Water" (1970). The song was written by Paul Simon. the song's origins lie in a late-night party. They got the rhythm when the duo and friends began slapping their thighs and drumming on a piano bench. They recorded the sound with a tape recorder, employing reverb and matching the rhythm created by the machine. Simon later wrote the song's guitar line and lyrics on the subject of an untrustworthy lover. Simon didn't remember what inspired him but he remembered Cecilia was the goddess of music.

The song was a hit single in the United States, peaking at number four on the "Billboard" Hot 100. On the "Cash Box" Top 100, it reached number one.

"Cecilia" also did well in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, where it reached number two, and also in Switzerland and Belgium, where it peaked at number three. The song has been the subject of numerous cover versions, most notably by the singer Suggs, whose version featured the ragga duo, Louchie Lou & Michie One and reached number four in the United Kingdom in 1996. In Malawi the song is banned. The president of the country thought the song was offensive to his official hostess, Cecilia Tamanda Kadzamira. 

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart<br>
You're shaking my confidence daily<br>
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees<br>
I'm begging you please to come home<br>

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart<br>
You're shaking my confidence daily<br>
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees<br>
I'm begging you please to come home<br>
Come on home<br>

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia<br>
Up in my bedroom (making love)<br>
I got up to wash my face<br>
When I come back to bed someone's taken my place<br>

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart<br>
You're shaking my confidence daily<br>
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees<br>
I'm begging you please to come home<br>
Come on home<br>
