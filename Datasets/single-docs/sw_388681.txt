Division of West Sydney

The Division of West Sydney was an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was one of the original 75 divisions created in 1900 for the first federal election in 1901. It was abolished in 1968. It covered the inner western suburbs of Sydney, and at various times included the suburbs of Pyrmont, Darling Harbour, Surry Hills, Balmain and Glebe.

It was the first of four seats to be held by Billy Hughes, the 11th Prime Minister of Australia and the longest-serving member of the Australian Parliament. It was also held by T. J. Ryan, a former Premier of Queensland.
