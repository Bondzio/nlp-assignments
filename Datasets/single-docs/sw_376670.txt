Play-Doh

Play-Doh is a children's modeling compound. It is made of flour, water, salt, boric acid, and mineral oil. It was first manufactured in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., as a wallpaper cleaner in the 1930s. Children began using the wallpaper cleaner as a modeling compound. The product was reworked and marketed to schools in the middle 1950s. Play-Doh was introduced at an educational convention in 1956. Important department stores opened retail accounts. Advertisements on many children's television shows in 1957 brought more sales. Play-Doh has much spinoff merchandise such as The Fun Factory. In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Play-Doh in its "Century of Toys List".
