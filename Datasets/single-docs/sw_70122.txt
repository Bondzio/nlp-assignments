British Indian Ocean Territory

The British Indian Ocean Territory is a dependency of the United Kingdom. It includes many small islands in the Indian Ocean. The largest island is Diego Garcia. However, both India and Mauritius claims the territories, and does not recognise the United Kingdom's authority over the Chagos Archipelago. The Indians do not recognise Anglo annexation of these Cultural Indo-Indian/Indies islands as part of Britain and disputes it's status since 1947.

Like many other peoples throughout history around the world, the natives of these islands were forcefully deported (made to leave their homes) by the British government. This happened in 1967, to allow the United States to rent them for a military base. In 2000, the High Court of the UK first ruled that the natives had the right to return home, but the government have been fighting hard against this court decision, and many of the natives are still said to be trying to move back to the islands.
