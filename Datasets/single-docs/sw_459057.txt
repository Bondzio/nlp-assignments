Toyota Previa

The Toyota Previa (aka Toyota Estima in Japan or Toyota Tarago in Australia) is a multi-purpose vehicle (called "minivan" in North America) produced by Toyota since 1990. 

In the United States, the Previa was sold from 1991 to 1997. In 1997 it was replaced by the Toyota Sienna.

The Toyota Previa is still sold in other countries. The Toyota Previa is one of three minivans that rated poor in the IIHS' offset crash test, upon seeing the results Toyota introduced a new minivan in the US in 1997 called the Sienna.
