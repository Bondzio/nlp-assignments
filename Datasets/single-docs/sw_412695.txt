Transfiguration

The Transfiguration is an event in the life of Jesus Christ described in the Gospel of Luke, Gospel of Matthew, and Gospel of Mark. The disciples go up a mountain with Jesus. He begins to shine, and meets with Moses and Elijah. A voice from a cloud says, "this is my beloved Son: hear him" (Luke 9:35).
