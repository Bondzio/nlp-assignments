Toontown Online

Toontown Online (also known as Toontown) is a online video game created by The Walt Disney Company. The game is an MMORPG, where a lot of people play at one time. It was released in 2003, and closed in 2013.

Players live life as a toon in Toontown. Players can make a duck, bear, mouse, rabbit, dog, cat, horse, pig, or monkey.

Players try to live life as a toon, playing games on the Trolley and making new friends. But it's not all paradise. Evil robots called Cogs have taken over, and "gags" (cartoon fun) are used to defeat them. There is not a purpose that players have to go by. A player can choose to be the top racer or to have the most "laffpoints". Many people like it because of this. Some users even dare to become mighty "ubers", toons with better gags but poor "laff".
