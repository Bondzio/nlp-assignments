Everest Base Camp

Everest Base Camp is a campsite at the bottom of Mount Everest. There are two of them, located on opposite sides of the mountain. They are used as bases by mountain climbers. The climbers usually rest at base camp for several days to acclimatise. This lowers the risks and severity of altitude sickness. Climbing starts from one of these two camps.

Food and equipment are brought to the South Base Camp by sherpas or porters, with the help of animals like yaks. The North Base Camp has a track that vehicles can access, but usually only during summer.
