Rob Gonsalves

Rob Gonsalves (born in 1959 in Toronto) is a Canadian painter of magic and surreal events.

Gonsalves's art was not recognized until several years after he started, in the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibit. He was given a small spot there to show off his most recent art. During the exhibit, he received a large amount of encouragement.

Gonsalves currently sells his latest work at exhibits and multiple websites. His most visited exhibits include the Art Expo in New York and Los Angeles, Decor Atlanta and Las Vegas, Fine Art Forum, as well as one-man shows at Discovery Galleries, Ltd., Marcus Ashley Gallery, and the Hudson River Art Gallery.

In June 2003, Simon & Schuster produced Gonsalves's first book, "Imagine a Night". A second book, "Imagine a Day", was produced in 2004. That book received the 2005 Governor General's Award. In 2008, Gonsalves produced another book, "Imagine a Place".
