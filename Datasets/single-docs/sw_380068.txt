The band was formed in 1990 by rapper Ice-T and some of his friends. They released their self-titled debut album, "Body Count", on March 31, 1992. The album featured the controversial song "Cop Killer".

Band member Beatmaster V died in died of leukemia in 1996, Mooseman was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2001 and D-Roc the Executioner died in 2004 from lymphoma.

Their debut album featured the controversial song "Cop Killer" which received negative reactions from political figures like then-President George H.W. Bush, then-Vice President Dan Quayle and Tipper Gore, co-founder of Parents Music Resource Center. Ice-T decided to re-release the album with the song "Cop Killer" on it saying "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record but the cops that are out there killing people."
