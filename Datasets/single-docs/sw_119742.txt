Dennis Green

Dennis "Denny" Green (February 17, 1949 â€“ July 22, 2016) was a head coach for the Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals, in the National Football League. He also coached college football for Northwestern University and Stanford University. He was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

After the Cardinals' loss to the Chicago Bears in 2006, Green erupted in an angry interview, because the Cardinals were winning by 20 points first, but then the Bears came back and won, with the Cardinals kicker Neil Rackers missing the game-winning field goal.

Green died suddenly of a massive heart attack in Minneapolis, Minnesota on July 22, 2016, aged 67.
