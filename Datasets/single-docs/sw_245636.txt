Captain (association football)

The team captain of a football team is a team member who is chosen to be the leader during a football match. Mostly a captain is an older or more experienced player. A team captain often wears an armband.

The captain has to participate in the coin toss before the match and before a penalty shootout. Referees mostly talk to the captain about the behaviour of him and his team mates. When the team wins a trophy it is given to the captain.
