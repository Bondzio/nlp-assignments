James Baldwin

James Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 â€“ December 1, 1987) was an American novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, and social critic.

Baldwin's essays, such as the collection "Notes of a Native Son" (1955), explore racial, sexual, and class matters in Western societies, most notably in mid-20th-century America, and their inevitable if unnamable tensions with personal identity, something taken for granted, uncertainties, yearning, and questing.

Baldwin was born on August 2, 1924 in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. He studied at DeWitt Clinton High School and at The New School. Baldwin was gay. He married and had no children. Baldwin died on December 1, 1987 in Saint-Paul de Vence, France from esophageal cancer, aged 63.
