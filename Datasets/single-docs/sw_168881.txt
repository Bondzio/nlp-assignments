Dadaism

Dadaism is an artistic movement in modern art that started around World War I. Its purpose was to ridicule (poke fun at) the supposed meaninglessness of the modern world. Its peak was 1916 to 1922, and it influenced surrealism, pop art, and punk rock. It favored going against normal social actions.
Followers of Dadaism included Antonin Artaud, Max Ernst, and Salvador Dali. A later version, called "Neo-Dada", arose in the 1960s.

Dadaism is also closely associated with the concepts of the grotesque, the absurd and the macabre that were communicated through the arts slightly later in the twentieth century. The idea of ridiculing the absurdity of existence finds its most poignant expression through the dramatic art of Samuel Beckett and the so called Paris school of dramatists that included Arthur Adamov, Jean Genet, and Eugene O'Neill.
