Jawaharlal Nehru

Jawaharlal Nehru (also referred to as "Pandit Nehru") (November 14 1889 - May 27 1964) was the leader (prime minister) of India for 17 years immediately after 1947, when India became independent. He was born in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. He died of a heart attack in New Delhi.

Nehru was the first post British independence prime minister.

Under British rule, Nehru was jailed many times. During these periods, he used to write long letters to his daughter, Indira, on Indian and World history. These letters were remarkably well written and became very successful books when published later as "Glimpses of World History" and "The discovery of India".

His father Motilal Nehru, was also an important figure in the Indian freedom struggle, and his daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi went on to become prime ministers of India.
