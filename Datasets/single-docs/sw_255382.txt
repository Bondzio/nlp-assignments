Honda Racing F1

Honda Racing F1, was a Formula One motor racing team and constructor. Honda F1 originally started in 1964 and were in F1 until 1968 when after the death of one of their drivers, Honda decided to leave Formula 1. Then, in 2006 Honda bought British American Racing to who it already supplied Honda engines. With the partnership of former Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello and former BAR driver Jenson Button, the 'new' Honda F1 team won its first, and only, race in 2006 when Jenson Button won the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. Then in 2008 due to the recession, Honda announced they would leave F1. Not too long after, Ross Brawn bought out the team and renamed it Brawn GP, and ran the team in the 2009 season.
