Chill-out music

Chill-out music began in Europe during the early-1990s. 

It is an umbrella term for different types of electronic music that are meant to have a mellow style as well as mid-tempo beats. Ambient, ambient house, trip-hop, nu jazz, New Age and some other sub-genres of downtempo are mainly associated with chill-out music.

The music genre is played in "chill rooms" at dance clubs to allow dancers a chance to "chill out" from the more vigorous and fast-tempo type of music that is played on the main dance floor. In 1992, a UK regulation required dance clubs to have chill-out rooms and free water because of a number of Ecstasy-related injuries and deaths.
