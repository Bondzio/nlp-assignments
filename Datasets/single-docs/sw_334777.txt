Hostel: Part II

Hostel: Part II is an American horror drama of 2007. It is the sequel to the original "Hostel" and set in Slovakia like its predecessor. This horror drama performed slightly poor. It was restricted to adults in certain countries: in particular, New Zealand banned "Hostel: Part II" after its distributor would not remove the scene in which Lorna is in torture, though an edited version was released onto DVD in 2008.
