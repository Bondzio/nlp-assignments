20000 Varuna

20000 Varuna is a big Kuiper belt object (KBO) and could be a dwarf planet. Before it was named Varuna, it had the provisional designation .

Varuna is named after the Hindu deity Varuṇa.
Varuna completes one rotation in about 3.17 hours (or 6.34 hours, depending on whether the light curve is single or double-peaked). Given the fast rotation, which is not common for objects so big, Varuna is thought to be a stretched spheroid, with a density around 1g/cm³ (close to the density of water). 

The surface of Varuna is somewhat red and small amounts of water ice have been found on its surface.
