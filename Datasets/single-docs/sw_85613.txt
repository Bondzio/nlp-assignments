Nashville Sounds

The Nashville Sounds are a minor league baseball team from Nashville, Tennessee. They play at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the Pacific Coast League (a group of 16 baseball teams at the same level). When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he is moved up to the team's partner, the Oakland Athletics, which is a Major League Baseball team. 

The Sounds played from 1978 to 2014 at Herschel Greer Stadium (the name of the stadium where they played baseball). In 2015, the Sounds began to play at a new stadium called First Tennessee Park. They have won the championship in their league three (3) times: 1979, 1982, and 2005.

The team is named "Sounds" because Nashville, the city where the team plays, is famous for making Country music.

The Sounds' first ballpark was Herschel Greer Stadium. They played baseball games their from 1978 to 2014. There were many changes to the ballpark since it was completed in 1978. It has seats for 10,300 spectators. Its best known feature is its giant 115.6 foot (35.2 m) scoreboard which is behind the left field wall. It has the shape of a guitar. After the construction of new and quite luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer had fallen below standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. Therefore, there were several renovations and upgrades to meet the Triple-A standards.

In 2014, the Sounds and the Nashville Metro Government agreed on a plan to build a new baseball stadium for the team. The Sounds began playing baseball at the new stadium, called First Tennessee Park, in 2015. It has space for 10,000 spectators. There are 8,500 seats, and there is a spot of grass where 1,500 others can sit.
