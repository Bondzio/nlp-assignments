Paleoanthropology

Paleoanthropology (or palaeoanthropology) combines the study of paleontology and physical anthropology. It is the study of human evolution. 

The subject is also closely connected to archaeology. The evidence of tool-making and other activities shows the subtle but important changes in thinking that early humans went through.
