Alvin Plantinga

Alvin Plantinga (born November 15, 1932, Ann Arbor, Michigan ) is an American epistemologist, philosopher of religion and professor at the University of Notre Dame. He is a founding member of the Society of Christian Philosophers.

Plantinga's aim in philosophy is to defend believing in God as rational. His epistemology is one that tries to say that knowledge is only possible if you accept the possibility of some form of intelligent design by God.
