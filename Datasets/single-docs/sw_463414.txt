Sacrifice (2011)

Sacrifice (2011) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on May 15, 2011 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the seventh Sacrifice event that TNA held.

There were nine matches on the card. The main event saw Sting defeat Rob Van Dam to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. 

Sacrifice gained mixed reviews. James Caldwell of Pro Wrestling Torch thought that the show had an "Awful undercard and decent-to-acceptable second-half of the card". He said that "Overall, TNA was missing a match like Steiner vs. Morgan, which they began hyping at the first set of TV tapings, to better bridge the middle of the show to the main event matches. Instead, the show had too many matches the crowd had no emotional investment in."
