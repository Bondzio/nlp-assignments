Goryōkaku

"Goryōkaku" was designed in 1855 by Takeda Hisaburō. His plan was based on the work of the French architect Vauban. The fort is shaped like a five-pointed star. This allowed for greater numbers of gun emplacements on its walls than a traditional Japanese fortress, and reduced the number of blind spots where a cannon could not fire.

The fort was built by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the Tsugaru Strait against a possible invasion by the Russian fleet. 

Goryōkaku is famous as the site of the last battle of the Boshin War ("Goryōkaku no Tatakai"). The fighting lasted for a week (June 20-27 1869).
