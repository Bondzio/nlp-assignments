Ulster Unionist Party

The Ulster Unionist Party or UUP for short is a centre-right political party in Northern Ireland. It wants Northern Ireland to stay in the United Kingdom and is also moderately against the European Union. It has 18 out of 108 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly and 1 of 3 Northern Ireland seats in the European Parliament but has no seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. It's current leader is Tom Elliott.

During the 2010 General Election and the 2009 European Parliament Election, the party allied itself to the UK Conservative Party and called itself Ulster Conservatives and Unionists - New Force.
