David Walliams

David Edward Walliams (born Williams; 20 August 1971) is an English comedian, writer and actor, known for his partnership with Matt Lucas on the TV sketch show "Little Britain" and its predecessor "Rock Profile". More recently he and Lucas wrote and starred in "Come Fly with Me".

In September 2011, he swam the entire 140 mile length of the River Thames, raising over Â£1,000,000 for a charity called Sport Relief.

Born in the London Borough of Merton on 20 August 1971 to Peter, a London Transport engineer, and Kathleen Williams, a lab technician, Williams was brought up in Banstead. His parents appeared on "The Friday Night Project" when he was the guest star on the show. He was educated at Collingwood Boys' School in Wallington (now Collingwood School) and the independent Reigate Grammar School (where he was a contemporary of Robert Shearman). He was a member of the National Youth Theatre, where he met Matt Lucas. Williams studied drama at the University of Bristol from 1989 to 1992, one year below Simon Pegg.

Williams changed his name to Walliams () when he joined the actors' trade union, Equity, as there was already a member named David Williams. This was spoofed in a mock interview on "Rock Profile", when Robbie Williams was continuously referred to as 'Robbie Walliams'.
