Leon Czolgosz

Leon Czolgosz (May 5, 1873 - October 29, 1901) was an American assassin and an anarchist best known as the murderer of William McKinley. He was born in Alpena, Michigan to Polish Catholic immigrant parents. Czolgosz shot President William McKinley in Buffalo, New York on 6 September 1901. The President died from his injury on September 14, 1901, 8 days later. Czolgosz shot the president claiming the President committed war crimes in the American Philippines war (1899-1913) and was an enemy of the people. He was influenced by Emma Goldman. Some people have questioned the sanity of Czolgosz.

Czolgosz was found guilty of murder in a very fast trial. He was executed by electric chair in Auburn prison, New York on October 29, 1901.
