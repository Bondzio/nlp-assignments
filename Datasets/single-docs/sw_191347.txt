Lawn mower

A lawn mower (or lawnmower) is a machine that uses blades to cut a lawn. There are different types of lawn mowers. The smallest are pushed by a human, they are good for small lawns and gardens. Ride-on mowers are good for larger lawns. The largest are pulled behind a tractor, they are made for grass at places like golf courses and parks. Always wear safety equipment while working with these machines.

A lawn mower functions by spinning either a thin blade, or a small piece of cable, to cause "lacerations" on the stems of grass & other plants. Severing the plant and reducing the height of the plant to a more pleasing appearance.
