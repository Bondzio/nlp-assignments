2011 England riots

Rioting took place in several English cities, and towns, between 6 and 10 August 2011. Looting and arson also took place at this time. The riots started when a demonstration took place, on 6 August 2011, about the police's shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, North London. It turned into a riot. Over the next few days, the riots spread to other places in London and then to other areas of England. The riots caused five deaths. 186 police officers were hurt. The University of Nottingham found that British people became more racist after the riots. 

On 4 August 2011, a police officer shot and killed 29-year-old Mark Duggan during a traffic stop on the Ferry Lane bridge next to Tottenham Hale station. Friends and relatives of Duggan said that he was unarmed.

On 12 August, historian David Starkey blamed black gangster culture. He said that "whites have become black". Max Hastings of the "Daily Mail" blamed a culture of welfare dependence.
