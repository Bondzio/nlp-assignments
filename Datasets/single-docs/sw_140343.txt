Opel Zafira

Opel Zafira is a car produced by the German carmaker Opel since 1999, and is branded as Vauxhall Zafira in Great Britain. It currently in its third generation.

The Zafira is sometimes said to be the replacement of the Sintra, because it was introduced roughly around the same time it was discontinued. Also, they were both minivans. However, the Zafira was in a different segment, and Opel had not intended this.
