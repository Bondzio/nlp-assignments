Coburg Rural District

Coburg is a rural district in Upper Franconia in north Bavaria, Germany.

The history of the district is largely influenced by the city of Coburg. From 1826 to 1918, the region was part of the small duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. After World War I, the Coburg portion of this state decided to join Bavaria. The present district is identical to that portion, but excludes the city of Coburg and the exclave of Königsberg, which is part of Haßberge district. The city of Neustadt was a district-free city until 1972 and was then made part of the district.

The district is located in the hilly country between the Thuringian Slate Mountains and the Main valley.

The arms consist of the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria and the arms of the Wettin dynasty of Saxony. These arms represent the historic affiliations to both states.
