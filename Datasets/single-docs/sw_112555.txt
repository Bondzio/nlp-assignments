Deniz Gezmiş

Deniz Gezmiş (February 27, 1947 – May 6, 1972) was a political activist in the late 1960s. He is one of the founders of the Marxist-Leninist organization Türkiye Halk Kurtuluş Ordusu, in English Turkey People's Liberation Army.

Gezmis was captured by the Turkish government and the trial period started. At the end of his trial, Gezmiş was sentenced to death. He was killed on May 6, 1973, by the Turkish government. However, many people years later think Deniz Gezmis and his friends are heroes, and that they are threats to the community.

Books about Deniz Gezmis's life have been written. The latest book about his life is "Darağacında Üç Fidan". It was published in Turkish language in 2008.
