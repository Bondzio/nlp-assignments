In the movie, California Senator Jay Bulworth is losing his bid for re-election to a fiery young populist. His socialist views, formed in the 1960s and 1970s, have lost favor with voters. He has changed to more conservative politics. He also accepts donations from big corporations. Furthermore, he and his wife have been having affairs for years, with each other's knowledge.

Bulworth is tired of politics. He is also unhappy with his life in general and planning to commit suicide. He negotiates a $10 million life insurance policy with his daughter as the beneficiary. Knowing that a suicide will void his daughter's inheritance, he plans to have himself murdered in two days' time.

Bulworth turns up in California extremely drunk. He also smokes marijuana and raps in public. His frank and offensive remarks make him an instant media darling and re-energize his campaign. Along the way he becomes romantically involved with a young black activist named Nina. Nina tags along with him on his campaign stops. As the movie progresses, he gets pursued by paparazzi, his insurance company and the public.
