Parinacota Volcano

Parinacota or Parina Quta (from Aymara "parina" flamingo, "quta" lake, "flamingo lake") is a massive dormant volcano (a stratovolcano) on the border of Chile and Bolivia.

The first ascent of this peak was made by Carlos Ter√°n, Bolivian, and Joseph Prem, Austrian on 12 December 1928.

It is part of the Payachata volcanic group formed by the Parinacota together with the Pleistocene peak of Pomerape.

The volcano and Pomerape straddle the border between Sajama National Park (Oruro Department, Bolivia) and Lauca National Park (Parinacota Province, Chile).
