Corps de ballet

The corps de ballet are a group of dancers in a ballet company who are not soloists. They perform as a group {the Flowers in the "Waltz of the Flowers" from "The Nutcracker", for example) and at other times as a backdrop for the soloists (the peasants in the mad scene from "Giselle").
