Pichal Peri

Pichal Peri or Churail or Churel (Urdu:meaning, with reversed 
feet) is a sort of legendary witch or monster type creature in Central Asian and 
South Asian folklore. 

It is supposed to be very dark, ugly and scary. It is also supposed to attack and kill human beings, to eat their livers. Some people say they have seen this creature, and it has long hair and long teeth and feet that are reversed (with heel in front and toes turned back). 

However, there is no real proof this creature really exists.
