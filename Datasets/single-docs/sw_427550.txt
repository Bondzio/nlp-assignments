Prince Edward Islands

The Prince Edward Islands are two islands in the subantarctic Indian Ocean. They are part of South Africa. The two islands are called Marion Island and Prince Edward Island. The only people on the islands are meteorologists and biologists.

The islands were discovered in 1663 by a Dutch explorer. Different people visited the islands over the years but no one settled there. The British claimed the islands in 1908, then gave the islands to South Africa in 1948.
