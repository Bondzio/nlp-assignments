Hail! Minnesota

"Hail! Minnesota" (also simply called "Minnesota" in early years) is the state song of Minnesota. It began at the University of Minnesota in the early 1900s when some students decided to honor their graduating class with a new song. In 1945, the Minnesota State Legislature approved the tune as the state song.
