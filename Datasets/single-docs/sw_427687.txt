Boiler feedwater pump

A boiler feedwater pump is a pump that supplies water to a boiler. The water can be supplied freshly from a water source (such as a reservoir) or from water that has gone through the condensation process from the previous water cycle. The pump is a high-pressure pump, and it can be found in any plant that uses boiler, such as thermal power stations.
