Punic Wars

The Punic Wars were three wars fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC, and were probably the largest wars in the ancient world. They are known as the "Punic" Wars because the Latin term for Carthaginian was "Punici" (older "Poenici", from their Phoenician ancestry).

The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic. Carthage lost the three wars.

Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians. It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean. It was a maritime empire, in contrast to the land-based Roman empire. The Romans decided they needed Sicily, which was then in Carthaginian hands. The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years, and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage.
