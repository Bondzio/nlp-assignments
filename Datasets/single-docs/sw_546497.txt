Sixth form

The sixth form is the final stage in British secondary schools. This term is used in England, Northern Ireland, Wales and some other Commonwealth countries. The sixth form (or 'Key Stage 5') is the final two years of secondary education (U.S. 'high school'). Students (typically between 16 and 18 years of age) prepare for their A-level (or equivalent) examinations.
