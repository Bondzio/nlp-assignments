Random Hearts

Random Hearts is a 1999 American romantic drama movie. It was directed by Sydney Pollack and was produced by Martin Jurow and Marykay Powell. "Random Hearts" was released on October 8, 1999. The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Warren Adler.

The movie gained mixed reviews from critics and holds a 15% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert said, "There are so many good things in "Random Hearts", but they're side by side instead of one after the other. They exist in the same film, but they don't add up to the result of the film. Actually, the film has no resultâ€”just an ending, leaving us with all of those fine pieces, still waiting to come together. If this were a screenplay and not the final product, you could see how with one more rewrite, it might all fall into place."
