SummerSlam (2016)

SummerSlam (2016) was a wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) made by WWE. It happened on August 21, 2016 at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, New York. It was the twenty-ninth time a SummerSlam PPV was held, the second year in a row that it happened at the Barclay's Center and the first WWE PPV since the WWE brand extension started up again.

Twelve matches were performed at the event. In the most important match, Brock Lesnar beat Randy Orton by technical knockout while in another important match, Finn Balor beat Seth Rollins to become the first WWE Universal Champion. 
This match was for the WWE World Championship. "SmackDown" wrestler Dean Ambrose won a match for the title at "Battleground" on July 25 against "Raw" wrestlers Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins. So "SmackDown" needed to find a challenger for Dean for "SummerSlam" and they had a six-pack challenge to find the challenger. The first five spots were given to John Cena, Bray Wyatt, AJ Styles, Baron Corbin and Dolph Ziggler. Apollo Crews took the sixth spot when he won a battle royal, but Dolph won the six-pack.
Because the WWE World Championship was on "SmackDown", "Raw" had to create their own world championship. They called it the WWE Universal Championship. "Raw" commissioner Stephanie McMahon felt that Seth had a chance to pin Dean Ambrose at "Battleground" and that would have brought the World Championship to "Raw" but Roman Reigns was selfish and broke up the pin. Because of that, Stephanie gave Seth the first spot in the first Universal Championship match. Then, Finn beat Cesaro, Kevin Owens and Rusev in a fatal 4-way match and Roman beat Chris Jericho, Sami Zayn and Sheamus in another fatal 4-way. Finally, Finn and Roman fought in a normal match where the winner would face Seth at SummerSlam and Finn won this match.
