Christian liturgy

A liturgy is a special set of rituals done by a group of people as a form of worship. A Christian liturgy is such a liturgy, done by different Christian denominations. The forms of worship changed over time, and different groups also have different prescriptions on how such a celebration should be done. The celebration on a Sunday or a holy day such as Easter might be different from that which is done every day.
