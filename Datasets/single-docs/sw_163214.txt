One Hundred and One Dalmatians

One Hundred and One Dalmatians, often abbreviated as 101 Dalmatians, is the seventeenth animated movie in the Walt Disney classics series. It was made and produced by Walt Disney Productions, and based on the book "The Hundred and One Dalmatians" by Dodie Smith.

The movie stars Rod Taylor as the voice of Pongo, the first of the dalmatians, and Betty Lou Gerson as the voice of the villainous Cruella de Vil.

Disney remade the movie in 1996 as "101 Dalmatians", a live-action film starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil. (None of the animals talked in that version.)
