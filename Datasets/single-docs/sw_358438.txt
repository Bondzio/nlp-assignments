Johann Friedrich Franz Burgmüller

Friedrich Burgmüller (Johann Friedrich Franz Burgmüller, 4 December 1806 – 13 February 1874) was a German pianist and composer. He was born in Regensberg, Germany, to a musical family. In 1832, he settled in Paris and adopted the French musical style. He wrote many works for piano, especially etudes for children that are still played today. His best known work is probably the "Peasant pas de deus" (originally "Souvenirs de Ratisbonne") in Adolphe Adam's ballet "Giselle" (1841). It is not known how this music came to be inserted into the ballet.
