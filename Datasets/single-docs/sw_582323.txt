Dina Ali Lasloom

Dina Ali Lasloom (Arabic: دينا علي السلوم) is a Saudi Arabian teacher who was kidnapped in the Philippines. 

On April 11, 2017, she was traveling from Kuwait to Australia to ask for political asylum, but she was stopped in the Manila airport. She made a video with a cellphone, and said they took her passport and papers, and that her family would kill her. She wanted to escape a forced marriage. Dina borrowed a phone from a Canadian woman to make the video. In the video, Dina said she was locked me up for 13 hours. Then two men came to the airport. Dina said they were her uncles. 

An airport security officer saw three men take Dina. They put duct tape on her hands, feet, and mouth, and took her in a wheelchair onto a Saudia Airlines flight to Riyadh. Other passengers said they heard her scream for help in the airplane. 

The video went viral in Saudi Arabia, with the hashtag #SaveDinaAli, and protesters were waiting for Dina at the Riyadh airport. One Saudi woman, Alaa Anazi, was arrested at the airport. Some women’s rights advocates in Saudi Arabia say Lasloom was taken to a women’s shelter. Others said Alla Anazi was taken to the shelter. Dina did not get off the airplane with the other passengers.
