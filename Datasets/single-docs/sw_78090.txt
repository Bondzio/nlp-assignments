Dysphemism

Dysphemism means using of an harsh or rude word or phrase instead of a polite one. It is more or less the opposite of euphemism.

Examples of dysphemism are “dead tree edition” for the paper version of an online magazine, or the American soldiers calling their common breakfast of creamed chipped beef on toast “shit on a shingle”.
