Network Rail New Measurement Train

The Network Rail New Measurement Train (NMT) is a special train used to check how good rail tracks are. Network Rail engineers use this information to decide which tracks to work on. The NMT is converted from High Speed Train Class 43 power cars and Mark 3 coaches. It can check the condition of all main lines in Great Britain in two weeks.
