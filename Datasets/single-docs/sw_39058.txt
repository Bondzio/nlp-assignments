A small solar system body (SSSB) is a term defined in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union to describe solar system objects which are neither planets, nor dwarf planets:

Therefore it refers to these objects that can be further grouped based on their orbit or what they are made of:

Some of the larger "small solar system bodies" may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets, pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly-round shape).
