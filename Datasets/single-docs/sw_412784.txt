Ingelger

Ingelger (or Ingelgarius) († ) was a Frankish nobleman who became the first count of Anjou. He began a known as House of Ingelger. 

Ingelger was the son of a Frankish nobleman Tertullus and his wife Petronilla. She was the niece of Raino, Bishop of Angers. Petronilla was also a relative of Hugh the Abbot, an counselor to both Louis II and Louis III of France. His mother's influence was one of the reasons for Ingelger's success. Records of the time call Ingelger a "miles optimus" (a great military man). Louis II appointed Ingelger as viscount of Orléans which at the time was under the rule of the Bishop of Orléans.

Ingelger married Adelis, a close relative of Raino, Bishop of Angers. He was succeeded by their son:
