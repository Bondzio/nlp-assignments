SoulDecision

soulDecision was a Canadian pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia. 

soulDecision was formed in 1993 under the original name, Indecision. They changed their name to soulDecision because of naming conflicts. Even though the band started during the boy band era, they were not a boy band, as they played their own instruments and wrote their own music. The band released their debut full-length album "No One Does It Better" on August 22, 2000 in Canada. The album featured their hit single "Faded" which reached #1 on Canada's singles chart as well as #22 in the United States. The album also featured the single "Ooh It's Kinda Crazy" which reached #1 in Canada and was the number one request on MTV's Total Request Live at the time. The band toured with Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera and 'N Sync.

Lead singer Trevor Guthrie left the band in 2005 to write and record his first solo record. The group split up after.
