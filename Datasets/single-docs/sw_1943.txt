Butter

Butter is a dairy food product. It is made by moving the cream obtained from whole milk for a long time. The fat in the milk separates from the liquid. The fat is butter.

Butter is commonly used as a spread on bread, as a main ingredient in biscuits, as a shortening agent in some baking and cooking recipes, and sometimes as a frying medium.

Most of the time, butter is made from cows' milk, butter can also be made from the milk of other mammals, like sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt, flavorings and preservatives are sometimes added to butter.

Many people use butter in their foods instead of oil. Butter is preserved by keeping it in the refrigerator.

Cultured butter is a butter made from a fermented cream. Sweet cream butter is butter made from pasteurized fresh cream. Raw cream butter is butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream. 

Butter can also be produced from the milk of buffalo, camel, goat, ewe, and mares. Cream is separated from the milk. The cream can be either supplied by a fluid milk dairy or separated from whole milk by the butter manufacturer.Â
