Ugly Betty

Ugly Betty is a Golden Globe- and Peabody Award-winning American comedy-drama television series. It stars America Ferrera, Vanessa Williams, and Eric Mabius. It premiered on September 28, 2006, on ABC in the United States. The series follows the life of Betty Suarez (Ferrera), and her incongruous job at the ultra-chic New York City fashion magazine ""Mode"". Betty's status as a "fish out of water" drives much of the plot. Ugly Betty ended on April 14, 2010 after low ratings during season 4.
