Saint Matthias

Matthias was the apostle who replaced Judas Iscariot. This was stated in the Acts of the Apostles. Unlike the other apostles, his appointment was not made personally by Jesus.

After the betrayal of Judas, the disciples of Jesus needed to choose a new apostle. To do this they nominated 2 men - Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias.
