Baryonyx

Baryonyx was a carnivorous dinosaur discovered in clay pits just south of Dorking, England, and also in northern Spain. It has been dated to the Barremian period of Early Cretaceous Period, around 125 million years ago.

It was first discovered in 1983 by William Walker, who was an English amateur fossil hunter. A group of scientists lead by Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner of the Natural History Museum examined the skeleton and named Baryonyx walkeri, after the man who discovered it. Other good skeletons were discovered in England and in Spain, which gave scientists a good idea of what the dinosaur was like.

Baryonyx probably grew up to 8.5 meters long, with claws which were up to 35 centimeters long. It ate fish, like a grizzely bear would.
