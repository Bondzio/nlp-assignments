Fennec fox

The fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small fox that lives in sandy deserts. It lives in the Sahara (in northern Africa) and the northern part of Saudi Arabia.

This fox is agile. It has huge ears and very large eyes. The large ears help the fox lose excess heat. They also help it hear its prey from a long distance away. The fennec fox has hairy feet that protect it from the hot sand. 

The fennec fox is nocturnal (most active at night). It rests during the day in a burrow in the sand. It lives in groups of up to 10 animals. It marks its territory with urine. Its life span is 10 to 12 years and in captivity 10-14 years.

Fennec foxes can reproduce at the age of about 9 months.
