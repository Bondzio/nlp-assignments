Jeffrey Masson

Jeffrey Masson (born 1941) is a psychotherapist and historian of psychotherapy who wrote a controversial book, "", about Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud. In the book, Masson accuses Freud of hiding evidence that some patients were sexually abused by their parents.

Masson was research director of the Sigmund Freud Archives in New York City. He was removed from the job after saying Freud was responsible for "the present-day sterility of psychoanalysis throughout the world."
