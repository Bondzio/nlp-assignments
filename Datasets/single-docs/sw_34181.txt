Southwest Airlines

Southwest Airlines is a low-cost airline based in Dallas, Texas. The airline has been in business since 1971. It travels mainly in the United States but also to the Caribbean and Mexico to 93 cities. It does not center its flights around one airport hub, and operates what is called "point to point". Many of Southwest's flights are to airports in the Southwestern United States, such as Dallas Love Field and Houston Hobby Airport, but it also flies to airports in other parts of the country, such as Chicago Midway Airport and Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Recently, it started international flights. The company is the world's largest operator of the Boeing 737. It only operates the Boeing 737 in its current fleet.
Southwest Airlines is known for its fun-loving attitude and passion for customer service, as well as its brightly painted planes. The planes used to be painted red and brown. Now they're painted red, blue and yellow. 
For several years, Southwest was the largest airline in the United States, but is not anymore now that American Airlines merged with US Airways. However, Southwest is now the world's largest low-cost carrier.

Southwest Airlines bought the smaller AirTran Airways in 2010 and kept the Southwest Airlines brand.
