Ontario New Democratic Party

The Ontario New Democratic Party (or NDP) is a social democratic political party in Ontario, Canada. It is part of the national New Democratic Party. It formed in 1961 when the Ontario section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation merged with the Ontario Federation of Labour.

The party formed the government in the 1990 Ontario general election. This was the first provincial government formed by the NDP east of Manitoba. However, the party was blamed for a recession that hit Canada and lost the 1995 general election.
