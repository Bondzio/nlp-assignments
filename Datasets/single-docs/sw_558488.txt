Foster Hewitt Memorial Award

The Foster Hewitt Memorial Award is an award named after Foster Hewitt and presented by the Hockey Hall of Fame to members of the radio and television industry who make outstanding contributions to their profession and the game of ice hockey during their broadcasting career. The award winners are selected by the NHL Broadcasters' Association.

This award should not be confused with the ACTRA Foster Hewitt Award, which was presented by ACTRA, the Canadian association of actors and broadcasters, for excellence in general sports broadcasting. That award was discontinued in 1986.
