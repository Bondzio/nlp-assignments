Congo at the Olympics

Congo at the Olympics is a history which includes 11 games in 10 countries and 60+ athletes. Since 1964, athletes of the Congo have taken part in the "Olympic Movement".

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for the Congo is CCGO.

The National Olympic Committee for the Congo ("Comit√© National Olympique et Sportif Congolais") was formed in 1964 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year.

The Republic of the Congo, competing as Congo, was first at the Olympic Games in 1964. Competitors from the Congo missed the 1968 Summer Olympics and boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics along with most other African nations. Congo has never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

As of 2012, no athlete from Congo has ever won an Olympic medal.
