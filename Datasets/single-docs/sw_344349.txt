Super glue

Super glue, or cyanoacrylate, is the general name for a family of fast-acting adhesives with industrial, medical and household uses. It usually comes in a small tube, and is often sold as "Super Glue" or "Krazy Glue". 

They are extremely strong glues. However, the glue is not so good at resisting shear (sideways stress). 

There are different versions for medical and veterinary use, developed to be non-toxic and less irritating to skin tissue. 

Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known as instant glues.

Super glue will stick to human skin instantly, meaning that you can glue your fingers together, or to an object, alternate use to seal small cuts scraps and mild wounds. Never use in deep or puncture wounds. If this happens, it can be removed with acetone, commonly found in nail polish remover. Super glue will burn if it comes in contact with cotton, including cotton clothing, cotton gloves, and cotton swabs. The severity of this reaction can range from a small amount of heat and smoke to starting a fire, depending on the amount of glue and/or cotton involved.
