Woolworth Building

The Woolworth Building is a skyscraper in New York City, United States. It is 241 meters (792Â feet) tall and has 57 floors. It was built in 1913 and is one of the tallest buildings in the world.

A businessman named Frank Winfield Woolworth wanted the building to be built for his business, F. W. Woolworth Company. It was created by an architect named Cass Gilbert. The building was called "the Cathedral of Commerce," which means it was like a church of business.

The Woolworth Building was the tallest building in the world from 1913 to 1930. Before it was built, the tallest building in the world was the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. The Bank of the Manhattan Company Building (now named The Trump Building) became the tallest twenty-seven years later.
