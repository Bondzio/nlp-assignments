Ichnology

Ichnology is the study of trace fossils of once-living things. 

Burrows, trackways, trails and borings are all examples of traces made by organisms. Scientists study traces made by plants and animals to try to determine their behavior. An ichnologist is a scientist whose area of study and research is ichnology. 

A species name given to a fossil is called an ichnospecies. It is written in italics with a initial. It is shown to be an ichnospecies by the abbreviation "isp".
