Equirectangular projection

The equirectangular projection (also called the geographic projection) is a simple map view made about 100 AD. The projection maps Longitude and Latitude (vertical and horizontal map lines) to even straight lines. Because the map is stretched out, it can not be used in navigation. Its main use is to show large map areas.
