Internet of things

Internet of things is an idea from computer science: connecting ordinary things like lights and doors to a computer network to make them "intelligent". An embedded system or a computer connects each thing together in a network and to the internet. Some technologies used for the internet of things are: RFid and meshnets. 
The connections allow each thing to collect and exchange data, and we can control them remotely or by setting rules or chains of actions. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.
