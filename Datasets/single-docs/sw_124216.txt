Scarlet macaw

The scarlet macaw ("Ara macao") is a type of parrot. It is native to humid evergreen forests of tropical South America. 

Its range is from south-eastern Mexico to Amazonian Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil in lowlands up to 500 m (1,640 ft) (at least formerly) up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft). It has suffered from local extinction through habitat destruction and capture for the parrot trade, but locally it remains fairly common. It is the national bird of Honduras.
