Sturmabteilung

The Sturmabteilung (; often shortened to SA) was a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. 

In English, they are often called the Stormtroopers or the Brownshirts, while "Sturmabteilung" literally translates to " detachment" or "assault section". The group was important in helping Adolf Hitler gain power in the 1930s. They wore a brown uniform, similar to the black uniform worn by Mussolini's Blackshirts.

The word "Sturmabteilung" was used before the founding of the Nazi Party in 1919. It originally comes from the specialized assault troops used by Germany in World War I utilising "Hutier" infiltration tactics.

The SA played a key role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s. In 1934, however, he abolished the organization and sent the Schutzstaffel to arrest and kill their leaders.
