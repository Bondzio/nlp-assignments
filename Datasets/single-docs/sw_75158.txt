New Order are a band from Salford, popular in the 1980s. Its members are: Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris, Gillian Gilbert, Phil Cunningham, and Tom Chapman. Their biggest hit is "Blue Monday", which was the biggest selling 12" record of all time. They started in 1980 after Ian Curtis, the singer of Joy Division, which the members were part of, committed suicide, because they had agreed before Curtis died that if any member left they would not carry on playing as Joy Division. They have broke up twice, first in 1993 and then in 2007. In 2011 they reformed. They have released nine studio albums.
