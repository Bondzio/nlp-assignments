Classical period (music)

The classical period in music was from about 1750 to 1820.

The renaissance or baroque eras included many important composers and trends. However, the choral music of the classical era was dominated by three composers: Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827).
