Chocolate cake

A chocolate cake is a cake made with chocolate or cocoa. The ingredients are put into a bowl and mixed together; then the mixed ingredients are put into a cake tin and put in an oven until it is fully cooked. Then the cake is taken out of the oven and placed on a cooling stand. If the cake maker wants to, they can ice the cake, when it has cooled down, by spreading thick icing on it. Chocolate cakes are a sold in shops as well as made at home. They are a sweet food and should not be eaten all the time, which would be unhealthy.

There are many different types of chocolate cake, depending on the recipe and different types of chocolate used. Different countries have different recipes for chocolate cakes. In France, "g√¢teau au chocolate" is popular. In Germany, "Sachertorte" is popular.

In 1828 Conrad Van Houten of the Netherlands made a mechanical extraction method for taking away the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the mostly de-fatted cacao. It was a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into powder. The processes made chocolate from an luxury to an cheap daily snack. A process for making smoother chocolate called conching was made in 1879 by Swiss Rodolphe and made it easier to bake with chocolate as it ""amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters"." Until 1890 to 1900 chocolate recipes were mostly for drinks.
In the U.S., chocolate decadence cakes were popular in the 1980s; in the 1990s, single-serve chocolate cakes with liquid chocolate centers were popular.
