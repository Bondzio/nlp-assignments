Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington

Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, KG, GCB, GCH, PC, FRS (1 May 1769â€“14 September 1852) was a soldier and statesman. He was one of the leading military and political figures of 19th-century Britain. His defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 put him in the top rank of Britain's military heroes. In 2002 he was number 15 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

Wellesley was born in Dublin into a wealthy Anglo-Irish aristocratic protestant family. Wellington was twice Tory Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement in 1846. 

Starting as an ensign in the British Army, he served well in the Napoleonic Wars, eventually reaching the rank of Field Marshal. Wellington is often compared to the 1st Duke of Marlborough. They had many things in common, including being in politics after a highly successful military career. He remained Commander-in-Chief of the British Army until his death.
