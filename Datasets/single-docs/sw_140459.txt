Cognitive-behavioral therapy

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy which is used to help people change thoughts, feelings and behaviors that are causing them problems. Psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge, then challenge those problematic thought patterns, feelings and behaviors. CBT refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions, interpretations, beliefs and responses. Those systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, combining them. It is used to try to change problem-causing emotions and behaviors.

It can be used to treat mood disorders (like depression), personality disorders (like borderline personality disorder), posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias and drug addiction. CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online.
