Semitic languages

Semitic refers to a group of languages including Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic (the Semitic peoples). 

The Semitic languages are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family, which originated in the Middle East. Semitic languages are spoken by more than 470 million people across much of Western Asia, North Africa and the Horn of Africa, as well as in large expatriate communities in North America and Europe. 

The name was taken from Shem, a son of Noah in Genesis (chapters 6-11).
