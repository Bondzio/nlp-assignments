Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot

Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot (10 May 1748, Yvetot - 1831, Rouen) was a French ornithologist.

Vieillot described a large number of birds for the first time, especially those he met during the time he spent in the West Indies and North America. 26 genera and 32 species of North American birds were first described by him. Most of the well-known North American birds, such as the Wild Turkey,the Pintail, the Cedar Waxwing, and the Scarlet Tanager, were given Latin names by him.
