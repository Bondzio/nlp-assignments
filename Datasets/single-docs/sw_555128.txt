Władysław Gomułka was a Polish communist politician. After World War II he was the leader of Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970.

Gomułka was one of the key leaders of the Warsaw Pact. He supported Poland's participation in Prague Spring in August 1968. One of his notable achievements was negotiating the Treaty of Warsaw (1970) with West Germany. The treaty meant Germany agreed to the post-World War II borders.
