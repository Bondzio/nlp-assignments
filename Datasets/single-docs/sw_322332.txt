Uzen Province

During the Edo period and early Meiji period, the Uesugi clan were daimyo in the area. 

Copper coins were minted in the province in 1861-1863 ("Bunkyu 1-3").

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Unzen Province were reformed in the 1870s.
