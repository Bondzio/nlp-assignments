Triskaidekaphobia

Triskadekaphobia is the fear of the number thirteen. The number 13 has been linked to bad luck in the western world. Buildings in the United States often skip the number 13 in labeling floors. Floors are numbered ... 11, 12, 14.

The term was first used by Isador Coriat in "Abnormal Psychology".

There is also a fear of Friday the 13th. This fear is called "paraskevidekatriaphobia" or "friggatriskaidekaphobia".
