Warsaw Pact

The Warsaw Pact or Warsaw Treaty Organization was officially named the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Assistance, and was an organization of Central and Eastern European Communist states. 

It was established in 1955 in Warsaw, Poland in response to West Germany joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The treaty was signed in Warsaw, on 14 May 1955 and official copies were made in the languages of Russian, Polish, Czech and German. The Pact lasted until the end of the Cold War when some members quit in 1991, following the collapse of the Eastern bloc and political changes in the Soviet Union.


All the Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe signed except Yugoslavia.
