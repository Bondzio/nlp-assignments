Equation

A mathematical equation is an expression containing at least one variable (=unknown value) and an "equals sign" ( = ) with a mathematical expression on each side of it. The equals sign says that both sides are exactly the same value. An equation can be as simple as x=0, or as hard as 4(3y^99)+76=42รท3x or harder.

There are two kinds of mathematical equations:

The second kind is often used to solve problems in which you have to know the value of some variables. For example,

The second kind of equation is used in algebra. For example, to solve the equation 2x = 8 by finding x you would follow an algebraic rule. Then you can work out that x = 4.

Equations can be classified by the types of operations and quantities involved. Some types of equations are:
