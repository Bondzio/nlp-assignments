Boomslang

A boomslang is a small, venomous snake found in Africa. Its name means "tree snake" in Dutch and Afrikaans.

Boomslangs eat small animals like chameleons, frogs, and birds, but they also eat eggs. Like all snakes, boomslangs do not chew they swallow everything whole.

The venom (poison) of boomslangs disrupts the clotting of your blood, and this can kill you. After a bite, you can sometimes feel a headache, nausea and sleepiness. If you think you may have been bitten by a boomslang, you should get an antidote. This does not happen often, as boomslangs only bite humans when they feel attacked.
