The Godfather

The Godfather is a 1972 American movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, and stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The story of the movie takes place from 1945 to 1955.

It has been considered one of the best movies about the Mafia. In addition, many have called it the best movie of all time; it also appears on many such lists, including AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (where it was ranked at number three).

"The Godfather" won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (for Marlon Brando, who refused the award), and Best Adapted Screenplay. 

A sequel, "The Godfather Part II", was released in 1974 and won another Best Picture Oscar. It was the only sequel to do so until 2003's "". The third movie in the Godfather trilogy, "The Godfather Part III", came out in 1990. The critics thought it was not as good as the other two movies.
