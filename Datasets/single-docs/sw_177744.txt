San Gabriel Mountains

The San Gabriel Mountains are a mountain range in southern California, in the United States. They are in both Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County. Mount San Antonio is the highest point in the mountains range, standing 10,064 feet (3,067 m) tall. The mountains separate the basin of Los Angeles in the south from the Mojave Desert in the north. The San Gabriel River and Los Angeles River are the major rivers that receive water from the mountains. California State Route 2 is the major highway that runs through the San Gabriel Mountains.
