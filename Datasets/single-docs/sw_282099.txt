BlackBerry

BlackBerry is a line of mobile phones made by the Canadian company BlackBerry (originally known as Research In Motion, or RIM, NASDAQ:BBRY). It does many different things like a computer but is small enough to fit in someone's hand. It is a mobile phone; it makes calls without wires. It can access the Internet as well. It also has a calendar and camera, and can send text messages. The BlackBerry started out as a pager and later turned into a mobile phone. The BlackBerry has a PIN which is an eight character hexadecimal identification number which is given to every BlackBerry phone. The President of The United States Barack Obama uses and supports the BlackBerry.
