Parable of the budding fig tree

The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree is a parable of Jesus. It is written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:32-35, Mark 13:28-31 and Luke 21:29-33. The parable compares the Kingdom of God with a budding fig tree, the opposite of the barren fig tree.

He told them this parable:
This eschatological parable follows the Olivet discourse in Luke 21:5-28 (and Matthew 24 and Mark 13). New buds appear on the branches of trees when Winter ends. The buds open into blossoms and green leaves in Spring. Fruit starts to appear as Summer arrives. When the signs of the end of the age start to happen, it means Jesus will return soon.
