Alexander Chizhevsky

Alexander Chizhevsky (also Aleksandr Leonidovich Tchijevsky) (7 February 1897 – 20 December 1964) was a Soviet-era interdisciplinary scientist, a biophysicist. 

He also was noted for his work in "cosmo-biology" and hematology". He may be most notable for his use of historical research techniques to link the 11-year solar cycle, Earth’s climate and the mass activity of peoples.
