Persecution of Muslims

Persecution of Muslims is the religious persecution of Muslims (persecution based on their religion). This can mean any form of participating in discrimination against Muslims. This includes using violence against them or putting them in prison. Muslims were persecuted during the crusades. There was also persecution during the Mongol invasion and in the Iberian Peninsula when they were subject to the Inquisitions. Modern persecution of Muslims exists in many countries such as Myanmar, Central African Republic and Serbia. 

Islam is a major religion and like other major religions they have suffered violent persecution.
