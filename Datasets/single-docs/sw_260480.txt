Sodium hypophosphite

Sodium hypophosphite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaHPO. It contains sodium and hypophosphite ions. 

It is a white solid. It is a strong reducing agent. When it is heated, it produces phosphine gas and sodium phosphite. It is quite poisonous. It can be oxidized to sodium phosphate.

It is made by heating white phosphorus in sodium hydroxide solution. This makes phosphine gas and sodium hypophosphite.

It is used for nickel plating without doing electrolysis.
