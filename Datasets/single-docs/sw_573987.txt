WWE Universal Championship

The WWE Universal Championship is a wrestling title owned by WWE. It was created for the "Raw" brand after the return of the brand extension. The WWE Championship became exclusive of "SmackDown Live". The first champion was Finn Bálor and the current is Goldberg.

With the return of the WWE Brand Extension in the middle of 2016, a draft took place in July 19. The WWE Champion Dean Ambrose was drafted to "SmackDown". And as a result, "Raw" was left without a world title. On the July 25, 2016 episode of "Raw", Stephanie McMahon and the general manager Mick Foley created the WWE Universal Championship to be the world title of the program. 

The first champion was determined at SummerSlam on August 21, 2016. Finn Bálor beat Seth Rollins to win the title.

As of 11, 2017.
