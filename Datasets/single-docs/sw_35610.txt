Neurology

Neurology is the branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the nervous system. Neurology is about the medical diagnosis and treatment of conditions and illnesses of the nervous system. This can include both the physical condition of the brain, nerves, and brain messages between the body and the nervous system. Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neurobiology, which is the scientific study of the nervous system.
