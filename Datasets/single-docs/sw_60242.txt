List of Christian denominations by number of members

This article gives information about the relative size of denominations, based mainly on claims by the churches themselves.


Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, partly because of the difficulty in determining which denominations should be placed in the category. It seems however clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism by number of followers. Often that number is put at 800 million. Some sources, which put the number at 800 million, include also Anglicanism (see below) within Protestantism. However, the 33,000 Protestant denominations in the world differ vastly to slightly theologically and do not form a single communion.

Note: Groups listed have origins in the Lord's Recovery movement associated with Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. The Shouters are an offshoot of the Local Churches considered a dangerous sect by the Chinese government; due to the extremely decentralized nature of both groups, there is controversy over which house churches should be actually considered part of each. Eastern Lightning, which is in turn an offshoot of The Shouters, is very hierarchical (in contrast to its predecessors) and teaches that Christ has already returned as a woman named Lightning Deng.

The most common estimates of the number of Orthodox Christians worldwide is approximately 225â€“300 million. There are also a number of autonomous Orthodox churches, that account for no more than 12 million and are united in communion with the rest of the Eastern Orthodox church, plus some not universally recognized churches and Orthodox splinter groups.




Note: Unitarian Universalism, which counts 0.6 million adherents, developed out of Christian traditions but no longer identifies as a Christian denomination.
