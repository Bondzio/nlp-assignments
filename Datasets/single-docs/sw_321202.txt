Chikugo Province

Chikugo had borders with Hizen, Chikuzen, Bungo, and Higo Provinces.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Kurume, Fukuoka.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Chikugo Province were reformed in the 1870s.


"K≈çra taisha" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Chikugo.
