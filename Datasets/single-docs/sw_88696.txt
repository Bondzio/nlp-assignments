The name "Mets" is short for "Metropolitans". There was an old team in the 1880s called the New York Metropolitans.

One example is the Metropolitan Opera, which is also nicknamed "The Met".

The Mets first played their home games at the Polo Grounds. They opened Shea Stadium in 1964. After 45 seasons at Shea, they opened Citi Field in 2009, nextdoor to Shea. Shea was torn down during the 2009 season.
The Mets have won the World series two times, in 1969 and 1986. In 1973, 2000, and 2015, the Mets went to the World Series, but lost to the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, and Kansas City Royals.
