Katsuō-ji

, also known as "Katsuo-dera", is a Japanese Buddhist temple in Minō, which is in the mountains of northern Osaka Prefecture.

Katsuō-ji is one in a grouping of Buddhist temples which are pilgrimage sites in the Kansai region.

The temple site was first named Miroku-ji in 765.

The name "Katsuō-ji" was given by the Emperor Seiwa.

In 1184, the temple was destroyed by fire, but it was re-built.

Daruma dolls are often returned to the temple and left somewhere on the grounds.
