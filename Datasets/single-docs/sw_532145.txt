Brachial plexus

The brachial plexus is a group of nerves. It runs from the vertebral column to the arm. 

The brachial plexus is divided into five "roots", three "trunks", six "divisions", three "cords", and five "branches". 

The five roots come out of the spinal cord. They are each named after the part of the spinal cord they come out of: C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1.

These roots join to form three trunks:

Each trunk then splits into two divisions:

These six divisions join up again to become the three cords. 

The nerves that come out of the brachial plexus include:
