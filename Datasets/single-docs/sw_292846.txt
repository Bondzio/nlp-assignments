Euphorbia milii

Euphorbia milii (also called Crown-of-thorns or Christ Plant) is a woody, succulent species of "Euphorbia" native to Madagascar. The species name commemorates Baron Milius, once governor of RÃ©union, who introduced the species to France in 1821. It is suspected that the species was introduced to the Middle East in ancient times, and legend associates it with the crown of thorns worn by Jesus.
