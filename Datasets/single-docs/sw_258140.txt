Deprotonation

Deprotonation is the removal of a hydrogen ion from a substance. A hydrogen atom normally contains 1 proton and 1 electron. When it is oxidized, it loses the electron, turning it into a hydrogen ion. A hydrogen cation is the same as a proton. Substances are deprotonated by other substances more basic than themselves. The base itself is protonated.
