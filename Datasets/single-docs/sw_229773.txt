Joe Louis Arena

Joe Louis Arena, nicknamed The Joe and JLA is a hockey arena in Detroit, Michigan. It is the home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League.

The arena will close at the end of the 2016â€“17 NHL season, with the Red Wings set to open the new Little Caesars Arena a few blocks away. Once the Wings move, the arena will be torn down and replaced by a combined hotel and retail development.
