Anna (Disney)

Anna is a princess from Disney's movie, "Frozen". For most of the movie, she is voiced by Kristen Bell. However, "Young Anna" is voiced by Livvy Stubenrauch. Anna has an older sister named Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel), who can create anything with snow and ice. 

This is what the official "Frozen" website says about Anna:
"Anna (voice of Kristen Bell) is more daring than graceful and, at times, can act before she thinks. But she's also the most optimistic and caring person you'll ever meet."

In the movie, Anna meets a prince named Hans. She wants to marry him. Then, even though it is summer, Elsa freezes everything. Anna has to find Elsa and make her bring back the summer. Soon she meets another man named Kristoff who likes ice and helps Anna find Elsa.
