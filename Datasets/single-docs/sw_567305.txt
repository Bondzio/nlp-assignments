Meroktenos

Meroktenos is a genus of prosauropodomorph dinosaur from the Late Triassic of Lesotho. There are no known paleoart images or sketches of this dinosaur. It is so rare and so little is known about it. The name "Meroktenos" comes from ancient Greek words "mēros" (femur) and "ktênos" (beast). This was because it was first described based on its femur. It was originally discovered in 1956. It included a few other bones that later turned out to belong to a different dinosaur.
