Inca Civil War

The Inca Civil War, the Inca Dynastic War, or the Inca War of Succession, was a civil war in the Inca Empire. It was fought between two brothers, Huáscar and Atahualpa, sons of Huayna Capac, over who would be the next emperor. The war came after Huayna Capac's death in 1527, and lasted from 1529 until 1532. When their father died, the empire was divided between the two brothers. Huáscar got most part of it, with the capital Cusco. Atahualpa got the northern parts, including Quito.

Huáscar started the war because he saw himself as the rightful heir to the kingdom. Atahualpa proved to be a better war tactician than his brother, and commanded a much bigger army. The empire was reunited under Atahualpa in 1532, but he was executed by the Spanish less than a year later.

It was partly because of this civil war that the Spanish conquistadors, under Francisco Pizarro, were successful.
