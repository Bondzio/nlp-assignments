Celebrity Deathmatch

Celebrity Deathmatch was a claymation television that aired on MTV between May 1998 and March 2007. Numerous celebrities were featured on CDM made with clay, including though not limited to Barbra Streisand, Cher, Ice-T, Katie Couric and Sharon Stone where they would fight to the death. It was hosted by Johnny Gomez and Nick Diamond. In the ring was wrestler turned judge Mills Lane (although the real Mills Lane had a stroke in 2002, and the voice of Mills on Deathmatch was done by someone else thereafter); furthermore, Stone Cold Steve Austin was a featured guest host for the show. Other hosts included Stacey Cornbred (though she died in an explosion) and Debbie Matenopolous (for whom Nick represented strong contempt).
