Fulham F.C.

Fulham Football Club, is an English football club from London. It plays in a white shirt and black shorts for home games. For away games, it plays in red shirts and white shorts in 2013/14, but has played in colours such as green, yellow or black. The team's away kit in {(2014)} is navy with orange sleeves. Shahid Khan owns the club. He is from America, and also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars, a famous NFL team in American.

The club was made in 1879 as Fulham St.Andrews. Lots of famous players used to play for Fulham, like Johnny Haynes (1950s), Bobby Moore (1970s), George Best (1970s) and Edwin van der Sar (2000s). Fulham have only won 1 trophy; the Inter Toto Cup in 2003.

When Mohamed Al-Fayed bought Fulham, it was in the 2nd division of English football (English Division Two). He put lots of money into the club, and he made good choices about the club. The club won promotion two times, so in 2001 it was a Premiership team.


Fulham's stadium is called "Craven Cottage", it was built 100 years ago. It has a pretty building in one corner of the pitch, this is the "Cottage". The fans of Fulham like to call it "The Cottage", and it can have 26,500 people sitting in it.

From 2002 to 2004, Fulham had to play at Loftus Road, which is the ground of Queens Park Rangers, near the BBC. This was because the club needed to change Craven Cottage because of new rules. The rules said that nobody can stand at football games, so the club had to have new seats.

Some people who live near to Craven Cottage do not like having a big club near to them. They made it hard for the club to be allowed to make the changes. This is why the changes took a long time, even though it was easy work for the builders.

Because of the "Cottage", the club and its supporters are called "The Cottagers".

The club plays in the Premier League, the top football league in England. The club is managed by Felix Magart who preceded Martin Jol and Rene Mulensteen (after Roy Hodgeson)
