Life Before Life

Life Before Life is a book written by psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker. It presents an overview of more than 40 years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia into children's reports of past life memories. 

The book suggests that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain, which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation. "Life Before Life" has been translated into ten languages and the foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson.
