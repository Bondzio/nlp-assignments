Johannes Kepler

Johannes Kepler (27 December 1571 â€“ 15 November 1630) was a German mathematics teacher and astronomer. He was Tycho Brahe's apprentice. Tycho Brahe looked at the way the planets moved in the sky. Johannes Kepler found a simple way to say how the planets move. Kepler also studied other things like Kepler's supernova.

A planet moves along a path called an orbit. Kepler used three laws to say what form the path has and how fast the planet moves


Kepler published the first two laws in 1609, and the third in 1619.
