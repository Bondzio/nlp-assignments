Edward E. Smith Memorial Award

The NESFA gives the Edward E. Smith Memorial Award for Imaginative Fiction award each year to a science fiction writer. The award is for their work and for acting like "Doc" Smith. Many people who knew Smith loved him. The award is also called the Skylark.

The award is a trophy with a large lens in it. Regular members of the New England Science Fiction Association, Inc. vote for the winner. It is presented at Boskone, NESFA's annual convention.
