Anemometer

An anemometer is a device used to measure wind speed. It is found in most weather stations. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word "ἄνεμος ", meaning "wind". It describes any airspeed measurement instrument used in meteorology or aerodynamics. Leon Battista Alberti described an anemometer for the first time around 1450.
