We Wish You a Merry Christmas

"We Wish You a Merry Christmas" is a popular 16th century Christmas carol that comes from the West Country of England. It comes from the English tradition in which rich people gave Christmas treats such as figgy puddings, a type of pudding like the modern day Christmas pudding, to carolers on Christmas Eve.
