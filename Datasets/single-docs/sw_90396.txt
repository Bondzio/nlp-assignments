Legendary Pokémon

Legendary Pokémon are very rare Pokémon in the "Pokémon" world. Characters in the series often believe that the said Pokémon does not exist or claim that very few people have seen them. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most other Pokémon. They have powers that other Pokémon do not have. In the games some roam around, while others stay in one spot until the trainer knocks it out or captures it. If the player defeats a legendary Pokémon, they will not be available again, because there is only one of them. Because of this, players usually save their game before going to battle the Pokémon. A dusk ball is a popular choice for catching legendary Pokémon because many can be found in caves but the master ball and ultra ball are also popular. But legendary Pokémon can also be caught with a normal Pokeball.
