University of al-Karaouine

The University of al-Karaouine (or al-Qarawiyyin, ) is a university in Fes, Morocco. The mosque was founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859. It had a school, or madrasa, that taught students about Islam. It later became one of the most important centres of learning in the Muslim world. It was made a part of Morocco's modern university system in 1963. It is the oldest continually operating school in the world. It is sometimes also called the oldest university, although some scholars argue that this is not correct.
