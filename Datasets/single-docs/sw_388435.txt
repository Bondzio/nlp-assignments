Insignia was originally intended to be the second generation Saturn Aura, but because GM stopped making the Saturn it was instead offered to Buick and was marketed as fifth generation Buick Regal. The model was facelifted in 2013 and as a 2014 model for the Buick. The second generation will go on sale in mid-2017 and a new version of the Buick Regal is also expected, it will also be sold in Australia as the Holden Commodore as Australian production of it will end soon.
