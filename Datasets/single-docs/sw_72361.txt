Etruscan origins

An Etruscan origin from the Near East is one of the theories scholars are considering. The other possibility is that they developed right where they are now.

The known Etruscan vocabulary is very limited, because we have no continuous prose, just engravings on gravestones. We do know it was different from the neighbouring Italic and Celtic peoples, who spoke Indo-European languages.

Some scholars see, in Urartean art, architecture, language and culture, traces of kinship to the Etruscans of the Italian peninsula.

One or two experts have suggested the Etruscan was an Armenian dialect.

According to Isaac Taylor, Etruscan words have been shown from the resources of the Armenian, Albanian and the Rhaeto-Romansch Indo-European languages, but that is because these languages had contact with the Etruscan languages and were influenced by it. However, only the Rhaeto-Romansch languages were actually spoken near the Etruscans, and contact between Albanians and Armenians and the Etrscuans hasn't actually been shown.
