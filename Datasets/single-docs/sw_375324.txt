Platt Amendment

The Platt Amendment was an amendment made in 1901 to a resolution of the United States Congress. It said that all treaties with Cuba had to be approved by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. had the right to interfere in Cuba's affairs if order broke down within Cuba. It also declared Guant√°namo Bay to be U.S. territory.
