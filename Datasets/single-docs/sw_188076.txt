Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon

Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon is the 4th Destroy All Humans! in the series first released December 1, 2008 in North America for the Xbox 360. The game is made by THQ's Sandblast Games studio for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon has around 30 story missions, 20 side quests, and multiplayer modes. As with previous games in the series, most story missions can be played in any order. Creative director Jon Knoles said that the side quests would have something to do with the story.

The player plays as Crypto, an alien. He can shoot humans, use the jet pack, and use Psychokinesis at the same time. There are now flying enemies, like helicopters and Nexo UFO's that can attack Crypto while he is in his UFO. Buildings can be destroyed and scarred in different ways when attacked with different weapons. The game has a new alert scheme with police, SWAT, military awareness, and Nexo alert. Electricity goes through power lines when damage is caused to them. The player can exit and enter some buildings during some missions.

The game was given 34/100 by the site Metacritic.
