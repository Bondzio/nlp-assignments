James McCoubrey

James Foster McCoubrey (13 September 1901 â€“ 5 July 2013) was an American supercentenarian who was the world's oldest living man verified by the Gerontology Research Group. He was considered to be the world's oldest living man since the death of 116-year-old Japanese man Jiroemon Kimura on 12 June 2013 until his own death less than one month later. However, less than a month after McCoubrey's death, the Gerontology Research Group confirmed the longevity of New York man Salustiano Sanchez, who was born on 8 June 1901, making McCoubrey the second-oldest man at the time of his death.

McCoubrey was born on 13 September 1901 in St. John's, Newfoundland.

McCoubrey died on 5 July 2013 in Walnut Creek, California from pneumonia, aged 111 years old and 295 days.
