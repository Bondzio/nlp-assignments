The "arrondissement" of Pithiviers is the most northern of the "arrondissements" of the Loiret department. It is the smallest "arrondissement" of the department, and the one with fewest people living in it, with 63,280 inhabitants.

It is bordered to the north by the Essonne department, to the east by the Seine-et-Marne department, to the southeast by the "arrondissement" of Montargis, to the south by the "arrondissement" of Orléans and to the west by the Eure-et-Loir department.

After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the "arrondissements" so they could have "communes" that belong to different "arrondissements".
