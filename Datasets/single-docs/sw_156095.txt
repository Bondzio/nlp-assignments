Mishawaka, Indiana

Mishawaka is a city in the state of Indiana, in the United States. It is built on the banks of the St.Joseph River. First settled in the 1830's, in 2000 there were 44,657 people living in the city. The city is named after a native American girl, Princess Mishawaka, the daughter of a Shawnee chief, Elkhart.

The first European settlers came to the area after bog iron was found there in the 1830's. Being near the river, it was a good site for industry which could use river transport. The town was first called St.Joseph Iron Works, after the works which started there in 1833. Shortly after, three other small towns were joined together as the city of Mishawaka.
