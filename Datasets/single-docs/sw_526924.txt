Storyboard

A storyboard is a way of planning animated films, movies, or television shows. A storyboard shows examples of what the artist wants to make before they are animated. It also lets artists organize their stories before they start to make the animation. Storyboarding, in the form it is known today, was developed at Walt Disney Productions. It was first used in the 1928 animated short film, "Plane Crazy"." The 1939 movie "Gone with the Wind" was the first to be completely storyboarded.
