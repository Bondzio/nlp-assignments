Polzeath

Polzeath (pronounced "pol'zeth") is a small seaside resort in the parish of St Minver in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is about six miles (10Â km) north of Wadebridge on the Atlantic coast.

Polzeath is known for its sandy beach and is popular with holiday-makers and surfers. Polzeath beach is described on the RNLI website as : "... a wide, flat beach with some shelter from winds, it sees good quality surf and is quite often extremely crowded". 

The main street through the village runs along the seafront and then rises up steep hills at both ends of the seafront; towards the neighbouring village of Trebetherick to the southwest and towards New Polzeath to the northeast.
