Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art

The museum acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits a collection of art which includes some of the prefecture's most important cultural assets and works by artists with some connection to the region. 

IPMA was first opened in 1959. When the collection outgrew its original building, a new one was built. The current structure was completed in 1983. 

The core of the museum's holdings come from the Maeda family collection which was formerly housed in at the University of Tokyo.
