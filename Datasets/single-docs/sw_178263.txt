UEFA Cup Winners' Cup

The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was an association football club competition which took place every year between winners of all European domestic cup competitions. The first competition was held in the 1960–61 season, and the last in 1998–99. The competition was then abolished to make way for a further expansion to the UEFA Champions League, with domestic cup winners now gaining entry into the UEFA Cup.
