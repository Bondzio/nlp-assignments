Ceratosaurus

Ceratosaurus was a predatory dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic period, 156 to 145 million years ago. It had a large horn on its nose, and a pair of smaller horns in front of its eyes. Uniquely among theropods, "Ceratosaurus" had armor, in the form of small osteoderms running down the middle of its back.
