Medeco

Medeco is a manufacturer of high-security locks. The name Medeco is short for Mechanical Development Company. The Medeco cylinder uses a rotating pin and sidebar design with angled cuts on the keys that rotate the pins, making it more difficult to pick than most other locks, however, it is possible to pick a Medeco lock. In 2006, it was discovered that a set of only four bump keys could open almost any Medeco lock. These keys are referred to as the "Four Keys to the Kingdom" among locksmiths. Medeco is owned by the ASSA ABLOY Group, which also owns Abloy and many other lock manufacturers.
