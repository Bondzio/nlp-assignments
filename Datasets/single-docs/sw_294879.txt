Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)

Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an ongoing series of currently ten books written by Jeff Kinney. It should not be confused with the first book in the series, also called "Diary of a Wimpy Kid". The series is about a middle schooler named Greg Heffley and is written like a diary. Greg sometimes does bad things, but he thinks everyone is mean to him.


Three movies have been made, of the first four books, as "Dog Days" was a mix of "The Last Straw" and "Dog Days" starring Robert Capron (Rowley) and Zachary Gordon (Greg).
