South Africa at the Olympics

South Africa was first at the Olympic Games in 1904, and sent athletes toevery Summer Olympic Games until 1960. After the passage of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761 in 1962 in response to South Africa's policy of apartheid, the nation was barred from the Games. 

After the negotiations to end apartheid in 1990, the nation re-joined the Olympic movement. The "South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee" was formed in 1991, and South Africa returned to the Games at the 1992 Summer Olympics (and the 1992 Summer Paralympics). South Africa was also in the Winter Olympic Games in 1960, and since 1994.
