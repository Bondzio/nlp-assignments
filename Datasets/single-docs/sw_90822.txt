Dystopia

A dystopia is the opposite of a utopia, and can mean a utopia that has become corrupt. This can be seen in George Orwell's book "1984". A dystopia often has many problems, such as poverty, pollution, or a cruel ruler. 

A frequent theme is a place that is supposed to be a beautiful and perfect utopia, but where something unforseen ruins it.
