February 29

February 29 is the 60th day of a leap year in the Gregorian Calendar. It is sometimes called "leap day" or "bissextile day". Only leap years have February 29. This date only occurs every four years, in years that can be exactly divided by 4, such as 1988, 1996, or 2008, except century years that can not be divided by 400 without leaving a remainder, such as 1700, 1800 or 1900.



A person who was born on February 29 may be called a "leapling". In non-leap years they usually celebrate their birthday on February 28 or March 1.

Different countries have different laws about people who are born on February 29. In Taiwan, the law says that the birthday of a leapling is February 28 in years that are not leap years.

The well-known superhero Superman is often said to have his birthday on February 29.
