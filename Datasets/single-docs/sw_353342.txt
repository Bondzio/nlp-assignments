Pop Ya Collar

"Pop Ya Collar" is a song by American singer Usher. It became a lead single from "8701" (2001). The song was leaked on the Internet as part of "All About U", an unreleased album by Usher.

The song reached number 60 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. It was more successful in the United Kingdom where it reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was about an upturned collar. It then became a popular culture "buzzword" at the time.

The catchphrase (or slang) helped the song to be released by other artists. These include "Pop Yo Collar" by MC Hammer (2000) and "Poppin' My Collar" by Three 6 Mafia (2006). However, the word originally came from the Bay Area artist E-40. Hammer's version (featuring Wee Wee) helped make "The Phat Daddy Pop", "In Pop Nito", "River Pop", "Deliver The Pop" and "Pop'n It Up" dance moves.
