Division of Oxley

The Division of Oxley is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was created in 1949 and named after the Australian explorer, John Oxley. Oxley covers the south western suburbs of Brisbane, as well as part of the city of Ipswich. There was an earlier Division of Oxley from 1901â€“1934, which covered a different part of Brisbane.

Its best-known member was Bill Hayden, the Labor Opposition Leader between 1977 and 1983. Hayden became a minister in the Hawke Government and in 1988 was made Governor-General. 

In 1996, Pauline Hanson was selected by the Liberal Party to contest the seat. She lost Liberal support because of her views on migration and Aboriginal issues. The Liberal Party were not able to select another person in time, and Hanson was elected as Liberal, but sat in the House of Representatives as an independent. She formed the right wing One Nation party. After a redistribution in 1997, Hanson unsuccessfully contested the Division of Blair at the 1998 election.
