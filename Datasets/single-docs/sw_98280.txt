Manchu

The Manchu people are a Tungusic people who came from Manchuria (today's Northeastern China). During their rise in the seventeenth century they conquered the Ming Dynasty and founded the Qing Dynasty, which ruled China until the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which established a republican government in its place. 

The Qing Dynasty required by law that all males must wear a hairstyle called the Manchu queue, in which men had to shave the front of their heads and wear a long braid on the back of their heads. 

The Manchu have largely assimilated with the Han Chinese.
