Haloarchaea

Haloarchaea are protists and members of the halophile community. They need a high salt concentrations to grow. They are a distinct evolutionary branch of the Archaea, and are extremophiles.

The term "halobacteria" is a misnomer (mistaken name), because we now know the archaea are a different group from bacteria.

In taxonomy, the Haloarchaea are a class of the Euryarchaeota, found in water with salt. They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt, moisture, and organic material are available.
