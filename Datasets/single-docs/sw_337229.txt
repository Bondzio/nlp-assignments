List of rivers of Italy

This is a list of rivers, which are at least partially in Italy. They are organized according to what body of water they drain into, with the exceptions of Sicily and Sardinia, which are listed separately.





The tributaries of the Po River are organized into right- and left-hand tributaries. The lists are ordered from the river closest to the source of the Po to the river closest to the mouth of the Po.
