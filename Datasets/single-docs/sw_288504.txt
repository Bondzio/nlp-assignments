Glen Matlock

Glen Matlock (Greenford, August 27 1956) is the first bassist of the British punk group Sex Pistols.

He left the group in 1977, because he "liked the Beatles", legend being "thrown out". Matlock was replaced by John Ritchie, also known as Sid Vicious.

In May 2010 it was announced that Matlock would be a member of a reunion of The Faces, scheduled to play at the Vintage at Goodwood festival in London in August 2010.
