Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis

As per his theory , 'all the moving bodies like ocean in the northern hemisphere are deflected towards the right in the Northern Hemisphere and towards the left in Southern Hemisphere because of the Coriolis Force which is called Coriolis effect (Ferell's law )'. It occurs due to centrifugal force .
