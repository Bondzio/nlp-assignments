Hinduism in Bangladesh

Hinduism is the second largest religious affiliation in Bangladesh, covering over at least 16% of the population. In terms of population, the independent nation-state of Bangladesh is the third largest Hindu state of the world after the Republic of India and Nepali states, and hosts the world's largest minority population of Hindus of Bengali ethnic origin.

In nature, Bangladeshi Hinduism closely resembles the forms and customs of Hinduism practised in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, with which Bangladesh (at one time known as East Bengal) was united with that country until the Partition of India in 1947. The river Ganges is a scared holy river which flows into the country from Bharat.
