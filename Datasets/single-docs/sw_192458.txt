Jupiter impact

Several impacts have been seen on the face of Jupiter

In July 1994, a comet broke up into many pieces and then crashed into Jupiter over the course of many days. The comet was called Shoemaker-Levy 9. The largest pieces left scars on the face of Jupiter. Some of the scars were larger than the Earth.

A large impact was observed with the Keck II telescope and its near-infrared camera at Mauna Kea on July 20 11:20 UT. It occurred on the surface of Jupiter.
