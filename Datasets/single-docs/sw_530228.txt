Anti-war movement

An anti-war movement (also "antiwar") is a social movement, usually against to a nation's decision to start or continue a war. It does not matter whether the nation has a just cause for war.

The term can also refer to pacifism, which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts. Many activists distinguish between anti-war movements and peace movements. Anti-war activists work through protest and other peaceful means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict.
