Driver's license

A driver's license, driver license, driver licence, or driving licence is an official document which states that a person may drive a motorized vehicle, such as a motorcycle, car, truck, or a bus.

Different countries have different laws as to whether or not a person can have a driver's license. In some places, a person must pass a driving test before he or she is given a driver's license, while in other places, a driving license is given before the person starts driving.

There are fees to be paid to do the driving tests, and if successful, there are more fees to be paid for the licence. Many people get a Learner's permit before getting a license. The first licence may be a Probationary Licence, which has certain restrictions on what a driver can do. After four years, the driver will qualify for a full, unrestricted licence.
