High fructose corn syrup

High fructose corn syrup (alternate names: glucose-fructose in Canada) is corn syrup whose glucose has been converted to fructose. The conversion produces sweetness of desired types. The material is used in many breads, cereal, sodas, yogurt and breakfast bars.

High fructose corn syrup was first introduced during the late 1950s. The material did not come to the United States until the late 1970s into the 1980s. High fructose corn syrup has been linked to obesity, diabetes and certain other health matters.
