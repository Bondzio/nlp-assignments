Spain at the Olympics

Spain first took part in the Olympic Games in 1900. It has sent athletes to compete in most Summer Olympic Games since 1920. Spain has taken part in every Winter Olympic Games since 1936.

Spain boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany. They also boycotted the 1956 Games in Melbourne because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary. The equestrian events in 1956 took place five months earlier in Stockholm, and Spain did compete in those events.

Spain hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Barcelona was the home city of the International Olympic Committee's president at the time, Juan Antonio Samaranch.

Spanish athletes have won a total of 132 medals. Sailing has given them their largest number of medals in one sport. Spain has only won two medals at the Winter Games. 

The Spanish Olympic Committee ("Comité Olímpico Español") was created in 1924.
