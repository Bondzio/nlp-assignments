Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home

Battersea Dogs & Cats Home is the United Kingdom's oldest and most famous home for dogs and cats. It is in the Battersea area of London, England. The home gets its money from donations. 

Battersea Dogs & Cats Home was started in Holloway in 1860 by Mary Tealby. Its name was Temporary Home for Lost and Starving Dogs. In 1871 it moved to Battersea. Its name was changed because of this. In 1885, Queen Victoria became Patron of the home. The television show "For the Love of Dogs" is mostly filmed at Battersea. There are Battersea centres in Old Windsor, Berkshire and Brands Hatch, Kent as well as in Battersea.

The home has a goal to never turn away a dog or cat in need of help. It reunites lost dogs and cats with their owners. When they can not do this, the home cares for them until a new home can be found for them. It also aims to educate the public about responsible pet ownership.
