Game bird

Game birds are wild birds which are hunted, killed and eaten by humans. It is a sport, and a way of getting food. It happens in most countries, but the details vary. Usually there are laws which govern the hunting. Usually, guns are used, and so there are gun laws. Also, regulations protect the birds' breeding season, so that another generation of birds will grow to replace the present generation.

Although the birds are wild, most of them are "managed" if they live on estates. Of course, birds which migrate cannot be managed in the same way.
