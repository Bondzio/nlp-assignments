It is shown around the world on MTV, and was originally shown on Nickelodeon in countries such as America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and in most of Europe.

People who make cartoons think that "Ren and Stimpy" is famous because John Kricfalusi got fired after only one year of working on his show. He did not do his work on time and often fought with his friends at Nickelodeon. So they fired him. He made other shows but none were as popular as "Ren and Stimpy".

Reruns of "Ren and Stimpy" currently air on the Nicktoons Network.
