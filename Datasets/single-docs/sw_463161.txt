Frank Nighbor

Julius Francis "Pembroke Peach" Nighbor (January 26, 1893 – April 13, 1966) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward. In March 2010, at a Quebec auction, an American collector paid $33,000 USD to secure Frank Nighbor's game-worn Ottawa Senators sweater from the 1926–27 season.

He played for the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey Association (NHA) and Toronto Maple Leafs of the NHL, Toronto Blueshirts of the NHA and Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA).

Nighbor died of cancer on April 13, 1966 in Pembroke, Ontario at the age of 73.
