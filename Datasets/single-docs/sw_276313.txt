Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia

Victor Emmanuel I ("Vittorio Emanuele"; 24 July 1759â€“10 January 1824) was King of Sardinia from 1802 to 1821. 

Born at the Royal Palace of Turin, he was the second son of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonia of Spain. From birth he was known as the Duke of Aosta. His older brother Charles Emmanuel IV abdicated in 1802 and Victor Emmanuel succeeded him. He ruled Sardinia from Cagliari for the next twelve years as the mainland Kingdom of Sardinia had been captured by the French. 

Victor Emmanuel returned to Turin only in 1814, his realm reconstituted by the Congress of Vienna with the addition of the territories of the former Republic of Genoa. After the outbreak of the liberal revolution in his lands in 1821, he abdicated in favor of his brother, Charles Felix. Victor Emmanuel died in the Castle of Moncalieri. He is buried in the Basilica of Superga.

On 21 April 1789, he married Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este, daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Modena.
