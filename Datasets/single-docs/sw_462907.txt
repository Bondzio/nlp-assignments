Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia

Nicholas Romanovich Romanov, Prince of Russia (; 26 September 1922 â€“ 15 September 2014) was a claimant to the headship of the House of Romanov and President of the Romanov Family Association. 

Although he is related to the Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, his claimed titles and official membership in the former Imperial House are disputed by those who maintain that his parents' marriage violated the laws of Imperial Russia.
