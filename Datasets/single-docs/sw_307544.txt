Term (mathematics)

A term is a mathematical expression which may form a separable part of an equation, a series, or another expression.

In elementary mathematics, a "term" is either a single number or variable, or the product of several numbers or variables. Terms are separated by a + or - sign in an overall expression. For example, in

3, 4"x", and 5"yzw" are three separate terms.

In the context of polynomials, "term" can mean a monomial with a coefficient. To 'collect like terms' in a polynomial is the basic operation of making it a linear combination of distinct monomials. For example,

A series is often represented as the sum of a sequence of terms. 

In general mathematical use, however, "term" is not limited to additive expressions.
Individual factors in an expression representing a product are multiplicative terms. Indeed, individual elements of any mathematical expression may be referred to as "terms".

Terms also appear in logic.
