Invasion of Kuwait

The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was a military campaign to occupy Kuwait in the Persian Gulf. Started by Saddam Hussein in 1990 who accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil through slant drilling. In August 2, 1990 Iraq launched 88,000 troops backed up by 750 tanks into Kuwait. Two days after the invasion Kuwait was fully occupied and surrendered. Saddam Hussein made a temporary annexation of Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq. It was not recognized by the United Nations or other countries. 

After the occupation, Iraq took over many of the Kuwaiti oil fields and started taking the oil to keep for Iraq. Factories, businesses and industries were also taken over by Iraqis as well.

After seven months of occupation, the United Nations launched a US led coalition to enter Kuwait to free it from Iraq.
