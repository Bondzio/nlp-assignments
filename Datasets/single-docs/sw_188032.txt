Sachin Tendulkar

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born April 24, 1973 in Mumbai) is a former Indian cricketer. He has the highest number of runs in both Test cricket and One Day Internationals. He also has the highest number of centuries in both formats of the game. His last Test match being played against the West Indies.

Tendulkar scored his much awaited 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012 against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup. He became the first person in history to achieve this feat. Incidentally, it was Tendulkar's first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for meÂ ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."
