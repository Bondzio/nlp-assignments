Kyushu-Palau Ridge

Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR) is an ocean floor feature in the Philippine Sea. It is named after the nearby islands. At the northern end is the Japanese island of Kyushu. At the southern end is the Pacific island nation of Palau.

The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900Â km from the eastern end of the or ""Bungo" strait" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southeast in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.

KPR is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu.

KBR was created by movement at the northern edges of the Philippine Plate.
