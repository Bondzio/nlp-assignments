Garth Brooks is the eponymous debut studio album of American country music artist Garth Brooks, released on April 12, 1989 through Capitol Nashville. It was both a critical and chart success, peaking at #13 on the "Billboard" 200. On the Top Country Albums chart the album peaked at #2 for eight weeks behind Clint Black's Killin' Time. In 2006 "Garth Brooks" was certified Diamond by the RIAA for shipments of 10 million copies in the US.

This album contains Brooks' earliest hits, for instance his first ever single, "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)", which peaked at #8 on the Country Billboard Charts in 1989. It put the name of an independent cowboy singer, Chris LeDoux, into the mainstream due to the lyric ""The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux"" Two other strong starts include his first #1, "If Tomorrow Never Comes" and the Academy of Country Music's 1990 Song of the Year and Video of the Year, "The Dance" (another #1).
