Brunei at the Olympics

Brunei, as "Brunei Darussalam", was first at the Olympic Games in 1988, with a single official but no athletes. The nation was in the Summer Olympic Games in 1996, 2000 and 2004. Each time it was represented by a single athlete. Brunei has never been in the Winter Olympic Games. They have never won an Olympic medal.

As of 2010 Brunei, along with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, was one of only three countries to have never sent a female athlete to the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee in 2010 announced it would "press" these countries to allow women's participation.

The National Olympic Committee for Brunei was formed in 1984 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year.
