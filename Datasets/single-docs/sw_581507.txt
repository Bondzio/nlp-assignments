April 2017 Champs-Élysées attack

On 20 April 2017, three police officers were shot by an assailant with a Kalashnikov rifle on the Champs-Élysées, a shopping street in Paris, France. One was killed and two others, along with another person, were seriously injured before the attacker was killed. An accomplice in the attack was also identified. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has claimed responsibility.

President François Hollande called for an emergency security meeting at the Élysée Palace. He later released a statement saying French authorities were "convinced" the shooting was a suspected terrorist attack. Following the shooting, US President Donald Trump, who was holding a press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at the time, expressed his condolences to the people of France and said, "[W]e have to be strong and we have to be vigilant."
