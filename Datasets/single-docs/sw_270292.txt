Atlantic sturgeon

The Atlantic sturgeon ("Acipenser sturio") is a member of the Acipenseridae family. It is one of the oldest fish species in the world. It can be found from New Brunswick, Canada to the eastern coast of Florida. The numbers of Atlantic sturgeon have fallen because of overfishing and water pollution. It is considered threatened, endangered and even extinct in much of its original habitats. The fish live to 60 years of age, 15 feet in length and over 800 pounds in weight.
