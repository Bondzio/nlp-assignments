Volga Germans

Volga Germans ( or "Russlanddeutsche", , "Povolzhskie nemtsy") were ethnic Germans living along the Volga River. They kept the culture, language, traditions and religions of Germans, including Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism.

Catherine the Great invited Germans to immigrate. She gave them Russian lands, and allowed them to keep their language and culture.

The Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic of the Volga Germans (; ) existed from 1924 to 1942 with the capital in Engels. 

Germans from Russia also settled in Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. Most Volga Germans who settled in Latin America were Catholic. Many Catholic Volga Germans chose South America as their new homeland because the nations in South America shared their religion.
