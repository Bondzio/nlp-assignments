Port Authority Police

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, or Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), is a police department in New York and New Jersey. It protects all the property owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and it enforces state and city laws. The PAPD is one of the largest police departments in the United States, with 1,660 members. The PAPD is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a two-state agency that runs the bridges, tunnels, airports, and seaports along the New York - New Jersey border.

On February 26, 1993 the Port Authority's World Trade Center was the target of a terrorist attack, and of the more successful September 11 attacks in 2001.

The area had over 50,000 employees and 70,000 visitors per day; the work of emergency personnel including the Port Authority Police, the New York City Police Department, the New York City Fire Department, New York City EMS, New York State Court Officers, Federal Agents and many others helped to lower the deaths from the attack. The Port Authority Police had the biggest loss of police personnel at a single time in American history: 37 police officers along with one police dog were killed on September 11th.
