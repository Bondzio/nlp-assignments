Pelagornis

Pelagornis is a genus of huge fossil birds. One species, "P. sandersi", is one of the largest bird ever found. Its wingspan was twice that of the largest Albatross. Its wingspan is estimated as about 6.4 to 7.4 metres. The fossil of this particular species is from the Oligocene stage, about 25 million years ago (mya).

Pelagornithids are an extinct group of birds known for bony tooth-like beak projections, large size, and highly modified wing bones. There are many questions about their ecology. The bird was capable of highly efficient gliding. That suggests it had a long-range marine soaring life-style similar to that of living albatrosses.

Several later species have been found, and they are not quite so large. The whole group died out about three million years ago.
