The Adour river is born, as Adour de Payolle, at the north side of the Arbizon mountain. In the Campan valley, that is formed by three smaller valleys corresponding to the sources of the three "Adours" ("Adour de Payolle", "Adour de Gripp" and the "Adour de Lesponne"), these small rivers meet at Campan (Arrondissement of Bagnères-de-Bigorre) to form the Adour river.

The Adour flows north for almost a hundred miles through the Hautes-Pyrénées to Gers. There, it turned to the west and gets into the Landes department. In Port-de-Lanne, the Adour is joined by the Gaves réunis river and, finally, it flows into the Bay of Biscay, in the Atlantic Ocean, between Anglet (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) and Tarnos (Landes).
