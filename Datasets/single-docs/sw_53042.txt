Soft drink

Soft drinks (also known as pop, soda, tonic, soda pop, fizzy drinks, or minerals ) are carbonated drinks made from concentrates and sugar. Some have flavors. Some popular types of soda are Sprite, Mountain Dew, 7 Up, Pepsi, Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola. Most soft drinks are sweetened with sugar, that is what makes them so unhealthy.
