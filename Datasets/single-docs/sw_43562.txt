Impeachment

Impeachment is a way to remove government officers from office in some countries. It happens when the official does not want to leave his or her job. It is like an indictment (something that the prosecutor needs to get before the trial). Someone is impeached when a legislature votes to do that. Later, there is another vote on whether or not to convict, which is like guilty. The second vote may be by the same people who did the impeachment, or someone else as in a bicameral legislature. Several kinds of office holder may impeached, but cases against a President attract much attention.

Two famous heads of state who were recently impeached and removed from office were Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and South Korean president Park Geun-hye.
