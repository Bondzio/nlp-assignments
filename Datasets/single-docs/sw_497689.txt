Arrondissements of the Lot-et-Garonne department

There are 4 arrondissements in the Lot-et-Garonne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.

Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes.
