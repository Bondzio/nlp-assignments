Great Ireland Run

The Great Ireland Run is an 10-kilometre road running competition which is held in Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland in mid-April. It is held every year since 2003. 

It is part of the Great Run series of athletics competitions. It has IAAF Bronze Label Road Race status. It is sponsored by SPAR and features both an elite race ("for sportspeople") and a popular race ("for the general public"). There is also a 2.5 km fun run for 8–15-year-old runners.

The 10 km race course begins at Chesterfield Avenue. It goes around in a clock-wise route to finish on Furze Road. Over 10,000 people took part in the day's events in 2011. 

People who have run the race include former marathon world record holder Paul Tergat, and World Championship medallist Meselech Melkamu, as well as some of Ireland's foremost athletes such as 1995 World Champion Sonia O'Sullivan and cross country specialist Catherina McKiernan.
