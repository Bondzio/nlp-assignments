South African Grand Prix

The South African Grand Prix was first run as a Grand Prix motor racing handicap race in 1934 at the Prince George Circuit at East London, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. 

The races were stopped because of World War II. It was started again in 1962 as part of the Formula One circuit. It was a popular F1 event. It was stopped again after the 1985 race. Some nations began boycotting (not participating) South African events because of racial segregation policy of apartheid. 

After apartheid was ended in 1991, there were two more races held in 1992 and 1993.
