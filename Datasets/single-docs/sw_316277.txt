Sejo of Joseon

Joseon Sejo (; September 29 1417 – September 8 1468) was the Korean Joseon Dynasty's seventh king (1455 – 1468). He was the second son of Sejong the Great.

In 1429 his peerage was Grand Prince Sooyang. When his father Sejong the Great died in 1450, his elder brother Munjong was crowned. Two years later Munjong died, and Munjong's son Danjong was crowned.

In 1455, he produced a coup d'état and became king of Joseon himself. Sejo's nephew Danjong was expelled after he was murdered in 1455.
