Terra (mythology)

Terra is the Roman form of Gaia (greek). She is the goddess of the Earth. Her husband is Caelus, an ancient god of the sky (heavens). They are the parents of the Titans & giants. One day, thousands of years ago, Terra convinced her son, Saturn, to take his father's scythe and chop his father up with it. Saturn did as his mother told him. He scattered Caelus's pieces across the cosmos. When one piece hit the water, it gave birth to Venus, the goddess of love. This, effectively, makes Venus the oldest of all the gods & goddess'.
