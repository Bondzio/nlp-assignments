Hurricane Ophelia (2005)

Hurricane Ophelia was a long-lived Atlantic hurricane which is mostly remembered for its very erratic and slow track off the United States' East Coast in September 2005. This storm brushed eastern North Carolina on September 14 and 15, 2005, causing $70 million in damages. Minor damage was also reported in eastern New England and Atlantic Canada when Ophelia brushed them as a strong tropical storm.
