Aichi S1A

The Aichi S1A "Denko" (Bolt of Light) was a Japanese night fighter aircraft. 

The Aichi S1A was intended to replace the Nakajima J1N1-S "Gekkou" ("Irving"), used during the Second World War. The aircraft was not completed before the war ended. Two prototypes were made in 1945. The project was cancelled after the prototypes were destroyed during bomb attacks.
