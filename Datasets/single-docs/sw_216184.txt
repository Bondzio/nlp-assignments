Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat

Sagwa is the name of a siamese cat in the children's book "Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat" by author Amy Tan. Sagwa's popularity with children prompted an educational animated series of the same name on PBS Kids. In the series, which is set circa 1900 during the Qing Dynasty, Sagwa has fun in her day-to-day life while learning and teaching valuable life lessons. The show is notable for its setting and messages about family and loyalty.
