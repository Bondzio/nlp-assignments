Mario J. Molina

Mario J. Molina (born March 19, 1943) is a Mexican chemist who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995.

He is the first Mexican to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Molina led a committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science which released a stark report on global warming March 2014.
