Clandestine cell system

A clandestine cell system is a way of organising a group of three to five people so that it is kept secret. This is so the group are better able to resist infiltration or discovery by an enemy. If a person only knows the others in his cell, then he cannot betray the others outside of his or her cell, either accidentally, or under interrogation. The cell can range from a strict hierarchy of people to a team of people. It is used by spy agencies, criminal organisations and guerilla groups.
