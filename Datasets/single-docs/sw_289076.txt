Mechanical Animals

Mechanical Animals is the third studio album by American rock band, Marilyn Manson. It was released on September 14, 1998. The producers of the album were Michael Beinhorn, Marilyn Manson and Sean Beavan. The album received controversy from Wal-Mart because of the album's artwork which features Manson covered from head to toe in latex paint. His genitals are covered by a thin cup of plastic that creates the androgynous appearance of an alien figure that he calls "OmÄ“ga".
