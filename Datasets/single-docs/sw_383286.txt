Wheatfield with Crows

Wheatfield with Crows is an oil painting by Vincent van Gogh. It was finished about the 10th July 1890 (van Gough died on the 29th July 1890). In 1890, Van Gogh wrote that he had made three paintings in Auvers-sur-Oise of large fields of wheat under troubled skies. "Wheat Field with Crows" was one of them. It is almost certainly not the last painting of his life. This painting in particular is often thought to reflect his state of mind towards the end of his life.
