Division of Swan

The Division of Swan is an Australian electoral division located in Western Australia. The division is named after the Swan River.

It was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. Historically, the electorate was a country seat extending north to Dongara, east to Merredin and south to the coast. New boundaries created a smaller area east of the Darling Range. The old area became the new seat of Moore, while Swan moved to its present position.

It covers the suburbs of Ascot, Beckenham, Belmont, Bentley, Burswood, Cannington, Carlisle, Cloverdale, Como, East Cannington, East Victoria Park, Ferndale, Karawara, Kensington, Kewdale, Langford, Lathlain, Lynward, Manning, Queens Park, Redcliffe, Rivervale, Salter Point, St James, South Perth, Victoria Park, Waterford, Welshpool and Wilson.

Sir John Forrest had been the Premier of Western Australia. His death in 1918 led to a by-election in 1918. Kim Beazley served as a Minister in the Bob Hawke Government. He became Leader of the Opposition from 1996 to 2001, and from 2005 to 2006. He was also Deputy Prime Minister in 1995 and 1996. After retiring from politics he became the Australian Ambassador to the United States.
