Battle of the Plains of Abraham

The Battle of the Plains of Abraham was a battle that happened on September 13, 1759. It was part of the French and Indian War, which was part of the big Seven Years' War. The Plains of Abraham is close to the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec City. It is named after Abraham Martin. The battle was the French against the British. The French leader was Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, and the British leader was James Wolfe. Both were young men. The French were wearing blue and the British were wearing red. 

The French were in their fort on the Plains of Abraham, waiting for the British to arrive. They knew the British were coming, from rumors and spies. But when the British arrived, the French were not prepared, and they did not have all their troops with them. They attacked anyway; each side had about 4500 troops. Many of the French troops that were at the battle were not trained as well as the British troops. Montcalm and Wolfe both died. The French retreated, and Quebec surrendered on September 18, 1759. The war continued in 1760, and the British captured Montreal and New France was defeated.
