Ghee

Ghee is a product made from butter. It is used in Indian and Pakistani cookings as a form of oil or cooking fat. It is made by boiling butter until all the water has evaporated out and the milk solids have settled to the bottom. Ghee can be made out of many different kinds of milk like cow, sheep, and buffalo milk. Ghee aged 10 to 100 years, called Kumbhiighrta, is believed to have medicinal properties.
