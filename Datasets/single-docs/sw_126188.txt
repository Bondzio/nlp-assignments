Monarch Airlines

Monarch Airlines is a budget airline which is based in the United Kingdom. It was created on 5 June 1967. Its first flight was on 5 April 1968 from Luton in England to Madrid in Spain. Monarch now flies to many different places around the world, and usually to holiday resorts.

Monarch's fleet consists of 30 aircraft: 4 Airbus A300 aircraft, 5 Airbus A320 aircraft, 16 Airbus A321 aircraft, 2 Airbus A330 aircraft and 3 Boeing 757 aircraft.

Monarch had ordered 6 Boeing 787 aircraft which were due to be delivered in 2013. They have now cancelled their order.

Monarch Airlines has had 2 accidents. Nobody was killed. On 22 May 2002, one of Monarch's Boeing 757s suffered broken landing gear at Gibraltar Airport because the pilot pushed the front wheels down too hard on landing.

On 17 March 2006, the flightdeck crew of a Boeing 757-200 lost visual contact with the runway while attempting to land at Gibraltar Airport. During the subsequent go-around, the crew nearly crashed into the Rock of Gibraltar. The aircraft diverted to Malaga to prevent a similar problem.
