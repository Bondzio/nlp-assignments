Predator X

Predator X is a giant species of pliosaur discovered in 2006 by Norwegian scientist, Jorn Hurum. The skull was dug up in 2008 and told a lot about this animal. As far as scientists are concerned this animal had a bite force that was 4 times more powerful than that of a Tyrannosaurus and had a bite force 10 times more powerful than any modern giant predators today like the saltwater crocodile and the great white shark. From what scientists could gather this animal could lift a car in its mouth and crush it completely. This creature measured 49 feet long and weighed 99,000 pounds (49.5 tons). It lived about 147 million years ago and its remains were discovered in the Arctic.
