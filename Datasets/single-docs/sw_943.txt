Yiddish

Yiddish is a language used by some Jews. At first it was a dialect of the German language which Jews began to use in Europe about a thousand years ago. It was (and is) used in the United States, especially in New York, and other countries where Jews have migrated to. Most of its words are of German origin. Also, Yiddish has many words from Hebrew and Slavic languages, notably Polish. It also contains some French, Hungarian, and Latin words. Yiddish is usually written in Hebrew characters.

In the whole world, Yiddish is spoken by about 3 million people. It is mainly spoken by Hasidic Jews.

In the Netherlands and Sweden, Yiddish is protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
