Hurricane Igor

Hurricane Igor was a destructive tropical cyclone which passed by Bermuda and struck the Island of Newfoundland. This storm was a powerful Category Four hurricane with winds as high as 155 miles per hour. Igor brushed Bermuda as a minor hurricane with minimal damage. In Newfoundland, however, the storm caused $200 million in damage, making Igor the most destructive Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to strike the region. The name Igor was retired and replaced by Ian for the 2016 Atlantic season.
