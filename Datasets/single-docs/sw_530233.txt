Insubordination

Insubordination is when people do not obey an authority. In the military, for example, insubordination is when a serviceman or servicewoman disobeys the orders of a higher-ranking officer.

A person may refuse to obey a law or order that he or she thinks is wrong. This is called civil disobedience.
