Armenia-Turkey relations

Armenia and Turkey's relations have been strained for a number of years mostly concerning the Nagorno-Karabakh area and Armenias claim of genocide by the Ottoman Empire. Turkey also has taken a stand for Azerbaijan in their conflict. However, on October 10, 2009 both Turkey and Armenia signed an accord that aimed to lead to a new relationship between the two countries and an opening of the borders. However, those diplomatic efforts to ease the relations have stopped, as Armenia suspended the process.
