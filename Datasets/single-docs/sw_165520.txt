Crying

Crying is when tears come out of a person's eyes because of their emotions, such as when they are sad, angry, or very happy.

Animals cannot cry. However, animals can release tears for other reasons, such as intense pain. 

When over 300 adults were asked how often they cried, they found out that men usually cry once every month, and women cry five or more times per month.
