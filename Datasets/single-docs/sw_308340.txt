Windows To Go

Windows To Go is a feature in Windows 8 and later that allows the entire system to run from a USB flash drive or external USB Hard Drive.

In September 2011 Microsoft officially announced Windows To Go at the Build Conference, and gave out bootable USB Flash drives. These could hold 32GB of information. They also had Windows To Go pre-installed.
