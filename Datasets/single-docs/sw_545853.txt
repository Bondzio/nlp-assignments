The Sweet Escape (song)

"The Sweet Escape" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her second studio album of the same name (2006). It was written by Stefani, Akon, and Giorgio Tuinfort. Akon was featured on the song and also produced and created the songs beat. As both Stefani and Akon wrote the song, Stefani was surprised how the song ended up as it was a doo-wop song and not a hip hop song.
