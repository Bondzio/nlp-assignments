Mayfair

Mayfair (first called The May Fair) is an area in central London. It is in the city of Westminster.

Mayfair is named after the annual fortnight-long "May Fair" that happened in a place that is Shepherd Market today (from 1686 until it was banned at that place in 1764). Until 1686, the May Fair was held in Haymarket, and after 1764, it moved to Fair Field in Bow.

Mayfair was bordered by Hyde Park to the west, Oxford Street to the north, Piccadilly to the south and Bond Street to the east, although the eastern boundary has been made longer recently, so now it goes all the way to Regent Street. Most of the area was first made between the mid 17th century and the mid 18th century.

The district is mostly commercial now. It has many offices in houses and new buildings. The price of rents in Mayfair are some of the highest in London and the world. There is still a large amount of houses as well as some exclusive shopping and London's largest amount of luxury hotels and many restaurants. Some buildings in Mayfair are:

The City of Westminster uses the Mayfair Library as a local library.

St. Nicholas College of London has lessons in English and other languages for people who live in and visit Mayfair.
