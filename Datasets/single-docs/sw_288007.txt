Long pepper

Long pepper, or Indonesian long pepper, is a flowering vine in the family "Piperaceae", known for its fruit, which is usually dried and used as a spice.

Today, long pepper is a very rare ingredient in European cuisines, but it can still be found in Indian vegetable pickles, some North African spice mixtures, and in Indonesian and Malaysian cooking.
