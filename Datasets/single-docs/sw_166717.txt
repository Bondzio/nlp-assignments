Burglary

Burglary is a crime. A person who does a burglary is called a burglar. In a burglary, the burglar breaks into a place (like another person's house or car) with the goal of stealing something.

Burglary happens more often in poor communities than rich communities.

Normally they do it at night time and when nobody is in the house.

People can also do it in stores and banks.

The word "burglar" comes from the Old English words "burg" ("house") and "laron" ("thief").
