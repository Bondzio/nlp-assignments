Trichomonas gallinae

The protozoan Trichomonas gallinae is a cosmopolitan parasite found in birds. It most often infects pigeons and doves, but can also affect other birds such as domestic and wild turkeys, chickens and birds of prey. The disease in pigeons is commonly called canker. A similar parasite in falcons is called "frounce".
