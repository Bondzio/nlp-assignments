G. K. Chesterton

G. K. Chesterton (in full Gilbert Keith Chesterton; 1874â€“1936) was an English author and critic who wrote a large and varied amount of works, including essays, poems, novels, short stories and more. He is perhaps best remembered today for his delightfully mysterious yet humorous Father Brown stories, based on his very popular, imaginary priest-detective.
