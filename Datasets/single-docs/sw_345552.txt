37th G8 summit

The 37th G8 summit was held 26–27 May 2011 in the commune of Deauville in France.
The Deauville summit of the Group of Eight (G8) was the 37th meeting in a series which began in 1976.

For some, the G8 summit became a profit-generating event. For example, the "G8 Summit" magazines have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998.
