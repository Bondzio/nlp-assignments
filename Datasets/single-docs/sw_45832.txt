Hanna-Barbera

Hanna-Barbera was a company that made cartoon television programs and movies. Some of these cartoons were "Tom and Jerry", "Spike and Tyke", "The Jetsons", "The Flintstones", "Scooby-Doo", "Yogi Bear", "Smurfs", "Pink Panther", "Wally Gator", and "Peter Potamus", as well as the 1973 movie version of "Charlotte's Web". It was started by and named after William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. After the death of Hanna in 2001, Hanna-Barbera split into two parts: Warner Bros. Animation (for older cartoons) and Cartoon Network Studios (for the newer ones on Cartoon Network).

Hanna-Barbera Studios had many cartoon programs on the air for over four decades. This studio competed with Disney, and Warner Bros to produce the best cartoons.
