Ed Whitlock

Ed Whitlock (March 6, 1931 â€“ March 13, 2017) was an English-born Canadian long-distance runner. He is the first person over 70 years old to run a marathon in less than three hours with a time of 2:59:10 in 2003.

Whitlock, who ran as a teenager and took up the sport again in his forties, first became the oldest person to run a marathon in less than 3 hours in 2000, at the age of 69, with a time of 2:52:47.
