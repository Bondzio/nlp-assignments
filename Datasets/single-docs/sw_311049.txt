Postgenderism

Postgenderism is a movement and the idea to get rid of gender in humans.

Postgenderism argues that grouping genders into different groups and gender roles are not needed and a limitation on the possibilities of people and what they can achieve in life.

It foresees that gender will disappear with humans that don't want this, as a result of always changing ways the human species organises their lives and as a result of new technology advances.
