English people

English people sometimes live in England, which is one of the nations of the island of Great Britain, which they share with Scottish people and the Welsh. Originally they were descended from Anglo-Saxons and Normans, but, nowadays they are descended from immigrants from all over Europe as well as from the rest of the World, notably from Former British colonies, like India, Pakistan, USA, Belize and South Africa, for example.
