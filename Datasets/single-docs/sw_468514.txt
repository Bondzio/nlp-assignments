Cheese mite

Cheese mites are mites which live in food, grain and plant leaves. 

They are sometimes found in flour but prefer cheese. Refrigerated cheese is not usually affected as they prefer warm, damp foods. Cheese mites are used to make certain cheeses. Milbenkäse and Mimolette are two examples. The action of the mites on the surface of these cheeses adds to the flavor. It also gives them a distinctive appearance. A 2010 SEM study found that Milbenkäse cheese was produced using "Tyrolichus casei" mites, while Mimolette cheese used "Acarus siro" mites (also known as flour mites).
