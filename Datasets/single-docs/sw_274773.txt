Babirusa

The babirusas are a genus Babyrousa, in the pig family (Suidae) found in Wallacea, or specifically the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru. All members of this genus were considered part of a single species until recently the babirusa ("B. babyrussa"), but following the split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa is named "B. celebensis". The name "pig-deer" has sometimes also been used in English, and is a direct translation of the Indonesian babi-rusa.
