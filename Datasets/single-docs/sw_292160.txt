Physiotherapy

Physiotherapy, also called physical therapy, is used to treat pain by using methods such as interferential therapy, ultrasonic, short wave diathermy, wax therapy, and muscle strengthening exercises. 

Physiotherapy plays an important role in the recovery of stroke patients. It also plays a major role in treating children with cerebral palsy, and in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation.

Physiotherapy has three main categories which are orthopedics, neurophysiotherapy, and cardiorespiratory physiotherapy.
