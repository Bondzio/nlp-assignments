Law &amp; Order: LA

Law & Order: LA was an American television police drama. It was a spin-off of "Law & Order", being the fourth spin-off. It ran on NBC from October 18, 2010 to July 11, 2011. It is the only American "Law & Order" show to be set outside of New York City, being set in Los Angeles.

"Law & Order: LA" followed the same format as "Law & Order". The first half of the show showed the crime, the police looking for the suspect, and the suspect being arrested (the "Law" part). The second part of the show showed the trial and whether or not the suspect did the crime (the "Order" part). The show was adapted to fit the Los Angeles criminal justice system.
