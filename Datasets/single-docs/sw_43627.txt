Endometrium

The endometrium is the innermost membrane of the uterus in mammals. During pregnancy, the endometrium develops a lot of glands and capillaries. These all become interconnected and form a placenta when a fertilised ovum attaches itself to the uterus. The capillaries supply the fetus with nutrients; they also take away waste products such as carbon dioxide.
