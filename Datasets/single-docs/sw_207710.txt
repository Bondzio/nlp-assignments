List of Russian surnames

This list is there to help find pages (that no other pages link to) of "family names" (surnames) of people in the Russian Federation.

This is different from a list of surnames that came from Russia as there are people living in there with very many ethnic roots. Because of this there are surnames from many places of the ex-USSR, Europe, and Asia. This list also shows in the Simple English Wikipedia to show pages about family names that may need to be created. If you or your relatives live in Russia, add your surname to the list if it is not there.

It is also very possible on the Simple English Wikipedia that the spelled versions of the names can be the same as some equivalent common Slavic surnames of Ukrainians, Belorusians, Bulgarians, and others.
