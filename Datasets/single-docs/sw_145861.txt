Magic Tour

The Magic Tour was the biggest and last tour by the English rock band Queen with their lead singer Freddie Mercury. The tour started in Sweden on 7 June 1986. It ended in England on 9 August 1987. The next band's tour Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour began about 19 years later, after the death of Freddie Mercury and the retirement of John Deacon. The tour included performances on 26 dates at Europe's stadiums. It was in support of their album "A Kind of Magic".

In 1987, Mercury was diagnosed with HIV. The band together made the decision to stop touring. This made the concert at Knebworth on 9 August the last time the four members of Queen would perform onstage together.
