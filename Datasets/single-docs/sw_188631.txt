Wood Street railway station

Wood Street railway station is in Walthamstow. It is a part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest in north east London. It is in Travelcard Zone 4. It was opened in 1873.

When the Victoria line was being planned, this station was going to be the end of the line instead of Walthamstow Central station. A decision was made in 1961 though which meant that this did not happen. If this station had become the end of the Victoria line the building would have been on the surface next to the British Railways station.
