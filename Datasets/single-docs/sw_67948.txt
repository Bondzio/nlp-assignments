Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness is a moral value considered to be a virtue. A trustworthy person is someone in whom we can place our trust and be sure that the trust will not be betrayed.

In order for one to trust another, their worth and integrity must be proven over time.
Trustworthiness, identified by specific attributes such as reliability and dependability, is vital because it is an umbrella under which we protect ourselves from stormy weather. Each one of us needs to have at least one such umbrella for protection--if not a trustworthy friend or relative, at least classmates with whom we can talk and know that our words will go no further. We need to trust that teachers and fellow students will adhere to the Lifelong Guidelines. Likewise, we need to be the umbrella of protection for other people by providing confidentiality, steadiness, and support during those occasional drizzles, steady rains, and torrential downpours that life presents.
