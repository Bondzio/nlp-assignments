Der Stürmer

Der Stürmer was a weekly newspaper published from 1923 to 1945. It contained propaganda for the policies of the Nazi Party in Germany. It was styled like a tabloid. It printed obscene antisemitic material with the intent to make people hate Jews. This included racist caricatures, accusations of blood libel and sex crimes, and articles about why Jews are a problem.

The paper was published by Julius Streicher. It was first printed in Nuremberg on 20 April 1923. This was at a time when Adolf Hitler was trying to seize power and control over the government. "Der Stürmer" continued to be published until the end of World War II. After the war, Streicher was executed for authorising the publication of articles that demanded the extermination of the Jewish race.
