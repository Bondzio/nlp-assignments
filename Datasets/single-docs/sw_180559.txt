Pork barrel

Pork barrel is the appropriation of government spending for localized projects that are secured primarily to bring money to a representative's district. The usage originated in American English. It was a reference to the custom of slave owners giving a gift of Salt pork in a barrel to their slaves. In election campaigns, the term is used in a negative way to attack opponents. However, scholars use it as a technical term regarding legislative control of local appropriations.
