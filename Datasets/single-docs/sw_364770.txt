Archibald Gracie IV

Colonel Archibald Gracie IV (January 17, 1859 â€“ December 4, 1912) was an American writer, amateur historian, real estate investor, and survivor of the sinking of the R.M.S Titanic. He survived the sinking by climbing aboard an overturned lifeboat. He wrote a popular book about the disaster which is still in print today.

Gracie was born on January 17, 1959 in Mobile, Alabama and studied at St. Paul's School. He was never married.

Gracie was saved during the sinking of the Titanic when he got onto a lifeboat. Then as the ship started to sink, his life boat was sucked underwater. Gracie and his friend Clinch Smith were under the ship when Gracie was freed from the ship's current and began to swin towards a collapsed lifeboat. His friend Clinch never reached the surface and his remains were never found.

Gracie died on December 4, 1912 from diabetes in New York City, New York, aged 53. He died just 8 months after the sinking, making him the first upper class Titanic survivor to die. Gracie's last words were "We must get them into the boats. We must get them all into the boats."
