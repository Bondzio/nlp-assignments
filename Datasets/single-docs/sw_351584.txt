Japan state carriages

Japan state carriages are horse-drawn coaches. The carriages are used in Imperial events. 

The carriages are in regular use. For example, during the presentation of credentials of a newly appointed ambassador, it sometimes happens that the ambassador will be driven to the south portico of the Imperial Palace in a horse-drawn carriage. The carriages called "zagyoshiki" are drawn by two horses 

A few carriages are only used rarely. For example, some state carriages are part of ceremonies of enthronement and the marriages of members of the Imperial Family.

In December 1923, there was an assassination attempt on the life of Crown Prince Hirohito. He was in a carriage on his way to the opening of the 48th Session of the Imperial Diet. A small pistol was fired at the Imperial carriage. The bullet injured a chamberlain, but Hirohito was unharmed.
