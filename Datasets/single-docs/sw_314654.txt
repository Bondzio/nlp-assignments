Pope Urban VI

Pope Urban VI (; c. 1318 â€“ October 15, 1389), born Bartolomeo Prignano, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 203rd Pope from 1378 to 1389.

Prignano was born in Naples. 

In 1364, Prignano was made the Archbishop of Acerenza by Pope Urban V.

Pope Gregory XI made Prignano Archbishop of Bari in 1377.

He was not a cardinal. There were several Popes who were not Cardinals. One of these was Pope Urban V.

Prignano was elected pope on April 8, 1378; and he chose to be called Pope Urban VI. 

A period called the "Western Schism" began on 20 September 20, 1378 when Robert of Geneva (also known as Clement VII) was chosen pope by 13 French cardinals. Clement VII is now considered to have been an antipope. 

A large part of Germany, Flanders, Italy (with exception of Naples), England and Ireland recognized Urban VI as the pope; but many in Western Europe supported the papacy of Clement VII.
