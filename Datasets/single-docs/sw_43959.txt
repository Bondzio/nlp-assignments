Thrud

Þrúðr, sometimes written as Thrúd, is a daughter of the gods Sif and Thor in Norse mythology. Although her name is mentioned in the "Prose Edda", it gives no direct powers or other information about her. Thrúd is also one of the valkyries described in "Grímnismál" (stanza 36). Thrúd is the goddess of the heath, of willows, of trees, flowers and the grass. Her name means strength in Old Norse.
