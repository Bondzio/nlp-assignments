Survivor Series (2016)

Survivor Series (2016) was a wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) made by WWE for the "Raw" and "SmackDown Live" brands. It happened on November 20, 2016. It happened at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the thirtieth time a Survivor Series PPV was held and the first to be held in Canada after the Montreal Screwjob in 1997.

Eight wrestling matches were performed at the event. In the most important match, Goldberg beat Brock Lesnar in one minute and 26 seconds in his first match in 12 years. In addition, there were three Survivor Series matches between the wrestlers of "Raw" and "SmackDown".

At WrestleMania XX, Goldberg beat Brock and the next day, both men left WWE. Brock wrestled in New Japan Pro Wrestling, fought in Ultimate Fighting Championship and returned to WWE in April 2012 but Goldberg hardly wrestled again. In 2016, the covers and commercials for the WWE 2K17 video game were shown for the first time and Goldberg was on/in both of them. This made many people think that he would return to WWE and maybe get a rematch with Brock. The two started talking about the match they could have at conventions like the ones for the video game. In October 2017, Paul Heyman said Brock was challenging Goldberg because he was the one wrestler Brock could never beat. That month, Goldberg returned and agreed to fight Brock. 

To start the match, Brock pushed Goldberg into the corner and rammed him between the ropes but Goldberg pushed him back hard and Brock fell back. When Brock got up, he took a spear from Goldberg. This happened again and then Goldberg picked Brock up and performed a Jackhammer and won the match.

 Natalya replaced Nikki Bella, who was attacked backstage before the match.
