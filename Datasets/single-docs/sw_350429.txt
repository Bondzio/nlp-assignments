Carolingian Empire

Carolingian Empire (800â€“888) is a historiographical term for the realm of the Franks under the Carolingian dynasty in the Early Middle Ages. This dynasty is seen as the founders of France and Germany. Its beginning date is based on the crowning of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, and ends with the death of Charles the Fat. This Empire can be seen as the later history of the Frankish Realm or the early history of France and of the Holy Roman Empire.
