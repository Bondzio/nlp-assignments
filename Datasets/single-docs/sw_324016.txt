Walt Whitman

Walter "Walt" Whitman (May 31, 1819 â€“ March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist and journalist. He was an important American poet of the 19th century. 

His most famous collection of poems is "Leaves of Grass", which was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person. Whitman kept adding to this book right up until he died of pneumonia, in 1892. It was controversial because readers thought it was obscene. It included some sexuality.

Whitman was either bisexual or homosexual. However, there is disagreement about whether Whitman had actual sexual experiences with men. 

Whitman was deeply influenced by deism. He denied any one faith was more important than another, and embraced all religions equally.
