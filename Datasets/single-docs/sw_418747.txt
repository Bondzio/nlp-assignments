Wine (bishop)

Wine or Wini ( before 672) was a 7th century Bishop. He was the first Bishop of Winchester. He later became the Bishop of London.

Wine had been ordained in Gaul. In Wessex King Cenwalh of Wessex had grown tired of his current bishop, Agilbert, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Wine did speak Anglo-Saxon and was invited by Cenwalh to come to Wessex. Cenwalh built a new church at Winchester; dividing his kingdom into two dioceses. There, Wine was the first bishop of Winchester in 660. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and returned to Gaul. King Oswiu of Northumbria appointed a monk named Chad to be bishop to the Northumbrians. He sent Chad to Canterbury to be consecrated Bishop of York. On Chad's arrival in Kent, however, he discovered Archbishop Dusdedit had died. As no successor had yet been appointed, Chad went to Bishop Wine in Wessex to be consecrated. Wine was the only consecrated Bishop in England at the time recognized by the Church at Rome.

Wine was later expelled by Cenwalh and went to King Wulfhere of Mercia. Bede stated that Wine purchased the see (diocese) of London from Wulfhere. Wine remained the Bishop of London until his death. 
Wine died in 671.
