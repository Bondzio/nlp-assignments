Techno

Techno is a form of electronic dance music that became popular in Detroit, Michigan during the mid-1980s. It was influenced by synthpop, house music, funk, post-disco and futuristic fiction ideas that were important during the end of the Cold War in the United States at that time. Juan Atkins is generally thought to be the founder of Techno music. Detroit Techno first became successful locally and then became popular around the world in the 1990s. 

The word "techno" comes from "technology". Fans of Techno music are careful in their use of the word. They are careful not to confuse it with other types of music that are similar but different (for example house, trance, hardcore). At the same time, the word "techno" is commonly used when talking about all forms of electronic music and dance music, especially in Europe, the Americas and Australia. Despite the common usage of the term to refer to all electronic dance in general, techno is a specific genre with its own, distinguishable sound. By nature, techno tends to be highly repetitive, instrumentally-oriented music which follows a regular four-on-the-floor beat. The genre places a strong emphasis on rhythm, and techno tends to have a very beat-based sound.
