Jodhpur (princely state)

Jodhpur state was a former princely state now in Rajasthan in India. The region was earlier called Marwar meaning 'the land of death' due to its severe famines and harsh conditions of living. Maharaja Umaid Singhji got Umaid Bhawan Palace built in Jodhpur at the time of famine so as to provide employment to public. 

Its ruler, the Maharaja of Jodhpur, expressed a wish to join Pakistan but Lord Mountbatten warned him that his subjects were mostly Hindus and his accession to Pakistan would create problems. As a result Jodhpur, too, acceded to India.
