George Shrinks

George Shrinks is a Canadianâ€“Chinese animated television series. It is based on the children's book by William Joyce. The show is about a ten-year-old boy named George. After a dream one night, he wakes up and is only three inches tall. He has adventures with his friends and family. He also drives mini machines that he made with his father.

The series started on 30 September 2000 on PBS Kids.

Because of George's very small size, everyday activities, such as working around the house or playing outside, often become exciting adventures. He mostly uses the Zooper Car to travel. It can change into a submarine or a helicopter.

The show has a retro-1940s look, with simple animation and colors. Most of the background music is jazz.
