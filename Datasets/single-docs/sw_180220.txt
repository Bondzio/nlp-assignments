Christian naturism

Naturist Christians are the Christians who practice naturism or nudism, and are a part of the clothes-free movement. They believe that the human body was the greatest making of God, and is neither shameful nor should be covered. Naturist Christians can be found in almost all of the different groups of Christianity (called "denominations"), and they do not find any conflict with the teachings of the Bible, and living their lives and worshiping God without any clothing. However, most have various differences with New Age and man-centered philosophy (called "humanism") which is common among other naturists and wish to be separated from it. This includes not worshiping nature at all.

In the Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve were living in the Garden of Eden as 'man and wife' . They ate the fruit not allowed by God, after being talked into it by the devil in the form of a snake. Then their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked. So, they gathered fig leaves to be used as simple clothing to cover their sexual organs. These became lacking very quickly, and Adam and Eve hid themselves from God in the trees.


Naturist Christians believe that it was the devil, not God, who told them that they were naked. Nor was it the desire of God that Adam and Eve wore clothing, even though they sinned (did wrong). Still, God did not take away the fig leaves of theirs. Just the opposite, they had free desire, and He made them clothing from the skins of animals, which required a killing an animal (called a "sacrifice"). After the execution of Jesus, the sacrifice of animals is no longer needed for the punishment of sin. For these reasons, Naturist Christians believe that we do not need to wear clothing (except in a cold or difficult climate), and the desire of the flesh (called "lust") can be avoided through God's power.
