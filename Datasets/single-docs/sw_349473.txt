BAFTA Award for Best Editing

The BAFTA Award for Best Editing is one of several awards of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). These awards have been given each year since 1968.




(There were six films nominated for this award in 2008, instead of the usual five, because of a tie in the voting.)
