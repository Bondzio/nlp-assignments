7 July 2005 London bombings

The 7 July 2005 London bombings were a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks. They were aimed at London's public transport system during the morning rush hour. They were carried out by British Muslim extremists.

At 08:50, three bombs exploded within fifty seconds of each other on three London Underground trains. A fourth exploded an hour later at 09:47 on a bus in Tavistock Square. The explosions were caused by home-made bombs. The bombs were packed into rucksacks and set off by the bombers themselves.

A memorial was made in Hyde Park, London on the 7 July 2009. This had 52 stainless steel pillars, one for each murder victim. They were arranged in four clusters for the four bomb sites.
52 died and over 700 were injured in the attack.

After this attack there was a huge police reform in the UK which is ongoing. The terror threat is at 'severe' and a large number of police in London are authorised to carry firearms. London is always on high alert for terrorism and proactively combats it with the help of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (similar to the American FBI) and MI6.
