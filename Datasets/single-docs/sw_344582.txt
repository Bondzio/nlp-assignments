Rose Hill, New South Wales

Rose Hill, New South Wales was the name of an Australian colonial settlement. 

Rose Hill was established on the Parramatta River on November 2, 1788. It was developed by Governor Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet. After Sydney Cove, this was the second settlement in Australia.
The fortified camp was named Rose Hill in honour of George Rose, who was a British politician and member of Parliament. Rose had helped influence the process which led to Phillip's appointment as leader of the colony.

The first crop of grain in Australia was grown at Rose Hill.

The area became part of the town of Parramatta.
