Quoll

Quoll (genus Dasyurus) are meat-eating marsupials native to Australia and Papua New Guinea. The name "dasyurus" means "hairy tail." Adults are between 25 and 75 cm long, with hairy tails about 20-35 cm long (about the size of a cat). Females have pouch to carry their babies.

Quolls are threatened by eating toxic cane toads, but a University of Sydney project is teaching them not to eat them.

The family Dasyurini to which quolls belong also includes the Tasmanian devil, antechinuses, the kowari, and mulgaras.

Within the genus "Dasyurus", the following species exist:

There is at least one fossil species from the Pliocene, that is "D. dunmalli".
