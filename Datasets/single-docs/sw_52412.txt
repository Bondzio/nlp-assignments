Incense

Incense is a fuel that is burned to make a smell. It can be used for many purposes, for example, during rituals in some religions. Incense can be used to make a place smell better or to help improve mood.

In Judaism, instructions for the use of incense were given in Exodus. (Eg Exodus 30:1). In Christianity, Christ is given myrrh and frankincense by the wise men. (Gospel of Matthew 2:11)

Incense is also used in Hindu rituals.
