In 2005, when Laxmi was 16 years old, a man threw acid in Laxmi's face because she did not want to marry him. The "Hindustan Times"newspaper wrote a story about Laxmi. She got 27,000 names on a petition. People signed the petition to show that they wanted a change in the sale of acid. She took the petition to the Indian Supreme Court. Because of the petition, the Indian Supreme Court told the central and state governments to control the sale of acid, and the Parliament to make it easier to hold a trial against a person who makes an acid attack. 

Laxmi Aggarwal is the director of Chhanv Foundation, an NGO (nongovernmental organization) that helps people who are able to keep living or succeeding in spite of acid attacks in India.
