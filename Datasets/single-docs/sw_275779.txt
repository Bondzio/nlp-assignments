Ernst Chain

Sir Ernst Boris Chain (19 June 1906 – 12 August 1979) was a German-born British biochemist. 

He shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, with Alexander Fleming and Howard Florey, for the discovery of penicillin and how it could cure bacterial infections. Later he worked on the chemical structure of penicillin and other natural antibiotics.

Chain was Jewish, and moved to England in 1933. In due course he took British citizenship, and was knighted in 1969. 

He won many awards: he was made a Commander of the Légion d'Honneur and awarded the Grande Ufficiale al Merito della Repubblica Italiana.
