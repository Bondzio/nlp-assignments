Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty

Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty is an action stealth video game created by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the 4th Metal Gear game produced and directed by Kojima and the second to Metal Gear Solid. Its release was followed by an extended edition, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows.
The main two characters in the game are Solid Snake (Iroquois Pliskin, who people assume he died in Shadow Moses). The other main character is Raiden, whose code-name was Snake and was changed because the leader of terrorists who call themselves Sons Of Liberty was Solidus Snake.
