Buddy Roemer presidential campaign, 2012

Former Governor of Louisiana and former U.S. Representative Buddy Roemer of Louisiana began a movement for the 2012 Republican Party nomination for President of the United States shortly following the 2010 midterm elections. 

After he was not added to the nationally-televised Republican debate, Roemer announced on February 22, 2012 that he would instead run on a third-party ticket, specifically the Reform Party and Americans Elect nominations. Shortly after Americans Elect announced they would not be fielding a candidate, Roemer's campaign announced on May 31, 2012 that he was ending his 2012 presidential campaign altogether.
