Lord Howe Island

Lord Howe Island is a small island about north east of Sydney. It is governed by New South Wales. About 70% of the island is part of the Lord Howe Island Group which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The island was first discovered in 1788 by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, who was captain of the HMS Supply. He was taking convicts from Sydney to start a new prison colony on Norfolk Island.
