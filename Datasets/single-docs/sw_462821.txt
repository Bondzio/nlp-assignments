Azerbaijani Chess Championship

The Azerbaijani Chess Championship is usually held in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is organised by the Azerbaijan Chess Federation (ACF). The first championship was played in 1934, when Azerbaijan was a part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. Championships were not held every year in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic until 1945. Since then they were held every year, which has continued today in independent Azerbaijan.
