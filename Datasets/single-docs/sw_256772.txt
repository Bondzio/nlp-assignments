Omniverse

The Omniverse is a set or number of supposedly co-existing universes.

One can imagine the stucture of an "omniverse" to be like that of a tree: the omniverse is the trunk, each multiverse is a branch, and each universe is a leaf.
A Ominiverse is closely related to the idea of Parallel Universe's. In term usage universes are refereed to as the Level 1 Multiverse
