United States presidential election, 1960

This election was between Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon. Kennedy won the election like many people suspected, but it was a much closer election than most people thought it would be. 

Incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower was not eligible to run again due to serving two terms provided by the amendment. 

This was the first presidential election in American history in which both candidates debated against each other on television. On television, Kennedy appeared calm while Nixon appeared nervous. More television viewers thought that Kennedy won the debate, while more radio listeners thought that Nixon won the debate.

This election was the last to not count District of Columbia as an electoral vote until the 1964 election.

Senator John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for President on January 2, 1960. Vice President Richard Nixon announced his candidacy on January 9, 1960.
