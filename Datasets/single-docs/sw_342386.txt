Armenian dram

The dram (Armenian: Դրամ) is the money of Armenia. It is divided into 100 luma. The word "dram" translates into English as "money". It is similar to the Greek drachma and the Arabic dirham. The Central Bank of Armenia is the only place that can print drams.

The first time the word dram was used for money in Armenia was from 1199 to 1375. The current dram began to be used 22 November 1993. This was after Armenia was no longer part of the Soviet Union.
