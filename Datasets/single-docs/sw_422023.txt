Ventriloquism

Ventriloquism is a form of stage theater in which a person changes his or her voice so that it sounds like the voice is coming from somewhere else (usually a puppet or a dummy). A ventriloquist is one who performs this art.

Originally, it was practiced in religion. Now, it is used in comedy.

Today's modern ventriloquism started in nightclubs.
