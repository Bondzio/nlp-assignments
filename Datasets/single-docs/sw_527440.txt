Hyundai Veracruz

Hyundai Veracruz is a mid-size CUV sold by Korean automaker Hyundai. It was introduced in South Korea on October 12, 2006. The Veracruz went on sale in March 2007 and is Hyundai's largest crossover (CUV). It replaced the mid-size SUV, the Hyundai Terracan. The Veracruz is built on a Hyundai Santa Fe platform. The revamped 2011 Veracruz was based on the same platform as the Kia Sorento.

The Veracruz offered third row seating and came with all-wheel drive. Hyundai discontinued the Veracruz internationally in 2013 and introduced a long wheelbase version of the Santa Fe.
