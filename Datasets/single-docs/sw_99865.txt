John A. Macdonald

Sir John Alexander Macdonald, GCB, KCMG, PC, PC (Can), (January 11, 1815 â€“ June 6, 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada and was a very important person in Canadian Confederation, which happened on July 1, 1867. Macdonald was in office from 1867 to 1873 and again from 1878 to 1891, making him the second longest-serving Prime Minister of Canada and the only one to win six majority governments.

One of the things Sir John A. Macdonald wanted to do was to build a transcontinental railway that would link Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. That railway, called the Canadian Pacific Railway, was completed in 1885.

Macdonald did not speak French as well the Prime Ministers that came after him, but he could speak Scottish Gaelic and a bit of Latin.
