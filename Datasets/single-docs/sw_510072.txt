2014–15 Eredivisie

The 2014–15 Eredivisie was the 59th Eredivisie tournament. PSV Eindhoven won the tournament, ending AFC Ajax's winning streak that was going since 2011.

Because Vitesse won the play-offs, they then qualified for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round.

Two teams from the 2014–15 Eredivisie and eight from the 2014–15 Eerste Divisie participated in these play-offs. In the end, De Graafschap and Roda JC Kerkrade won the play-offs, meaning that they move on to the 2015–16 Eredivisie, the two teams from the Eredivisie are relegated, and the six other teams remain in the Eerste Divisie.
