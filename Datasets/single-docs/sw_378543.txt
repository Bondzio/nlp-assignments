Internal conflict in Myanmar

The internal conflict in Myanmar (also known as "Burma") refers to fighting between government soldiers and rebels in Myanmar, which started shortly after the country separated from the United Kingdom in 1948. The government of Myanmar has fought different rebel groups from different ethnic minorities. The cause of the conflict is the government's refusal to give minority groups such as the communists and the Karen people the amount of political representation that they want. Since the beginning of the fighting, hundreds of thousands of civilians in Myanmar have been killed and millions have become refugees.
