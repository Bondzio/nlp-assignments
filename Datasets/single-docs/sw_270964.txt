Amadeus (movie)

Amadeus is a 1984 American biographical period drama movie directed by Milos Forman. It won eight Oscars. This is a biography of two great music composers - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Salieri knows Mozart is a great composer but tries to stop him out of envy.

The movie was shot on location in Prague, Kroměříž and Vienna. Notably, Forman was able to shoot scenes in the Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague, where "Don Giovanni" and "La Clemenza di Tito" were first shown two centuries before. Several other scenes were shot at the Barrandov Studios.
