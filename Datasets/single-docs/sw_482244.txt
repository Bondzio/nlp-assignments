Canadian French

Canadian French () includes the varieties of the French language spoken in Canada. In the 2011 census about 10 million people said they could speak French in a conversation. French is the mother tongue of about 7.3 million Canadians. 7.9 million said they spoke French at home. French is the official language of Quebec. But many government services are conducted in English. Manitoba and New Brunswick are the only provinces in Canada that are officially bilingual. There are differences between the French spoken in Paris (called metropolitan French) and Canadian French. When the first French immigrants came to Canada they spoke French as it was spoken in France at that time. Since then, Parisian (metropolitan) French has become the normal language in France. However both languages are very similar.
