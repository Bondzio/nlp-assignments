Femicide

The term femicide refers to killing women. Feminist Diana Russell is one of the many early pioneers of the term; she defines the word as referring to killing women because of their gender. The term was first used around 1801 in England to represent the killing of women. The term has created controversy, and other feminists differ on what the word "femicide" really means.
