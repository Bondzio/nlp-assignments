Morphology (biology)

Morphology is the study of animal or human form or body shape. It is the branch of biology dealing with the study of the form of organisms and their specific structural features. 

The concept of morphology was developed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1790) and independently by the German anatomist and physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach (1800).

In general use, the word morphology refers to the form and structure of an organism as a whole, including all internal and external structures. This includes aspects of the outward appearance (shape, structure, colour, pattern) as well as the form and structure of the internal parts like bones and organs. Morphology is contrasted to physiology, which deals primarily with function.


In English-speaking countries, the term "molecular morphology" has been used for some time for describing the structure of compound molecules, such as polymers
