Giuseppe Farina

Emilio Giuseppe "Nino" Farina (30 October 1906 - 30 June 1966) was an Italian racing driver. He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.

He was born in Turin. He died when he accidentally crashed his car in Aiguebelle, France.
