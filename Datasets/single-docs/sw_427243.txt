Underground cable

An underground cable is a cable that is buried below the ground. They distribute electrical power or telecommunications. Such cables are an alternative to overhead cables, which are several metres above the ground. Overhead cables are often replaced with underground cables. This is mainly for aesthetic purposes, because underground cables can not be seen. They are also less dangerous to people because they are out of the way. They cost more to install, but last longer.
