Yume Nikki

The game is known for its strange and sometimes scary content.

The player controls Madotsuki and can move her using the arrow keys. If you make her go to sleep by interacting with the bed, she goes into a dream version of her room. From there, you can make her explore 12 different dream worlds by going through doors that are in a large, dark place north of her room.

To beat the game, the player has to find all 24 "effects" that are hidden in Madotsuki's dreams.
