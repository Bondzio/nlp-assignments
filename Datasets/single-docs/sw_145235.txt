Book of Baruch

The Book of Baruch, sometimes called 1 Baruch, is a deuterocanonical or apocryphal book of the Bible. Even though it is not in the Hebrew Bible, it is in the Septuagint and in the Vulgate Bible, and also in Theodotion's version of the Bible. The Book of Baruch has different prophecies. It is considered sacred by Catholics and members of the Orthodox Church but not by Protestants. Catholic Bibles also add the Letter of Jeremiah to the Book of Baruch as a sixth chapter.
