Steel Dragon 2000

The Steel Dragon 2000 is a steel roller coaster at Nagashima Spa Land amusement park in Mie Prefecture, Japan. It is the longest roller coaster in the world.

Steel Dragon 2000 is the tallest coaster to use a traditional chain lift. Because of the length of the lift hill, two chains are usedâ€”one for the bottom half and one for the top half. A single chain would have been too long, heavy and very slow, at least twice the weight of a single train. Special brakes allow two trains to be on the lift at the same time.

The building of Steel Dragon 2000 required much more steel than other coasters for earthquake protection. This put the cost of the coaster at over $50 million.
