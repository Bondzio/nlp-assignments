Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2017

The 2017 Bulgarian parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria on 26 March 2017. They were originally scheduled for 2018, but the previous political parties could not form a government. So early elections were called.

Before the elections, Boyko Borisov resigned from his prime minister position after the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016. 

In order for a political party to win seats, they must receive at least 4% of the popular vote.

The pro-European Union party, GERB, won the most seats. The Bulgarian Socialist Party gained the most seats, while the Reformist Bloc lost all of their 23 seats.

Below is the weekly average of opinion polls in 2017 towards the election. The dots at the end of the graph show the final results.

After the results, Boyko Borisov is expected to become prime minister again.
