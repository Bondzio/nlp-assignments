Ustad Allah Bux

Ustad Allah Baksh (1895-1978) (Urdu:استاد الله بخش) was a very well known early modern artist and painter of Pakistan. He is best known today for his depictions of rural life in the country and for subjects from Hindu and Persian mythology.Whenever Pakistan's folk culture and life will be talked about, the name of Ustad (ustad means a maestro) Allah Baksh will stand out prominently. He was the man who immortalized our rural life, and specially of the Punjab – the land where he was born in 1885 in the small town of Wazirabad, Punjab. His very near-to-life life-size paintings are full of colour, life and people that forces an onlooker to stop in his tracks and appreciate his masterly work of art.
