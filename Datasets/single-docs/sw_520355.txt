Jesus piece

A Jesus piece is a spiritual or religious piece of jewelry which shows the face of Jesus. 

Jesus pieces are popular in the Hip-Hop community. Many Hip-Hop artists and celebrities like The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, and Kanye West often wear Jesus pieces, and have them decorated with rare or expensive gems (jewels). 

Less expensive Jesus pieces are also sold. They are made of things like wood or inexpensive metals.

The first Jesus piece was worn by Christopher Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G.). It was made by Tito Caicedo, Wallace's jeweler (jewelry-maker). Wallace had Caicedo make many more Jesus pieces, paying him about $10,000 for each. Wallace wore some of these Jesus pieces himself, and give others to people he worked with. The Jesus pieces were decorated with expensive gems, especially on Jesus's hair.
