Patrick Henry

Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736 â€“ June 6, 1799) served as the first post-colonial Governor of Virginia from 1776 to 1779. He is known for his "Give me Liberty, or give me death" speech in 1775 during the American Revolutionary War in St. John's Church. He was a fiery speaker who evoked great emotion from listeners. He unsuccessfully opposed the United States Constitution, which made him an enemy of John Adams and the Federalist Party. After the French Revolution, however, he supported Adams. 

His wife, Sarah Shelton, had a mental illness and died in 1775. He married his second wife, Dorthea Dandrige, two years later in 1777.
