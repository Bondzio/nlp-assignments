Mississippian culture

Mississippian culture is the culture of the Mississippian people. They were Native Americans who lived in the Mississippi River Valley. Around 900â€“1450 AD, the Mississippian culture developed and spread through the Eastern United States. Mississippian people were most often farmers who settled into river valleys and grew the "three sisters" of corn, beans and squash.

The Mississippian peoples lived throughout the Southeast and Midwest, an area from the Florida panhandle westward into Oklahoma, northward to Minnesota and eastward to Ohio.
