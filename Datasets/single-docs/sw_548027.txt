MGM Studios Home Entertainemnt

MGM Studios Home Entertainment is a home video company was created in 2008 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and restructured MGM Home Entertainment as it's in-name-only subsidiary. It's MGM and UA movies, and TV shows are available on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2011 (a year that MGM emerged from bankruptcy), MGM Studios Home Entertainment is reincarnated as a joint venture partnership between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Amblin Partners, StudioCanal and BBC. Now through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, MGM handles home entertainment distribution rights to theatrical films and television shows, following the latter's emergence from bankruptcy and financial troubles.

In 2016, MGM Studios Home Entertainment formed an alliance with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment to release films that are produced by Amblin Partners under the Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Pictures brands, with MGM handles distribution of the film and television library and Universal handles distribution rights to the Amblin films, since Universal Studios bought the minority stake in Amblin Partners, strengthening the relationship between Universal and Amblin, and reuniting a minority percentage of the DreamWorks Pictures label with DreamWorks Animation.
