Masjid al-Haram

Al-Masjid al-Ḥarām ( "The Sacred Mosque"), is the largest mosque in the world. It is in the city of Mecca. It surrounds the Kaaba (the place which Muslims face while offering daily prayers). It is considered the holiest place on Earth by Muslims. The mosque is also known as the Grand Mosque. This mosque has nine minarets. Like Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina, it also has undergone many renovations and expansions. The latest expansion was during King Fahd's reign. Further expansion was planned by the former ruler, King Abdullah.
