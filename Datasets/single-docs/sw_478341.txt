Landslide victory

A landslide victory is when one candidate or political party in an election receives a lot more votes or seats than their opponent.

An example of a landslide victory is when Ronald Reagan won the 1984 United States presidential election by winning 49 out of the 50 states. Another example is when Tony Blair and his Labour Party won the United Kingdom general elections of 1997 and 2001.

A landslide victory can happen when people vote for the person they think is going to win. These voters vote for the candidate no matter what their politics are.
