The Russian Academy of Sciences (, shortened to , "RAN") consists of the national academy of Russia and a network of scientific research institutes from across the country. It also includes other scientific and social groups like libraries, publishing units and hospitals.

There are two types of membership in the academy. The top-level members are academicians (913 scientists, as of August 2017). The next-level members are corresponding members (1136 scientists). There are also professors of the RAN (493 scientists). 104 professors became corresponding members and are now counted twice: as professors and as members. The last elections were organized in October 2016. To be elected to the Academy is a great honor for any researcher.
