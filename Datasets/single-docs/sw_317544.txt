Samoa at the Olympics

Samoa was first at the Olympic Games in 1984. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then. The nation has never been in the Winter Olympic Games.

As of 2011, no athlete competing for Samoa has ever won an Olympic medal.

The National Olympic Committee for Samoa was formed in 1983 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year.
