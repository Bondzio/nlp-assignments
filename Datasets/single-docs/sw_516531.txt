Kidron Valley necropolis

Kidron Valley necropolis (also called Silwan necropolis) is a row of ancient Jewish burial caves located in the Kidron Valley. The valley lies between the City of David and the north-west slope of the Mount of Olives. The ancient caves face towards the City of David to the west under the houses of the Arab neighborhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. The row of ancient burial sites ends at the Tomb of Pharaoh's daughter monument. It is not burial cave, but also the continuing of the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery from south beside the Arab neighborhoods.
