Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna

Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (Sometimes called Anastasia: The Story of Anna) is a 1986 Golden Globe and Emmy Award-winning TV movie, starring Amy Irving and Olivia de Havilland. The movie was loosely based on the story of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and the novel "The Riddle of Anna Anderson" by Peter Kurth. It was Christian Bale's first movie and was originally broadcast in two parts.

The movie is about Anna Anderson, who believes that she is Anastasia, daughter of Nicholas II of Russia. Anna first tells her story in the 1920s when she is at a Berlin asylum. Her story of escape from the Bolsheviks who killed the rest of her family in 1918 seems so vivid that many Russians believe her. She slowly gains more trust, but the Romanov family does not believe her. The movie never reveals if Anna really is Anastasia.
