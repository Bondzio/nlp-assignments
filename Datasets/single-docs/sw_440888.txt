Forgotten Coast

Florida's Forgotten Coast is a registered trademark. The Apalachicola Bay Chamber of Commerce registered it in the early 1990s. The name refers to a mostly quiet, undeveloped (few buildings) part of coastline from Mexico Beach on the Gulf of Mexico to St. Marks on Apalachee Bay in the U.S. state of Florida. The nearest large city is Tallahassee. It is about 90 miles (145 km) northeast of Apalachicola. Panama City, home of Tyndall Air Force Base, is about 60 miles (95 km) to the northwest.
