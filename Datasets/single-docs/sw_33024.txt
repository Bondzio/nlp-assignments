Coral fungi

Coral fungior claviroid fungi, are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral, but can also be shaped like forks, worms or clubs.
They are rubbery and sometimes are brightly coloured.

Originally, such fungi were put in the genus "Clavaria", and called "clavarioid", which means "Clavaria"-like. It is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, we keep the informal (non-taxonomic) name of "clavarioid fungi", and it is frequently used in research papers.

Most coral fungi grow on the ground, but some grow on logs and stumps.
They are usually found in forests but some can also be found in fields.

Although they are not poisonous, some kinds are a laxative and some can cause stomach upset.
