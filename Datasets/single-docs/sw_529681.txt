Bard's Oath

The Bard's Oath is the third book in the Dragonlords series written by Joanne Bertin. It starts as two stories that merge in the middle of the book. One story is about Raven Redhawkson and why he is at the Balyaranna Fair (a horse festival). The other story is about Bard Leet and his plot for revenge over the death of a family member.
