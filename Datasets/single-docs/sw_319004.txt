Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas

Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas is a television Christmas special that was first shown on the American television network ABC on Thursday, November 24, 2011. It is based on characters from the movie "Ice Age". The entire cast from the movies all play the same characters; Ciara Bravo is the voice of Peaches, who is now a young kid. There are new characters voiced by Billy Gardell, T. J. Miller, and Judah Friedlander.

In the middle of decorating for the holiday season, Sid (John Leguizamo) accidentally destroys Manny's (Ray Romano) favorite decoration, the traditional Christmas rock (predating the Christmas tree). Sid, convinced by Manny that he's now on Santa's naughty list, takes off with Crash (Seann William Scott), Eddie (Josh Peck), and Peaches (Ciara Bravo) — who's still a young child — for the North Pole to get him off the naughty list. On their journey, they befriend one of Santa's reindeer Prancer (T. J. Miller).

When they arrive at the North Pole, Sid and his crew accidentally destroy Santa's (Billy Gardell) workshop. When Manny, Ellie, and Diego (worried over Peaches' safety) arrive at the North Pole, they reunite to save Christmas. With the help of an army of mini-sloths (who had attacked Sid and his crew before), the Sub-Zero Heroes make enough new toys for every child on Earth. Santa is then able to distribute presents on a worldwide basis after Prancer and his whole family volunteer to pull his sleigh. Santa has also left Scrat (Chris Wedge) a present: A small acorn, which he then loses again.
