Beit HaNassi

Beit HaNassi ("President's House" in Hebrew), also known as Mishkan HaNassi ( "Presidential Residence") is the main residence of the President of Israel. It is in Jerusalem. The building was opened in 1971, after the Israeli government approved a state home for the president. In 2011, renovations were started after defects were found in the building.
