Rich Peverley

Rich Peverley (born July 8, 1982 in Guelph, Ontario) is a Canadian ice hockey center. He currently plays for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL).

Peverley played hockey in the ECHL for 2 seasons with the South Carolina Stingrays and Reading Royals. He has formerly played for the Nashville Predators for 3 seasons, the Atlanta Thrashers for 3 seasons and the Boston Bruins for 3 seasons. He won the Stanley Cup with the Bruins on June 15, 2011 when the Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks in game 7 by a score of 4-0.

On March 10, 2014, during a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, he collapsed on the team bench. He has had heart conditions in the past and missed a few games the week earlier when he didn't feel well after a game. He is in stable condition. The NHL released a state on Peverley's health saying: "Dallas player Rich Peverley is doing well and is in stable condition. He was transported to the hospital. As a result of the emotional state of the players on both teams caused by the medical emergency, the game will be played at a later date."
