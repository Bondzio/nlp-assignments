Himni i Flamurit

Himni i Flamurit (in English: "Hymn to the Flag") is the national anthem of Albania. The words were written by the Albanian poet Asdreni ("Aleksandër Stavre Drenova"). The hymn was first published as a poem in "Liri e Shqipërisë" (in English: "Freedom of Albania"), an Albanian newspaper in Sofia, Bulgaria, on April 21, 1912. It was later printed in a volume of poems by Drenova titled "Ëndra e lotë" (in English: "Dreams and tears"), which was published in Bucharest.

The music of the anthem was composed by the Romanian composer Ciprian Porumbescu.

There are two versions of the anthem: a long and a short one. Below is the text for the long version. The second stanza is repeated at the end.
