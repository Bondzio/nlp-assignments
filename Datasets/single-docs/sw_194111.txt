Trix (cereal)

Trix is a brand of breakfast cereal. It is made by General Mills for North America and Cereal Partners in other parts of the world. They are vanilla-flavored puffed cereal pieces. They were first round, brightly colored cereal pieces. In 1991, they were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces. In 2006, they were changed back to their round shape in the United States and some other places. In the present, the slogan says: "Trix is not for rabbits!".

When the cereal was first made in 1955, it originally had three flavors: "Orangey Orange", "Raspberry Red", and "Lemony Yellow". Between 1984 and 1999, four more flavors were added: "Grapity Purple" (1984), "Lime Green" (1991), "Wildberry Blue" (1998-2006), and "Watermelon" (1999). Yoplait brand yogurt, made by General Mills, makes Trix Yogurt. It has flavors such as "Watermelon Burst". A different type of Trix cereal called "Trix Swirls" is made also. It is made of puffed pieces with different colored swirls.
