Emperor Yōmei

The years of the reign of Yōmei start in 585 and end in 587. The names and sequence of the early emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Yōmei to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Yōmei"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations. 

Emperor Yōmei was the fourth son of Emperor Kimmei. His mother, Soga no Kitashihime, was a daughter of Soga no Iname. 

His palace in Yamato Province was called Namitsuki no Miya at Ikebe. 

Yōmei had three Empresses and seven Imperial sons and daughters.

Yōmei's son, Prince Umayado, is also known as Prince Shōtoku.




According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Yōmei is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
