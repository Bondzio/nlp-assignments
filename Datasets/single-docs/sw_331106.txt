Concorde

Concorde was a passenger airplane that flew faster than the speed of sound. It was made by the French company AÃ©rospatiale and the British company British Aircraft Corporation. Concorde carried passengers from 1976 to 2003.

Concorde flew across the Atlantic Ocean in a little less than 3.5 hours. Other airplanes take about eight hours.

The first scheduled flights were on 21 January 1976. Concorde flew between several different cities in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Some people did not like the sonic booms caused by Concorde flying faster than the speed of sound. At different times, Concorde was not allowed to fly over certain countries because of this.
