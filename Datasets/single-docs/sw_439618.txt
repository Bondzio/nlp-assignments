Joaquín Guzmán

Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera (born December 25, 1954, or April 4, 1957) is a Mexican drug lord who headed the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal organization named after the Mexican Pacific coast state of Sinaloa where it was initially formed.

Loera is known as "El Chapo Guzmán" ("Shorty Guzmán") for his height. He became Mexico's top drug kingpin in 2003 after the arrest of his rival Osiel Cárdenas of the Gulf Cartel. He was thought to be one of the "most powerful drug traffickers in the world" by the United States Department of the Treasury.

Guzmán was once again arrested by Mexican authorities in Mexico on February 22, 2014. He was found in a beach resort in Mazatlan, but details of the arrest have not been revealed. On January 8, 2016, Guzmán was captured at the coastal city of Los Mochis, in northern Sinaloa, following a gun battle by the Mexican Navy.
