Rubin attended Vassar College where she earned her B.A.  in 1948. She earned her M.A. at Cornell in 1951. She received her Ph.D. in astronomy at Georgetown University. At Cornell her thesis studied evidence of bulk rotation in the universe. Rubin taught at Georgetown before becoming a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Science. Rubin spent a year as a teacher in math and physics at Montgomery County Junior College. She contributed to a number of newspaper. She is an associated editor of the Astronomical Journal and the editorial board of Science Magazine. Rubin was on the astronomical committee at Harvard University and at the National Academy of Sciences. Rubin was an American astronomer who discovered dark matter. Dark matter[1] is a material in the universe that does not reflect light. She and W. Kent Ford found that the stars closeted to the center of the galaxy and the stars farthest from the center of the galaxy moved at the same rate.  Their findings said that mass astronomers could see only 10 percent of the galaxy's total mass. This makes dark matter invisible. Rubin joined the council of American Women in Science in 1984 to promote women in astronomy. 

Rubin was given honorary degrees from Creighton University, Harvard University, and Yale University. Rubin won the National Medal of Sciences in 1993.

Rubin is married to Robert Rubin who is a physicist. She wrote a children's book on astronomy to encourage young girls to study science. Rubin had four children named David, Allan, Judith, and Carl. Her four kids all became scientists.[2]   Rubin passed away in Princeton on December 25, 2016.
