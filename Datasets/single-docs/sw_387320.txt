Human chorionic gonadotropin

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy. Some tumors might produce this hormone. From December 6, 2011, the [FDA] (Food and Drug Administration) made illegal selling hCG diet products in pharmacies.

Controversy about injected hCG for weight loss started marketing campaign for injections of "homeopathic hCG" for weight control. The ingredients in these products if prepared from true hCG via homeopathic dilution, will contain either no hCG at all or only small amount of it.

We can measure hCG level with Blood or urine tests. These can be done by pregnancy tests.

Below is a list of hCG levels during pregnancy. ("LMP" is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of your last period.) The level of hCG grows over the time during pregnancy.
