Medical school

A medical school is a place where medical students learn medicine. When they graduate from a medical school, they become a physician or a doctor. Medical Schools grant Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) and sometimes Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degrees. Students take classes in human biology and disease then take a license exam to practice medicine.

A medical student or student doctor is a person who has been accepted to a medical school and is studying to become a doctor. Medical students are typically required to learn about basic health, science, technology and the clinical practice of medicine. During basic technology study, most medical students learn about human anatomy, physiology, diseases, and different drugs.

Medical students are generally considered to be at the earliest stage of the medical career pathway. In some locations they are required to be registered with a government body.

Medical students typically engage in both basic science and practical clinical coursework during their tenure in medical school. Course structure and length vary greatly among countries.
