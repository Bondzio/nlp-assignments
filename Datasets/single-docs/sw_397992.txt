Chur

Chur or Coire is the capital city of the caton of Graub√ºnden (also called "Grisons"). About 34.000 people live in the city, which is probably the oldest in Switzerland. The city is located on the Rhine. 

The name "chur" derives perhaps from the Celtic "kora" or "koria", meaning "tribe", or from the Latin "curia" 

Archaeological evidence of settlement at the site goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900-3500 BC), Various artefacts from the Bronze Age and Iron Age have been found in the city. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur was created in the 4th century. It pis probably the first Roman Catholic diocese to be created northn of the Alps.
