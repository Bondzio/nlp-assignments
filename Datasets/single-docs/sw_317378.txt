Hurricane Juan (1985)

Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the most costly of all the storms of the hurricane season. It killed about 24 people and caused about $1.5 billion in damage even though it was a weak hurricane. Even though the damage was bad, the name Juan was not removed from the list of hurricane names in the spring of 1986.
