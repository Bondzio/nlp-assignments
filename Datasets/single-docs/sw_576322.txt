Chained to the Rhythm

"Chained to the Rhythm" is a 2017 disco and dancehall song by American singer-songwriter Katy Perry. Skip Marley, the grandson of Jamaican singer Bob Marley, raps in the song. It is taken from Perry's fifth studio album, "Witness", and is the ninth track on the album. It is about partying and being aware of things in society.

The song hit #1 in Mexico and Hungary. It also hit the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. In the United States, the song hit #4 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.

For her fifth studio album, Perry said she wanted to make purposeful pop music. She had gotten depressed when Donald Trump was elected President of the United States in November 2016 and was not in the mood to "write a club banger."

The video for the song is set in a carnival-type land called Oblivia and shows Perry riding amusement park rides. It was released on February 21, 2017.
