One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (movie)

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 American drama movie. It is set on a locked psychiatric ward in 1963 in Oregon. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ken Kesey. Milos Forman directed the movie, and Jack Nicholson plays the lead role.

It was the first movie to win all five main Academy Awards since "It Happened One Night" in 1934. These awards included Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay.

This movie was the 20th best ever, according to the American Film Industry's AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.

The novel's writer, Kesey, did not like the movie. This was because it did not take the perspective (view) of a Native American character, Chief Bromden (a more important character in the book than in the movie). The screenplay was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.
