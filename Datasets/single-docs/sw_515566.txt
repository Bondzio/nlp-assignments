Fired Up (Alesha Dixon album)

Fired Up is the debut studio album by British recording artist Alesha Dixon. The album was recorded after Dixon's group Mis-Teeq had split up. Dixon signed a deal with Polydor Records. Her single "Lipstick" reached number 14 on the UK chart. Her next single with Polydor, "Knockdown" failed to reach the Top 40 (it reached number 45). Dixon left Polydor afterwards but kept the rights to her songs from the album. "Fired Up" was finally released as a CD in Japan in 2008. The album was billed as just Alesha instead of using Dixon's full name.

For the album, Dixon worked with many known UK songwriters including Richard X and Xenomania.
