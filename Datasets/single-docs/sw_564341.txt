The guanacaste is a large tree, growing to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is light gray. The crown (the upper part of tree) is broad and widely spreading. Leaves are long, alternate and compound.

The guanacaste is evergreen, or briefly deciduous for 1â€“2 months during the dry season (without rains). Most leaves fall in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, leaves start to appear and produce a fresh, thick crown by April.

Flowers are hermaphrodite; the pollination is by insects like bees.

The fruit is a legume (also known as a pod) with the shape of a human ear.

The guanacaste tree is native to tropical America. It grows from southern Mexico through Central America to northern South America. It is found also in the West Indies. It has been introduced in other tropical regions.

It grows normally at an elevation from sea level to , usually along the coast and rivers.

The wood is reddish-brown, lightweight and water-resistant; it is used to make objects like doors, windows, furniture, cabinets, and for shipbuilding. It is used also as firewood.
