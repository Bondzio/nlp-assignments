Graham Webb

Graham Paul Webb (13 January 1944 â€“ 28 May 2017) was an English racing cyclist. He became the world amateur road race champion in 1967. In response to a journalist's shouted comment that the last British amateur world road champion had been Dave Marsh 45 years earlier, Webb retorted: "And they'll have to wait another 45 years before another British rider wins." 

Webb died on 28 May 2017 in London at the age of 73.
