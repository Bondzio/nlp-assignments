Worm charming

Worm charming, worm grunting, and worm fiddling are methods of attracting earthworms out from the ground. It is usually done to collect bait for fishing, but it can also be a sport. Most worm charming methods involve vibrating the soil, which encourages the worms to the surface. One method involves twirling a steel pole in the ground, which moves the dirt, making the worms in the area go to the top of the ground.
The worm grunting capital of the world is Albuquerque, New Mexico. Every year on June 21, thousands of fishermen show up for the annual worm grunting festival.
The activity is usually performed to collect bait for fishing.
