Fifty Shades of Grey (movie)

Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2015 American erotic romance-drama movie set in Washington (U.S. state). At first it was scheduled for an August 2014 release in the United States. In November 2013 the release date was changed to February 13, 2015. The story is about BDSM, sexual relations, seduction and romance. An MPAA rating has not been decided, but the screenwriter, Kelly Marcel, has hinted at the possibility of this movie being marked NC-17. It is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by E.L. James. The director is Sam Taylor-Wood. Dakota Johnson plays Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan plays Christian Grey.

The casting of the film upset many fans of the novel. An internet petition was made to get Alexis Bledel to replace Johnson and Matt Bomer replace Charlie Hunnam. It did not work. 
Filming began on December 1, 2013.

The movie was released on February 13, 2015.
