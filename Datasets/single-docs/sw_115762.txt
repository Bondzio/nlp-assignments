Males appear more colorful and tend to have larger fins than the females. Males come in all sorts of color patterns and fin types. Female Bettas have a more pointy shape at their stomachs. A popular fin type is the veiltail, which has long droopy fins resembling a dress. Red and Blue are the most common colors in betta fish. White, Black, and Green bettas are considered rare by some.
