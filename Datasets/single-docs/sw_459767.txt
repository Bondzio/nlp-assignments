UEFA Euro 2016

The 2016 UEFA European Championship (also called the UEFA Euro 2016) was the 15th UEFA European Football Championship tournament and it was held in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016. The tournament was the first to have 24 teams, instead of the previous 16.

Portugal won the tournament over the hosts, France. They will also qualify for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, which will take place in Russia.

Four bids came before the deadline on 9 March 2009. France, Italy and Turkey put in single bids while Norway and Sweden put in a joint bid. Norway and Sweden eventually withdrew their bid in December 2009.

The host was selected on 28 May 2010.

Ten venues will be used for the tournament. These venues were confirmed by UEFA on 25 January 2013.

Each team has a "team base camp" for its stay between the matches. The teams will train here as well. The list of team base camps was released on 31 January 2016.

A win would earn the team 3 points, a draw would earn them 1 point, and a loss earns them no points. The schedule of the tournament was announced on 25 April 2014
