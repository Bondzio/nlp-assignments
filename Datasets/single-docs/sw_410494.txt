Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love

Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love is a 1996 erotic romance movie. While this movie was being shot in India, the name of the movie was kept secret because the Indian government would not have allowed filming with the name "Kama Sutra". It was instead named "Maya & Tara". When the movie was finished, it was banned in India due to the erotic scenes, especially homosexual scenes.

In the United States, this movie was originally rated NC-17. It was later trimmed and re-rated R.
