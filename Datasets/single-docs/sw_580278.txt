Douglas H. Ginsburg

Douglas Howard Ginsburg (born May 25, 1946) is a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He was appointed to this court at age forty in October 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, and served as its chief judge from July 2001 until February 2008. 

Ginsburg was nominated by Reagan to fill a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy left by Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in October 1987, but soon withdrew from consideration after his earlier marijuana use created a controversy.
