Lieutenant Governor of Iowa

The Lieutenant Governor of Iowa is a assistant governor. If the governor quits or dies, then the lieutenant governor will become governor of the state. The office of Lieutenant Governor is being temporarily held by Adam Gregg because the Lieutenant Governor before, Kim Reynolds, became Governor of Iowa on May 24, 2017 following Terry Branstad's resignation to become an U.S. ambassador.

Before 1990, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected in separate elections; since then they have run together on the same ticket.

, there are eight former U.S. lieutenant governors of Iowa who are currently living at this time, the oldest U.S. lieutenant governor of Iowa being Roger Jepsen (served 1969–1973, born 1928). The most recent death of a former U.S. lieutenant governor of Iowa was that of Joy Corning (served 1991–1999, born 1932), on May 20, 2017.
