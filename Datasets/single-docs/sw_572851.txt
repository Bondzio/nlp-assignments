Norma McCorvey

Norma Leah McCorvey (née Nelson; September 22, 1947 – February 18, 2017), better known by the legal pseudonym "Jane Roe", was an American activist. She was the plaintiff in the landmark American lawsuit "Roe v. Wade" in 1973. 

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual state laws banning abortion are unconstitutional. Later, McCorvey's views on abortion changed greatly because she became a Roman Catholic activist in the pro-life movement.
