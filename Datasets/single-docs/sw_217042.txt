Metro Cammell

The Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company (MCCW) (often called Metro Cammell) was a manufacturer of railway carriages and wagons. They were based in Saltley - and later Washwood Heath - in Birmingham, England. They are best known for making most of the trains on the London Underground and some first generation diesel multiple units, until they were sold to French company Alstom in 1989.
