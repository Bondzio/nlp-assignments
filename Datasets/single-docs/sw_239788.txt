Ixnay on the Hombre

Ixnay on the Hombre is the fourth album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 1997. This was their first album released on the major label Columbia Records (however, in Europe, it was released on Epitaph) and also its first collaboration with record producer Dave Jerden, who would produce the band's next album "Americana" (1998). Even though the album did not maintain the same popularity as "Smash", "Ixnay on the Hombre" was well received by both critics and fans, selling more than 5.5 million copies worldwide, and being certified platinum by the RIAA.
