The McGuire Sisters

The McGuire Sisters were a group of three American girls originally from Ohio: Christine, Dorothy and Phyllis McGuire. This trio began around 1952 and went on until 1968, during which time the group had many popular hit songs, "Sincerely" and "Sugartime", the earlier of which was in 1954 and the latter during 1958. The group were sometimes compared to the Andrews Sisters due to their sometimes similar singing style and behavior.
