Division of Kooyong

The Division of Kooyong is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It was one of the divisions for the first Federal election in 1901. It includes the suburbs of Kew, Hawthorn, Hawthorn East, Balwyn, Canterbury, Camberwell and Surrey Hills. It is named after the suburb of Kooyong. "Kooyong" is an Indigenous Australian word meaning "resting place". Because of boundary changes over the years, the suburb of Kooyong is no longer in the Division and is now in the Division of Higgins.

Kooyong has been held by non-Labor parties since 1901. Famous members include the Opposition Leader and later Chief Justice John Latham, Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies and Opposition Leader Andrew Peacock.
