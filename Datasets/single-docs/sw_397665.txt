Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ

Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is an historical novel by Lew Wallace. It was published on November 12, 1880 by Harper & Brothers. The novel was the first work of fiction to receive a blessing from a pope. This happened during the reign of Pope Leo XIII. 

The novel is set in Ancient Rome and Ancient Judea. It tells the story of two men - one a Jewish prince (Ben-Hur) and the other a Roman tribune - whose lifelong friendship turns to bitter hatred. At the end, Ben-Hur witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. He becomes a Christian. 

The book was the best-selling American novel from the time of its publication until "Gone with the Wind" appeared in 1936. Following the 1959 release of the movie "Ben-Hur" starring Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, sales of the novel soared, topping those of "Gone with the Wind".
