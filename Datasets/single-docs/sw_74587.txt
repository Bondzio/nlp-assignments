Intolerable Acts

The Intolerable Acts are laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774.

The British Parliament passed these laws to punish the Massachusetts colony for the Boston Tea Party.

Other colonies offered Massachusetts their support. They sent supplies to Boston. The Committees of Correspondence also called for a meeting of all colonies. This meeting would decide what to do about their problems with Britain, which led to the Continental Congress.
