Erasmusbridge

The Erasmusbridge is a bridge in the city of Rotterdam. The bridge was the second bridge built over the Maas river. The bridge is named after Desiderius Erasmus who was born in Rotterdam. The bridge connects the northern and southern parts of Rotterdam. The bridge is designed by Ben van Berkel. Queen Beatrix opened the bridge in 1996. The bridge is a long Cable-stayed bridge, and is high. Between the pillar and the district "Kop Van Zuid" is a long bascule Bridge (it lifts to allow ships to pass under it).
