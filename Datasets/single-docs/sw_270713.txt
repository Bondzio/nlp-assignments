Wandering albatross

The wandering albatross is a large seabird of the family Diomedeidae. It is also called the snowy albatross or white-winged albatross. It is the largest member of the genus "Diomedea" (the great albatrosses) and has the largest wingspan of any living bird. It can have a wing-span of up to 11.5 feet (3.50 m). The IUCN says it is a vulnerable species.

Wandering slbatross live together when breeding, which they do once every two years. They are monogamous, and usually mate for life. They can live for over 50 years, and adult mortality is only 5 to 7% a year (this is very low for birds). 

They make many kinds of noises, such as screams, whistles, grunts and bill clapping. When they are looking for a mate, they spread their wings, wave their heads and tap their bills together. They feed at night on cephalopods, small fish, and crustaceans
