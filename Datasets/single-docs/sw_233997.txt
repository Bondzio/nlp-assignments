Sukoró

Sukoró is a holiday resort in Hungary situated at the northern coast of Lake Velencei and at the south foot of Velencei Hills. The victory at Pákozd-Sukoró in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 established the reputation of the village. The war council before the battle was held in the protected Calvinist Church of Sukoró, where memories are still preserved.
