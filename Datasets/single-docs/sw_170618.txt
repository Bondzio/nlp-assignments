Tim Horton

Miles Gilbert "Tim" Horton (January 12, 1930 – February 21, 1974) was a Canadian professional hockey defenceman from Cochrane, Ontario. He played 22 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the New York Rangers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, and Buffalo Sabres. He was also a businessman and the co-founder of Tim Hortons, now Canada's largest restaurant chain. He died in an car crash at St. Catharines, Ontario in 1974 at the age of 44.

In 1964, Horton opened his first Tim Hortons shop in Hamilton, Ontario. 

As well as over 2700 shops in Canada, Buffalo, New York has over 80 Tim Hortons Doughnut Shops, and they can be found in Detroit, Michigan; Columbus, Ohio; and other American cities, mainly in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region. There are now over 400 shops in the United States.

Early on the morning of February 21, 1974, Horton was driving on the Queen Elizabeth Way from Toronto to his home in Buffalo after the Buffalo Sabres had played in Toronto the night before, in his sports car. He lost control and hit a concrete culvert. The crash turned the vehicle over and Horton, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown out of the car. Horton was dead on arrival at the local hospital. A police officer following Horton said that he had been going over 160 km/h (100 mph).

Tim Horton is buried in York Cemetery Toronto..
