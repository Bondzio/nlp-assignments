Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad

Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad (born June 28, 1973) is a Norwegian drummer. He currently plays for the black metal bands Satyricon and 1349. 

He has also been the drummer for Gorgoroth, Zyklon-B, Gehenna and Keep of Kalessin. He first joined Satyricon temporarily to record the demo "The Forest is My Throne", but he later ended up joining the band full-time. He used blast beats during his early years with 1349 and Satyricon. He has since done more simplistic and mid-tempo with Satyricon.

During a tour, he was denied entry to North America by the US Department of Homeland Security. This was because he did not note that he was sentenced to 5 months for assault, for a bar fight in the early 1990s, when he was applying for his work visa. On the 1349 tours before 2008, Tony Laureano replaced him on drums. Joey Jordison and Trym Torson also performed with Satyricon during the bands North American tour dates. Frost was later able to join the band and perform again in the United States.
