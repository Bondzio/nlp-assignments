Trial of Conrad Murray

The trial of Conrad Murray (People of the State of California v. Conrad Robert Murray) was the American criminal trial of Michael Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray. Murray was charged with the involuntary manslaughter of the pop star for giving him an overdose of propofol. The trial started on September 27, 2011 at Los Angeles County Superior Court. In November 2011, the jury found Murray guilty. Murray was sentenced to four years in jail. In October 2013 Murray was released two years early. This was of California prison overcrowding, plus good behavior. After Murray was released from jail he was on "60 Minutes". He said that Jackson killed himself.
