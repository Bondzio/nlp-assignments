Panzerchrist

Panzerchrist is a Danish blackened death metal band. It was formed in 1993–1994 by Michael Enevoldsen (after he left Illdisposed) and Danish artist Lasse Hoile.

Panzerchrist recorded a few demos and was signed by Serious entertainment. "Six Seconds Kill" was released by Serious Entertainment in 1996, and in 1998 they released "Outpost Fort Europa". In 2000, Panzerchrist was joined by drummer Reno Killerich (ex-Exmortem, Vile, etc.) and Bo Summer (also of Illdisposed). They recorded "Soul Collector", which focused on World War II and had German lyrics. "Soul Collector" was released by Mighty Music in 2000.

In 2002, the band was joined by Frederik O'Carroll and Rasmus Henriksen. They began work on the violent "Room Service". It featured compositions that were very loud and fast, including a cover of the Metal Church classic "Metal Church". "Room Service" was recorded at Tue Madsen's "Antfarm Studios" (The Haunted, Illdisposed, Mnemic etc.) and was released by Mighty Music in 2003. The name of each song on the album "Room Service" are the first word(s) to be sung on each song. Each song on the album "Room Service" ends with the words "Death, forever panzer" – except the song "Metal Church", since it is a cover.

In 2006, Panzerchrist drummer Killerich and Karina Bundgaard, now on keyboards, rejoined for the recording of "Battalion Beast". This was released by Neurotic Records in 2006. This album features the words "Christ, thy name is panzer" at the end of each song.
