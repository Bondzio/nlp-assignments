Mahavira

Mahavira (599 BC-527 BC), also known as 'Vardhaman', was 24th Jain Tirthankara (Teaching God). He was born in 599 BC in Bihar state of India. He revived the Jain Dharma with five moral teachings under broad headings of Non-violence(Ahimsa), Truthfulness (Satya), Non-stealing (Asteya), Control of senses including mind (Brahmacharya), and Non-possessiveness (Aparigraha). 
Mahavira preached that "ahimsa" (non-injury) is the supreme virtue. He is not the founder of Jain religion. He was preceded by 23 Thirthankaras. However, he was the last Tirthankara in the current time cycle.
