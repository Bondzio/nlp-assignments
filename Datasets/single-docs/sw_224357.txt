David Chalmers

David Chalmers was born in 1966. He has lived in Australia all of his life.

Since 2004 he has been a professor of philosophy at the Australian National University.

He has challenged other philosophers to solve the "Hard Problem of consciousness". This is the problem of explaining the relationship between physical and mental states. For example, the brain has a physical way of processing information and this makes an experience, a mental state.
