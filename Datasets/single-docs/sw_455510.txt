Stop Crying Your Heart Out

"Stop Crying Your Heart Out" is the second single off English rock band Oasis' fifth studio album "Heathen Chemistry". The song was released on 17 May 2002. Jason Fox for NME said that "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" was the band's return to the "long lost humanism" of their 1996 single "Don't Look Back in Anger", because of Noel Gallagher's ability to lighten the mood of his audience when they are in need.

The song was composed in the key of B minor and used common time at 76 beats per minute.
