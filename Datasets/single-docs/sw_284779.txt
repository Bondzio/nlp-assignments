Meave Leakey

Meave G. Leakey (born Meave Epps, 28 July 1942 in London) is a renowned contemporary paleontologist. She studies the origin of mankind in West Africa. She is married to Richard Leakey, the son of Louis and Mary Leakey.

They have two children, Louise (born 1972) and Samira (born 1974). Her daughter Louise Leakey continues the family 'business' by conducting paleontological research.

Dr. Leakey's research team at Lake Turkana, Kenya made a discovery in 1999 that completely changed our understanding of early human ancestry. They found a 3.5 million-year-old skull and partial jaw thought to belong to a new branch of our early human family. She named the find "Kenyanthropus platyops", or flat-faced man of Kenya.
