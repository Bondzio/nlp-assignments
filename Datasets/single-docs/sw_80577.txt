Suchomimus

Suchomimus ("crocodile mimic") was a fish-eating (and meat-eating) large spinosaurid theropod dinosaur with a crocodile-like head. It lived 112 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous period in what is now Africa.

It was about 36 feet (11 m) long, about 12 feet tall, and walked on two powerful hind legs. This carnivore had short clawed arms with three fingers.
