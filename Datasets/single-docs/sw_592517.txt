Solomon Perel

Solomon Perel (born 21 April 1925), also Shlomo Perel or Sally Perel, is a German-born Israeli author and motivational speaker. He was born in Peine, Lower Saxony, Germany to a German Jewish family. He escaped persecution by the Nazis by pretending to be an ethnic German.

His life story is told in the 1990 movie "Europa Europa" loosely based on his autobiography "Ich war Hitlerjunge Salomon" ("I Was Hitler Youth Salomon").
