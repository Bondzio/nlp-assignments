Occluded front

An occluded front is a weather pattern. They bring cold weather and leave cold weather.It happens when a cold front joins with a warm front. For example, if the warm front is already there and the cold front comes along, the cold front is heavier than the warm front so will push it up. The warm front slides over the cold one. When the cold front catches up to the a warm front, the warm air is pushed up into the air. This is an occluded front. Cloud and rain form along the occluded front until temperatures become equal as the cold and warm air mix.
