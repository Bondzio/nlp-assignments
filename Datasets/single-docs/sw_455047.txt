Six Flags

Six Flags Entertainment Corporation is a company that operates 19 amusement parks in Mexico, the United States and Canada. The parks include theme parks, thrill parks, water parks and family entertainment centers. In 2011, 24.3 million people visited the parks.
The name Six Flags, comes from the flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. The original Six Flags park was (and still is) split into separate regions, such as the "Spain and Mexico" section which has Spanish-themed rides, attractions, and buildings.
