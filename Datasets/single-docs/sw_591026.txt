Gnetum

"Gnetum" is a group of plants. It is the only group of plants found in Gnetaceae. They are gymnosperms, meaning their seeds are "naked" and not covered unlike flowering plants.

Plants in "Gnetum" are evergreen. Most of them are woody vines, but some are big enough to be trees. They are found in warmer, tropical regions of the world. Some types, like "Gnetum oxycarpum", are in danger of dying out, because they only live in small areas and the forest that they grow on is being turned into land for farming.

"Gnetum" is part of a very old group of plants, called Gnetophyta. "Gnetum" may have been one of the first plants to be pollinated by insects, with other members of this group, known as "Ephedra" and "Welwitschia".

According to the Plant List, these are the species in "Gnetum":
