Battles of Lexington and Concord

The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first battles of the American Revolutionary War. They were between British soldiers, who wanted to take away the colonists' weapons and arrest John Hancock and Samuel Adams, and American colonists. They were fought in towns outside Boston, Massachusetts. These towns are Lexington, Massachusetts and Concord, Massachusetts.
The Patriots found out long before it happened and safely evacuated the place.
The first battle was fought on Lexington Green in Lexington. General Gage, along with 700 British soldiers, marched there to find and destroy hidden weapons. However, they were met by 70 minutemen. The battle lasted only a few minutes, but 8 minutemen died and 10 were hurt. Only 1 British soldier had been shot.
Then, the soldiers went to Concord. On the way back to Boston, they were ambushed by 400 minutemen. This time, Britain lost 250 soldiers, while only 90 Americans died. They went to Concord to seize gunpowder and weaponry stored by the militia.
