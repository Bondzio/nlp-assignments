Brenta (river)

The Brenta is an important river in northeastern Italy. It begins near the "Caldonazzo" and "Levico" lakes in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and flows for more of into the Adriatic Sea to the south of the city of Venice.

The Brenta river has a length of , and a drainage basin with an area of approximately . Its average yearly discharge is at Bassano del Grappa in the Vicenza province.

The Brenta, together with the Piave river, formed the Venetian Lagoon.

The Brenta river starts between the "Caldonazzo" and "Levico" lakes, two small lakes in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region, in the comune of Caldonazzo, Trento province, at an elevation of about . From here, the river flows through the "Valsugana", the valley that goes from Bassano del Grappa to Trento, first to the east and later to the south. In this part, the Brenta is joined by its main left tributary, the Cismon stream, in the "comune" Cismon del Grappa, province of Vicenza (the Bacchiglione river is larger but it joins the Brenta near the mouth).

After the "comune" of Bassano del Grappa, the river flows through the "Pianura Padana" (the "Valley of the Po river"). Finally, it flows into the Adriatic Sea, near the "comune" of Chioggia in the Metropolitan City of Venice. Near the mouth, Brenta is joined in the locality "Ca' Pasqua" by the Bacchiglione river.
