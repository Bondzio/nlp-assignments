Egoz (ship)

The Egoz (, literally: "walnut", originally: "Pisces") was a ship that sank in the Mediterranean Sea on 10 January 1961. It was carrying 44 Jewish emigrants sailing from Morocco. It also carried one Israeli that was deputy of the Israeli government, and two Spanish crew members. Only 22 bodies were found. They were buried at a Jewish cemetery in Morocco. In 1992, the 22 bodies were buried in the National Civil Cemetery of the State of Israel at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. An empty grave was built to honor the people who were never found. A memorial for all of the victims was built beside the graves.
