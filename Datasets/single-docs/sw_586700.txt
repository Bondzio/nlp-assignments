List of Welsh rulers

This is a list of Welsh rulers from 825 until 1282 when Wales was incorporated into England and then rulers from 1282 until 1707 of English Wales. These rulers were primarily prince of Wales but ruled the majority of Wales beginning in 825 which is where this list begins and the fact that in 825 England occupied land now in Wales as part of the English kingdoms (see Heptarchy)













Technically Wales didn't become a country and remained part of England until 1998 until the act of Devolution in 1998 making it it's own country although remaining part of the United Kingdom.
