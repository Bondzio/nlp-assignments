Joseph Monier

Joseph Monier (November 8, 1823, Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie, Franceâ€”March 13, 1906, Paris) was a French gardener. He was one of the inventors of reinforced concrete.

Monier did experiments with iron-wire reinforcement for his cement and concrete tubs and basins. He made the idea in 1867 and put his invention on exhibition the same year at the Paris Exposition.
