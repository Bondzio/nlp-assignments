Salem (TV series)

Salem is an American supernatural fiction drama television show. It was created by Brannon Braga and Adam Simon. The first episode was made public on April 20, 2014. "Salem" is WGN America's first scripted series. Janet Montgomery and Shane West are the main actors/actresses of the show. "Salem" is influenced by the Salem Witch Trials in the 17th century.

"Salem" is a fictional story that is based on the real Salem Witch Trials in colonial Massachusetts. The Massachusetts government at the time was dominated by conservative Puritan leaders. Unlike today there was little difference between church and state. 

In 1692 the Puritan colony was affected by young girls "crying out" accusations of devil worship against other members of the congregation. A mix of fear and superstition caused a hysteria among the Puritans that devil-worshiping witches were among them. A mob mentality caused people to torture and execute others women (and a few men) for no reason other than hysteria over the possibility of them being witches. Over 150 people were accused of being witches and placed on trial.

Salem, the WGN America series, reworks this history into a fictional story full of magic, witches as actual beings, and sexy characters. In the TV series the main characters, John Alden (Shane West) and Mary Sibley (Janet Montgomery), find themselves in love even though the whole town is in a frenzy over witch hunts. The New York Times review called it "perversely entertaining."

Most of the characters are based on the names of real people.
