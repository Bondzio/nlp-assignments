Dance-punk

Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk-funk) is a music genre that started in the late 1970s, and is closely related to the post-punk and No Wave movements. Groups, such as !!! and The Rapture are examples of Dance-punk. 
The Dance-punk genre has become popular again since it started as part of New York's underground scene from 1978 to 1982. The influence of bands like Talking Heads, Liquid Liquid, ESG, and Blondie can be heard throughout the genre.
