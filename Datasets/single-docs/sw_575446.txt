Mack Mattingly

Mack Francis Mattingly (born January 7, 1931) served one term as a United States senator from Georgia. He was the first Republican to serve in the U.S. Senate from that state since Reconstruction.

Mattingly was born in Anderson, Indiana. He studied at Indiana University. 

In 1980, Mattingly unseated longtime Democratic Senator Herman Talmadge, which was seen as an historic political upset.
