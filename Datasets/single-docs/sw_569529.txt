Sonthofen

Sonthofen is the most southerly town of Germany. It is located in the Oberallg√§u region of the Bavarian Alps. Oberstdorf is farther south but is not classified as a town. In 2005, Sonthofen was awarded "Alpenstadt des Jahres" (Alpine city of the year).

In World War II Sonthofen was bombed twice. This was because Adolf Hitler had built the "Ordensburg Sonthofen" in Sonthofen. Young boys were trained there for Nazi Party organisations. Sonthofen was given town rights on 18 August 1963.
