He was a pioneer of long-distance radio transmission. which he used to build up a radio telegraph system. Marconi is often named as the inventor of radio.

As an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company in Britain in 1897, Marconi became wealthy in the business of radio, mainly for ships at sea.
