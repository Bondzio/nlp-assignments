Foreign policy

A country's foreign policy (also called the international relations policy) is a set of goals about how the country will work with other countries economically, politically, socially and militarily. Foreign policy also involves dealing with groups that are not countries but that are still important. These are called "non-state actors", and might include religious groups, large companies, or even terrorist groups. The study of foreign relations is known as foreign policy analysis (FPA) and the work is called diplomacy. Most counties have a foreign minister who directs these things.

Foreign policy means the policy of nurturing and promoting one's national interest while interacting with other countries. Every country decides on the framework of its foreign policy and according to its principles, it takes decisions about how and what kind of transactions it would carry out with other nations.
