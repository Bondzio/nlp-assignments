WrestleMania XXX

WrestleMania XXX was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by WWE. It was held on April 6, 2014 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was the thirtieth WrestleMania event held by the WWE.

The main event saw Daniel Bryan defeat both Randy Orton and Batista in a triple threat match to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Wrestlemania XXX also saw Brock Lesnar defeat The Undertaker and breaking his 21 year undefeated streak at WrestleMania. 

At the "Royal Rumble" on January 26, 2014, Batista was the winner of the 30-man Royal Rumble match and secured his spot to headline WrestleMania XXX against whomever the champion is after the "Elimination Chamber".

On February 21, it was announced by the WWE that Hulk Hogan was returning to the company and was going to host WrestleMania.

On February 24, Brock Lesnar returned along with Paul Heyman and showed up to "Raw". They complained about not being in the title match at WrestleMania. To appease them, Triple H handed them a contract which gave Lesnar a match with anybody at WrestleMania as long as it wasn't Orton or Batista. Lesnar and Heyman didn't like this open challenge and tried to leave because they thought that nobody would be would not be a big enough challenge. Before they could leave, The Undertaker returned and stared Lesnar down. Undertaker looked at the WrestleMania sign and Lesnar signed the contract. Lesnar poked the pen against against Undertaker's chest for him to sign and Undertaker stabbed the pen through Lesnar's hand as well as chokeslamming Lesnar through the table afterwards.
