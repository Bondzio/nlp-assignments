Wario Land: The Shake Dimension

Wario Land: The Shake Dimension (known as Wario Land: Shake It! in North America) is a platform video game made by Good-feel and to be published by Nintendo for the Wii game console.

"The Shake Dimension" is a sidescrolling platform game that uses 3D cel-shading to make it look hand-drawn. It stars Wario, and the player controls him by holding the Wii Remote like an NES controller. Wario can jump, do a shoulder bash, and at certain times, can use the Wii Remote's motion features to shake stuff or control stuff.
