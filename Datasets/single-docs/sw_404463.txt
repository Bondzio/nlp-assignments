Muslim Patrol

The Muslim Patrol was a gang of British Muslims who attempted to establish Sharia law in parts of the United Kingdom. The gang filmed their activities and posted them on YouTube. They attacked people who had alcohol or drugs, prostitutes, and people who they thought were gay or not wearing enough clothes. Five men were arrested as part of an investigation into the gang.
