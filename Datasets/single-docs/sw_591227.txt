Bus station

A bus station is a building where buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. A bus station is larger than a bus stop, which is usually a place on the roadside where buses stop. Some bus stations are terminal stations, which means that station is the end of the route. Other stations are called transfer stations, which is a station where the routes continue.

Bus stations can be outside, or inside, above or below ground. Some are under shopping centres.

Some bus stations have seats, toilets, travel centres and electronic passenger information systems (which show what time the buses are coming).
