Gustav Klimt

Gustav Klimt (14 July 1862 – 6 February 1918) was an Austrian Symbolist painter. He was one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. His major works include paintings, murals, sketches, and other art objects. Many of them are on display in the Vienna Secession gallery. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism — nowhere is this more apparent than in his numerous drawings in pencil (see "Mulher sentada", below).

Klimt died of influenza in Vienna.
