Swedish Ski Games

The Swedish Ski Games () is an annual cross-country skiing event in Sweden. It was started in Sundsvall in 1947. It was moved to Falun in 1959. Ski jumping and Nordic combined skiing were included up to 1991 as a recurring event. Alpine skiing was also included between 1950-1953 (in Ã…re). Biathlon was included in 1984. The event is usually held in February or March as one of the final World Cup competitions during the season. The event is usually held at Lugnet. Sometimes the lack of snow has required the event to be moved to other places in Sweden.
