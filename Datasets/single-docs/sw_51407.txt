There are different versions of sportscars. There are cars with the motor in the front and those with rear wheel drive. Examples are the Chevrolet Corvette or the Honda S2000. There are also cars with the motor behind the passengers in the middle of the car. One of the first cars like this was the Lamborghini Miura. Porsche uses a different layout. The motor in a Porsche 911 is in the back, behind the rear wheels. Since the 1980s a lot of sportscars also have Four wheel drive. The motor in the front and front wheel drive is only used in a few sportscars.
