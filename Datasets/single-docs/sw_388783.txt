Donkey Kong Land 2

Donkey Kong Land 2 is a Game Boy video game that is a part of the "Donkey Kong" video game series. This game was released in 1996 by Nintendo and was developed by Rare, Ltd.. There is a predecessor to this game named "Donkey Kong Land" and a sequel called "Donkey Kong Land III".

The plot is similar to "<nowiki>'</nowiki>"s plot. It has King K. Rool once again kidnapping Donkey Kong, who can only be freed if Diddy Kong gives the bananas from the Banana Hoard to K. Rool.

This game has seven total worlds in the game, as opposed to eight in "Donkey Kong Country 2". The second and third worlds (Crocodile Cauldron and Krem Quay) of "Donkey Kong Country 2" have been merged into Krem Cauldron, possibly to save memory on the game's cartridge. Like "Donkey Kong Country 2", there is a Lost World which can be unlocked if Diddy and Dixie pay Klubba fifteen Kremkoins to a level per world. The worlds include:
