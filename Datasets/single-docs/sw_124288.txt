In Utero

In Utero was the third album by the American grunge band Nirvana. It was also the last album that was released before Nirvana's singer, Kurt Cobain, died six months later from a shotgun wound to the head, inflicted by himself. The album got good reviews. It has sold over 15 million copies.

Nirvana performed "Rape Me" on television before "In Utero" was released. Many people thought the song was offensive, and the song was almost not released on the album. When the album was released, the Wal-Mart version called the song "Waif Me."
