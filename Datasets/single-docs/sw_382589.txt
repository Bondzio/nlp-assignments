Assemblies of God

The Assemblies of God is a United States-based Christian denomination; a large group of Pentecostal churches. There are over 64 million members in over 200 countries.

The AG is Trinitarian. They view the Bible as divinely inspired. The Bible provides the rules of faith and conduct. Baptism by immersion is practiced. Baptism is understood as an outward sign of an inward change. The change is from being dead in sin to being alive in Christ. Communion is also practiced. The Assemblies of God also places a strong emphasis on the fulfillment of the Great Commission and believes that this is the main calling of the church.

The next World congress will be held in Springfield, Missouri in August 2014.
