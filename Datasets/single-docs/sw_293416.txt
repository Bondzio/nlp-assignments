Stonewall riots

The Stonewall riots were a series of riots in New York City in 1969. They happened after the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gaybar in Greenwich Village. After this, many homosexuals protested the fact they were persecuted by the police. They are seen as the start of the Gay Rights Movement.
