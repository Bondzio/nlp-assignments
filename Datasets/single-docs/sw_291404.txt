Battle of Moscow

The Battle of Moscow (, ) is a name given by Soviet historians to two periods of fighting on a 600Â km area of the Eastern Front during World War II. It took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defenses made the Germans unable to attack on Moscow, the Soviet capital, which was one of the Axis's primary military and political objectives in the invasion of the Soviet Union.

The German strategic offensive named Operation Typhoon was planned to attack Moscow from the north and south. The Soviets reacted by sending in more reserve from the Far East. Shortly, German attacks were stopped, and the Soviets began counter-attack and forced to push the Axis back.
