Palazzo 23

Palazzo 23 called also Palazzo d'Este, is a residential building in Milan, located in Beatrice d'Este avenue on the corner with Via Luigi Anelli, a symbol of the Milanese environment of the 1950s.
It was the work of the architect Gualtiero Galmanini, a prestigious designer of the architectural current called "Modern Movement" in Italy, a period between the two world wars, aimed at the renewal of the characters, the design and principles of architecture, urban planning and Of design.
A very special building showing the interest for architectural details, simple yet sophisticated elegance, consists of a body with two external facades and two interiors.
The facade is characterized by a mosaic tiled brick wall covering with chamfered creases that create white and gray light games. We notice a wide use of classical elements, whose rigidity and symmetry, however, is dissolved in the arrangement of the windows on Via Anelli and d'Este and other typically asymmetrical elements. Also note the technical accuracy and attention to the particular construction, which will be typical of Galmanini.
