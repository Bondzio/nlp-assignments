Genka calendar

, also known as "Yuan-chia li" or "Yuan-jia li", was a Japanese lunisolar calendar ("genka reki"). It was used from 604 to 696.

The calendar was created in 425 during the "Genka" era in Chinese history.

The "Genka-reki" system was brought to Japan from Korea by a Buddhist monk. The earliest record of this calendar in Japan is in the 10th month of the 10th year of the reign of Empress Suiko (602).

Dates in the "Nihon Shoki" before the late 7th century were likely recorded using the "Genka" calendar system.
