Anglo-Egyptian Sudan

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was the name of the Sudan when it was a colony of the United Kingdom and Egypt. It was officially under the joint rule of both countries, but really the British controlled the government from the beginning. Every Governor was British, and all decisions about the country were made by the British, although many of the administrators of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were Egyptians. The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was created in 1899 when the Egyptian Army under Herbert Kitchener recaptured the Sudan, which was before an Egyptian colony, from the Madhists, a group of Islamic rebels against Egypt.
