Missak Manouchian

Missak Manouchian (1 September 1906 - 21 February 1944) was a French-Armenian poet, a militant in the MOI ("Immigrant Workforce Movement") in the Paris region. He was 37 years old when executed by the Nazis for his Résistance work.

Although Manouchian became well known for his leadership in the French Resistance, he was, above all, an intellectual and a talented poet.

Manouchian posthumously was awarded by the Legion of Honor highest order. In 2009 Robert Guédiguian directed a film, "The Army of Crime", dedicated to Manouchian and his group.
