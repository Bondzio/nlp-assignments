Parliament of Great Britain

The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707. This was because of the ratification of the Acts of Union 1707 by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved (or ended) the separate English and Scottish parliaments. The British parliament was located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Act of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom. It became effective 1 January 1801.
