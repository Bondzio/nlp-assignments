Kōzuke Province

The ancient capital city of the province was near Maebashi. 

In the Nara period, Kōzuke was part of Keno Province. This was changed in the reforms of the Taihō Code in 701.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Kōzuke Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Ichinomiyanukisaki jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Kōzuke.
