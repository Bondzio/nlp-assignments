Inception

Inception is a 2010 American science fiction action heist movie written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a thief who collects information from the subconscious mind of his victims while they dream. Cobb has two children but cannot visit them. He is offered a chance to go back to his children in exchange for one last job: performing "inception", which is planting a new idea, into the mind of his client's main business competitor. 

The idea behind "Inception" was first developed over nine years before it was released. In 2001, Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about dream-stealers, presenting the idea to Warner Bros. At first the story was written as a heist movie, based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation. 
Because Nolan wanted to have more experience working with big-scale movies, he chose to work on "Batman Begins", "The Prestige" and "The Dark Knight". He spent six months polishing up the script for "Inception" before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009. Filming spanned six countries and four continents, beginning in Tokyo on June 19, 2009 and finishing in Canada in late November of the same year. Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the music for the movie. 

"Inception" was officially budgeted at $160 million, a cost which was shared between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures. Nolan's success with "The Dark Knight" helped gain the movie $100 million to spend on advertising. "Inception" was first screened in London on July 8, 2010 and was shown in standard and IMAX theatres on July 14, 2010. The movie had a lot of positive reviews and earned over $21 million on its opening day, and $62.7 million in the first weekend.
