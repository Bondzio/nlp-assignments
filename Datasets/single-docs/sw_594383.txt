Numberblocks

Numberblocks is a British children's CGI-animated TV series. It debuted on CBeebies on 23 January 2017. It is animated by Blue-Zoo Productions, the studio that also produces "Alphablocks", which is related. It is a show to teach children under the age of 6 how to count and recognise numbers from 1 to 5, and later to 10.

"Numberblocks" follows the adventures of ten anthropomorphic block characters in Numberland, with the number of blocks determining which numeral they stand for and a tiny black floating numerical figure above them to show how many blocks they are made of, called a numberling. When one of the blocks jumps on top of another, they transform into a different character to make a new number. The show tries to help preschool children learn numeracy skills, especially how to count and add up.
