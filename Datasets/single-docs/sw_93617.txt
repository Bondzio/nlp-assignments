Saarbrücken District

The Regionalverband Saarbrücken is a "Kommunalverband besonderer Art", that is, it is a special mix of a rural district and a district free city. It is located in the south of the Saarland, Germany.

The district Saarbrücken was originally created in 1816.
In 1974 the district and the district-free city Saarbrücken were merged, and the new administrative body was named "Stadtverband Saarbrücken". Although it's not a district like others, most of its administrative tasks are same as those of a district.

The Saar River flows through the district, through the city Saarbrücken in the centre of the district.
