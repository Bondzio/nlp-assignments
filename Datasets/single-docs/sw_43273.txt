Traffic light

Traffic lights (or traffic signals) are lights used to control the movement of traffic. They are placed on roads at intersections and crossings. The different colors of lights tell drivers what to do.

Traffic lights change their colors in the same order every time. In most English-speaking countries, traffic lights usually change in this order:

Garrett A. Morgan, an African-American inventor, invented one of the first traffic lights. He was one of the first people to get a patent for a traffic light.

William Potts, a police officer, invented the first traffic light with three colors.
