Dan Quayle

James Danforth "Dan" Quayle (born February 4, 1947) was the 44th Vice President of the United States. He served with President George H. W. Bush (1989â€“1993).

Quayle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents were Martha Corinne (nee Pulliam) and James Cline Quayle. He has often been incorrectly referred to as "James Danforth Quayle III". In his memoirs, he points out that his birth name was simply James Danforth Quayle. The name Quayle originates from the Isle of Man, where his great-grandfather was born.

His maternal grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, was a rich and influential publishing magnate who founded Central Newspapers, Inc., owner of over a dozen major newspapers such as "The Arizona Republic" and "The Indianapolis Star". James C. Quayle moved his family to Arizona in 1955 to run part of the family's publishing business. While his family was very wealthy, Quayle was less rich; his total net worth by the time of his election in 1988 was less than $1 million.

Quayle and his wife are Presbyterians. He currently lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona.
