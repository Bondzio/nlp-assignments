Linda Marie McMahon (n√©e Edwards; born October 4, 1948) is an American professional wrestling magnate and politician. She is the 25th and current Administrator of the Small Business Administration since February 14, 2017. McMahon was active with the WWE (WWF until 2002) from 1980 to 2009. She has been married to Vince McMahon since 1966.

McMahon was born Linda Marie Edwards in New Bern, North Carolina, the daughter of Evelyn and Henry Edwards. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from East Carolina University.

McMahon was active with the WWE from 1980 to 2009. During this time, the company grew from a small regional business in the North East to a large multinational corporation. 

As President and later CEO of the company, she created the company's civic programs, "Get REAL" and "Smackdown Your Vote".

McMahon and her husband became wealthy through WWE's success, and the McMahon family name is now synonymous with the professional wrestling industry.
