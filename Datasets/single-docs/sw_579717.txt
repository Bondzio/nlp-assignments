Iron filings

Iron filings are tiny rods of iron. They are often used to show the effects of magnetic fields. Since iron is magnetic, the filings become small bar magnets. Each filing attracts other filings, so the filings eventually look like the magnetic field the original magnet has.

Iron filings are made accidentally when working iron. Iron filingsâ€™ only uses are to teach magnetic fields, and to be eaten for people who need iron.
