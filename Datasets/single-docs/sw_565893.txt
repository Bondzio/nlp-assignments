Nobby Stiles

Norbert Peter "Nobby" Stiles MBE (born 18 May 1942) is a retired English footballer. He was born in Collyhurst, Manchester.

Stiles played for England for five years, winning 28 caps and scoring 1 goal. He played every minute of England's victorious 1966 FIFA World Cup campaign. His best performance in an England shirt was probably the semi-final of that tournament against Portugal, where he was given the job of marking the prolific Eusébio. His tough performance resulted in Eusébio being practically nullified for the entire game. 

Stiles also played very well in the final, which England won 4–2 against West Germany. His post-match celebration has become one of the most famous images in English sport history. The sight of Stiles dancing on the Wembley pitch, holding the World Cup trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other, has lived for decades.

On 24 November 2013, it was announced that Stiles was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
