Absolute temperature

Absolute temperature, also called thermodynamic temperature, is the temperature of an object on a scale where 0 is taken as absolute zero. Absolute temperature scales are "Kelvin" (degree units Celsius) and "Rankine" (degree units Fahrenheit).

Absolute zero is the temperature at which a system is in the state of lowest possible (minimum) energy. As molecules approach this temperature their movements drop towards zero. It is the lowest temperature a gas thermometer can measure. No electronic devices work at this temperature.

Common temperatures in the absolute scale are:

To convert from the Celsius scale into the absolute temperature, you add 273.15 and change °C to K. To get a temperature on the absolute scale to the Celsius scale, subtract 273.15 and change K to °C.
This is normally used in the science world.
The value if Absolute temperature is 0K.
Conversion

Celsius to Kelvin: K=C+273

Kelvin to Celsius : C=K-273

Fahrenheit to Rankine: R=F+460
