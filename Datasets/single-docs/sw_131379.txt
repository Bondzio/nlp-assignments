Scott Sundquist

Scott Sundquist is an American musician. He was a drummer for the grunge band Soundgarden during the mid-1980s.

In 1985, Soundgarden was a recently formed three-piece band with Chris Cornell on vocals and drums, Kim Thayil on guitar, and Hiro Yamamoto on bass. The band chose Sundquist to be their drummer so Cornell could do the singing. They traveled around playing various gigs with this lineup for about a year. Then they recorded three songs for a C/Z Records compilation album of grunge music by Soundgarden and five other bands, which was called Deep Six and was released in March 1986. This album contains the only recorded Soundgarden material with Sundquist.

Sundquist, who prior to joining the band had been friends with Cornell, was asked to join the band so that Cornell could focus on singing. In 1986, Sundquist left the band to spend time with his family, He stayed friends with Cornell and Thayil after he left the band.
