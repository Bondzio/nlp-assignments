Suō Province

The province had borders with Aki, Iwami, and Nagato Provinces.

The ancient capital city of the province was Hōfu. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Suō Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Tamanoya jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Suō.
