Convergent boundary

A convergent boundary is where two or more tectonic plates collide with each other causing massive earth movements. The Himalayas were formed by such a collision. Earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. This is because of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, 

The diagram illustrates some differences between the two types of subduction.
