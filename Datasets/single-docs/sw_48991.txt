Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia

Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia (b. June 10, 1897, Russia) was a daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna. She was a sister of Olga, Anastasia, Maria, and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. Her friends said she was more beautiful than her sisters. She was a Red Cross nurse during World War I. She was practical and liked to help her mother. Her religion was Russian Orthodox. She spoke Russian, English and French fluently.

Tatiana was killed by Bolsheviks on July 17, 1918 with the rest of her family and some of their servants, during the Russian Revolution. Their mass grave was found later in Siberia after some speculation that one of her sisters, mainly presumed to be Anastasia, had escaped. Tatiana and her family were then buried in St. Petersburg, Russia on July 17, 1998. They were made saints by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.
