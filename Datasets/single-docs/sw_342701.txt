Watchdog timer

A watchdog timer is a component of an electronic system that makes sure the system is operating properly. These components can either be done as a piece of hardware or as software. Depending on the intended use, they either signal that a system is not working properly, or they make a system work properly again. A watchdog timer may cause a system to reset itself to its initial state.
