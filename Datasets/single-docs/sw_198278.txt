National Film and Sound Archive

The National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) is Australiaâ€™s audiovisual archive. This is where all Australia's old movies and sound recordings are kept. The NFSA is responsible for developing, saving, looking after, promoting and providing access to a national collection of movie and sound materials. The collection has works made in the late 19th century when the recorded sound and movie industries were just beginning to those made in the present day.

The NFSA started in 1935 as the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library which was then part of the Commonwealth National Library. It became an independent statutory authority as the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia in 2008.

It is located in Canberra, Australia's capital city.
