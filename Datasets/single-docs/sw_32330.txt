Islamic Revolution

The Islamic Revolution occurred in 1979, in the Muslim country Iran. The reason for the revolution (a violent overthrow of a government) was that many leftist and Islamist Iranians disliked the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. 

Ayatollah Khomeini organized protests to overthrow the government and all of its after descendants. Khomeini became the new leader of Iran. The government was made a republic and a theocracy. Also religious officials held power. 

Shortly after the revolution, Iraq invaded Iran. This war ended in 1988. Since 1988 Iran is officially known as the Islamic Republic of Iran. Supporters of the revolution are still the leaders of the country.

The Islamic Revolution impacted other Islamic countries by showing how to fight against Westernization. The revolution caused some people to leave Iran and feel ashamed of their culture. Nearly 60,000 protesters and revolutionaries died during the war.
