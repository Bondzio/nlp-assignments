Hyracotherium

Hyracotherium was previously called "Eohippus" (meaning "dawn horse"). It is a Eurasian species ancestral to the horse, but not the same animal as "Eohippus". 

"Hyracotherium" lived during the early Eocene epoch, about 5545 million years ago. It lived in the northern hemisphere in Asia and Europe. The first fossils of this tiny horse were found in England by Richard Owen in 1841 and named "Hyracotherium".

The type species, "H. leporinum", is now regarded as a paleothere, ancestral to both horses and brontotheres. "Eohippus" has been brought back as a name, to describe the early proto-horse found in North America. The main stream of horse evolution occurred on the North American continent.
