Old town

An Old Town of a city or town is its historic center or district. It is often the older town the newer parts were built around. It may also be an area built to resemble the older original town. Old towns usually have historical and architectural value that make them worth restoring. In Europe old towns are usually the medieval towns or villages that the newer city was built up around. Old towns may have cobblestone streets, old churches, and balconies hanging over narrow back streets. Because they are restrictive traffic traps many old town districts do not allow motor vehicles.
