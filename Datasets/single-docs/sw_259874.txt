Deus ex machina

Deus ex machina is the Latin version of an ancient Greek phrase "ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός".

The phrase means "the god from the machine". It comes from the theatre of ancient Greece, which had a kind of crane for delivering gods onto the stage on wires. 

By extension, the term means a plot device whereby a seemingly overwhelming problem is suddenly solved by means which are arbitrary, and do not follow from the logic of the narrative (story).

For example, in Euripides' play "Alcestis", the heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and to Admetus. A more frequently cited example is Euripides' "Medea" in which the "deus ex machina" is used to describe Medea, who has just killed people and babies, away from her husband Jason to the safety and civilization of Athens.

Aristotle criticized this device in his "Poetics." He argued that the resolution of a plot must arise without something outside the play, following from previous action of the play:
