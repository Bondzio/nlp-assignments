Wester Ross

Wester Ross is part of the Scottish county of Ross and Cromarty. It is in the northwest highlands. It has some of the most spectacular scenery in Great Britain, and is a tourist attraction.

Wester Ross is geographically the western watershed of Ross-shire. Administrative and political boundaries have been changed a number of times.

The mountains are made of a very old Precambrian rock known as the Torridonian sandstone formation. It was laid down in the Neoproterozoic era.
