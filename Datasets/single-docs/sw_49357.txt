Manufacturing

Manufacturing is producing goods out of raw materials. It is a branch of industry. It includes making very big, complicated things that take a lot of steps to finish. Often machines are involved in manufacturing.

In the past products were made by handicraft workers using tools and manual labor. In modern times, most manufacturing jobs got replaced by automated manufacturing machines, which made the products much faster and in turn - cheaper than humans could.
