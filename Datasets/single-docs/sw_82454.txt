1986 Formula One season

The 1986 Formula One season was the 37th of the championship. The champion was Alain Prost in a close battle. It started on March 23, and ended on October 26 with sixteen races.

This was the first year that turbocharged were required. Formula One had baned naturally aspirated (atmospheric) engines. Until the planed engine change in 2014, this was the only year turbos were required. The ban on atmospheric engines was lifted in 1987. In 1989, all forced induction engines (turbochargers or supercharge) were banned.
