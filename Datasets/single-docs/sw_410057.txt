Paul Bekker

Paul Bekker (September 11, 1882, Berlin â€“ March 7, 1937, New York) was one of the most influential German music critics of the 20th century.

The music library of Yale University houses the "Paul Bekker Collection", which has many letters, documents, receipts, photographs, printed scores and other forms of miscellany, some of which have great historical and musicological value.
