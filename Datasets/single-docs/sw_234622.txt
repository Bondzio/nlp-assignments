Emperor Ankō

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

The "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki" record that Ankō was the second son of Emperor Ingyō.

Some accounts report that Ankō murdered his own father.

Very little is known about the events of Ankō's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.

It is believed that Ankō was murdered in the third year of his reign.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ankō.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
