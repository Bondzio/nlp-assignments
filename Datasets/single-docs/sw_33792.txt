Hymen

The hymen (also called maidenhead) is a membrane-like tissue that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening allowing virgins to menstruate. The hymen has no known use. Since the hymen usually breaks after having sexual intercourse, women with unbroken hymens were considered virgins. However, a woman's hymen can break while engaging in some sports as well. Some women are also born without a hymen. 

There are several different types of hymen. In about 1 in 2,000 females, the hymen does not develop at all: this is called an "imperforate hymen".

When a fetus is developing, there is no vaginal opening. The hymen comes from the skin covering the vagina at that time.

In young babies, the hymen is thick and pink. This is because the mother is giving the baby hormones through breast feeding which keeps it thick. In adolescent girls, the hymen becomes thin, smooth and delicate because she has stopped taking in hormones. The hymen becomes very sensitive and can easily cause pain if touched. From puberty, the hymen gets thicker again and becomes pale pink. This is because of the hormone estrogen.
