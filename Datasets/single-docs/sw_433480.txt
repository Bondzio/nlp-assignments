Nonverbal learning disorder

A nonverbal learning disorder (or nonverbal learning disability), or NVLD, is a neurological problem. It can cause lower verbal skills, lower motor, social skills and other areas. A person with NVLD also has problems in non-verbal problem solving, understanding humor and rote learning (remembering something by repeating it).

NVLD is linked with autism spectrum disorders, mostly autism or Asperger's. Most people with either high-functioning autism or Asperger fit this actual type. This condition, though, is also tied to depression and anxiety.

Nonverbal learning disabilities affect one in ten learning disabled children.
