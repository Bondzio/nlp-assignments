Larry Griffin

Larry Griffin (September 23, 1954 - June 21, 1995) - was a man accused of killing 19-year-old Quintin Moss. The alleged crime happened in Saint Louis, Missouri, on June 26, 1980. On June 21, 1995, the State of Missouri executed Griffin by lethal injection. He is one of the few people who were put to death partly based on the testimony of a witness who had been at the crime scene. There were others including Garay Graham who was executed on June 22 2000 when George Bush & TX appeals board refused to give him life in prison instead. He maintained his innocence until he was executed for the crime. There are groups to this day trying to reopen his case, prove him innocent.
