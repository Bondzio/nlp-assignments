Salam

Salam or salaam (, "salam") is an Arabic word that literally means "peace", but is also used as a general greeting, above all in Arabian countries and by the Muslims, but also in other countries where hamzaIslam is important. 

This word appears also in longer greetings, as "assalamoe `alaykum" () to which it is possible to answer: "wa`alaykum assalam". In addition, "As-Salam" is one of the 99 Names of God. 

The Hebrew version is "shalom", that in Israel is used in the same way like "salaam".
