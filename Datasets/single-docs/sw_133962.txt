Ancient Olympic Games

The ancient Olympics were played in the honour of God Zeus. The men had to be fit as they often had to go to war. Women were not allowed to participate or see the competitions.
The Ancient Olympic Games were a series of athletic competitions held between the city-states of Ancient Greece. They used to be called the Olympic Games (; "Olympiakoi Agones") until the modern day Olympic Games started. The Ancient Olympic Games began in 776 BCE in Olympia, Greece. They ran until 393 CE and then the stadium got buried due to landslides and other natural disasters.
Prizes at the games were olive wreaths, palm branches and woollen ribbons.
