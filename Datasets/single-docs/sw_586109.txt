Yellow Line (CTA)

The Yellow Line, formerly known as the Skokie Swift, is part of the Chicago Transit Authority's "L" system in Chicago, Illinois. The route runs from the Howard Terminal on the north side of Chicago, through the southern part of Evanston and to the Dempster Terminal in Skokie, Illinois, making one intermediate stop at Oakton Street in Skokie.

At Howard, Yellow Line passengers can transfer to the Purple or Red Lines of the CTA. The Yellow Line is the only CTA line that does not go to Chicago Loop.
