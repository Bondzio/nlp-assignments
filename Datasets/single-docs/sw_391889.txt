Juan Mora Fernández

Juan Mora Fernández (1784 San José - 1854) was Costa Rica's first elected head of state in 1825. He was considered a liberal and decided to move the capital from Cartago to San José. He is remembered for instituting land reform. He followed a progressive course.

As a consequence of his land reform, he created an elite class of powerful coffee barons. The barons eventually overthrew one of his later successors.
