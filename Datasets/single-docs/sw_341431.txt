Bromance

A bromance is a close non-sexual relationship between two (or more) men, a form of homosocial intimacy. Bromance is a portmanteau word of "bro" or "brother" and "romance". The word was created in the 1990s to describe the sort of relationships that develop between skateboarders who spend a great deal of time together.

"Womance" is the female flip side of bromance. It means a close non-sexual relationship between two (or more) women, a form of homosocial intimacy.
