Hayabusa (wrestler)

Ezaki debuted for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) at the 1994 Super J Cup, losing in the first round to Jushin Thunder Liger. He started wrestling under the Hayabusa gimmick in 1993 while he was working in Mexico.

In October 2001, Ezaki suffered a career-ending injury when he tried to perform a springboard moonsault off the middle rope, lost his footing, landed on his head, and cracked two of his vertebrae which left him paralyzed. In 2015, Ezaki had regained the use of his legs and was able to stand on his own and walk with a cane.

On 3 April 2015, Hayabusa took part in a press conference which announced the return of FMW. He had served as the executive producer of the promotion.

On 3 March 2016, Ezaki died from a subarachnoid hemorrhage at age 47. He was found dead in his home by the owner of a tavern that he was supposed to do a small concert for that day, but did not show up.
