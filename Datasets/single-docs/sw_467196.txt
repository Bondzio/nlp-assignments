<poem>
Serene and happy, brave and daring,
Let us sing, soldiers, the battle hymn.
Our voices shall astonish the world
Which will see on us the children of the Cid.

Soldiers, the country calls us to the fight.
Let us swear for her to succeed or to die.

Never saw the world more noble daring,
Nor any day greater valor was shown,
Than that, inflamed, we showed at the fire
Awaken in Riego the love of his land.

Soldiers, the country calls us to the fight.
Let us swear for her to conquer or to die.

The war trumpet echoes to the winds;
Affrighting the greedy, the cannon now roars.
at Mars, wrathful provokes the audacity
And the ingenuity of our nation.

Soldiers, the country calls us to the fight.
Let us swear for her to succeed or to die.
