Forest of Secrets (Warriors)

Forest of Secrets is the third book in the series "Warriors".

"Forest of Secrets" takes place in the New Forest in England, with just one change: a mountain exists in the book but not in reality.

Fireheart, a ThunderClan warrior, still looks for a way to make Tigerclaw get seen by his true personality. Graystripe, another ThunderClan warrior, is still in love with a RiverClan warrior, Silverstream, and eventually she has kits, but dies in the process. Fireheart and Graystripe find Ravenpaw, a loner who is no longer an apprentice of ThunderClan, and get the true story. Fireheart uses the story to try and frame Tigerclaw, but fails. Eventually, Tigerclaw brings a band of rogues into the camp, and tries to kill Bluestar. Fireheart rescues Bluestar and Tigerclaw gets banished from ThunderClan. Fireheart is deputy in his place and Graystripe takes his kits to RiverClan. Bluestar has gone crazy by that time and Fireheart tries his best to calm her.
