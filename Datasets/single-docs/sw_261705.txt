Jjigae

Jjigae (찌개) is a Korean food like stew. There are many different kinds of "jjigae". However, it is usually made with meat, seafood or vegetables in a broth flavored with "gochujang", "doenjang", or "ganjang". "Jjigae" can also be well seasoned with red chili pepper and served boiling hot. 

A Korean meal almost always includes either a "jjigae" or a "guk" (국, soup). In the Joseon Dynasty "jjigae" was called "jochi".

Different kinds of "jjigae" are often called according to their main ingredients such as "saengseon jjigae" (생선찌개). "Saengseon" means fish. "Dubu jjigae" (두부찌개) is made from "dubu" (that is, tofu).
