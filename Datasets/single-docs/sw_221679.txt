Martial eagle

The martial eagle ("Polemaetus bellicosus") is a bird of prey. It lives in Africa and is the biggest eagle in Africa, 76 to 96 cm (30–38 in) long, and its wingspan is 188–260 cm (6.2–8.5 ft) long.

Because it is so big, it can kill a small antelope called duikers and eat it, but it could not carry it up to its big nest in the tree.
