Villers-en-Ouche

Villers-en-Ouche is a commune in north-western France. It is in the Orne department.

In the commune is a large house or mansion, called the Château de Villers-en-Ouche. The château was first built in the late-1400s. It was re-built in 1610 by the family "La Chapelle". The main building has a Mansard roof, decorated with 5 skylight windows, which replaced a higher roof that was burned in 1741.

The grounds include a French style garden and a 10-hectare park. In 2009, the chateau was honored with Emile Garcin-Paris Prize for work on the pigeon house, which was built in the 15th century.
