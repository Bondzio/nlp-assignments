Cranberry

A cranberry is a fruit. It grows on evergreen dwarf shrubs. Cranberries are in the genus "Vaccinium", and its subgenus "Oxycoccus". In some classification methods, they are regarded as a genus in their own right.

Cranberry plants grow in acidic bogs in cooler areas of the northern hemisphere. They are low creeping shrubs up to seven feet long, from two to eight inches high. They have slender and wiry stems with small leaves which are evergreen with dark pink flowers. Cranberries are usually eaten during Thanksgiving in the United States. They are also eaten in Europe and some parts of South America 

Cranberries are strong commercial crops for certain U.S. states. They are turned into juice, sauce or jam. Since 2000, cranberries have been marketed as superfruit due to their antioxidant and nutrient qualities.
