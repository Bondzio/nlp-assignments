Counter-Strike: Source

Counter-Strike Source is a first-person shooter computer game developed by Valve Corporation. The game normally involves 2 teams, one called 'Terrorists' or 'T' for short and 'Counter Terrorists' or 'CT' for short. The two teams have different guns and objectives. For example, Terrorists can use the AK-47 and Counter Terrorists can use the M4A1.

The game started off as a modification of "Half-Life", called "Counter-Strike". Its popularity grew enough that Valve made it into a retail game. "Counter-Strike: Source" is essentially the same game on the Source engine. It remains one of the most popular online shooter games in the world. The game has real-life weapons. Most of them are still used today.

There are two officials modes, bomb-defusal and hostage rescue. The aim of the game generally is to kill the opposing force and carrying out other objectives such as defusing bombs and rescuing hostages.

These changes called modifications or "mods" for short, are created by the game's players generally and are not regarded as official changes. There are many mods such as Warcraft, Deathmatch, Gungame, Zombie Survival, and surf.
