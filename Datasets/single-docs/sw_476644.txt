Jack Thompson (activist)

Jack Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and former lawyer. He is known for being an activist against sex and violence in video games. He has also fought against rap music, mainly because of its obscenity.

In July 2008, Thompson was permanently disbarred, meaning his license to be a lawyer was taken away. That was done because of bad behavior and saying things that weren't true to tribunals.

Thompson was born in Cleveland, Ohio.
