Monoclonius

Monoclonius was a herbivore (plant-eater) ceratopsid dinosaur. It lived in North America during the Upper Cretaceous, about 76 to 73 million years ago.

"Monoclonius" was about 16 feet (5 meters) long, and probably weighed about 2 tons.

"Monoclonius" was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876, soon after the first fossil specimen (a near complete skeleton including skull material and the pbase of the nasal horn, with only the feet missing) had been founded in Montana. Its name means "single stem" and refers to its teeth, which have a single root.
