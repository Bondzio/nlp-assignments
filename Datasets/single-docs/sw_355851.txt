TransPennine Express

TransPennine Express is a British train operating company. It was formerly jointly owned by First Group (55%) and Keolis (45%). After April 2016, it is fully owned by First Group, which kept the franchise. It runs regular passenger trains in northern England, including trains linking the west and east coasts across the Pennines. TransPennine Express runs three routes which provide rail links for large cities like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, York and Newcastle. All three routes stop at Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport.
