South African Border War

The South African Border War usually refers to the conflict that took place from 1966 to 1990 in South-West Africa (now Namibia) and Angola between South Africa and its allied forces on the one side and the Angolan government, the South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) and their allied forces on the other.
The roots of the conflict can be traced back to World War I, when South Africa invaded and conquered the then German South-West Africa on behalf of the Allied Forces. In the aftermath of the war, the League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate to administer the territory. 
After World War II, South Africa refused to surrender its mandate for replacement by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration. Although the South African government wanted to incorporate South-West Africa into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de-facto "fifth province", with the white minority having representation in the (whites-only) Parliament of South Africa.
In the wake of the South Africa government's refusal and the implementation of its apartheid policies in South-West Africa (SWA), SWAPO became increasingly militant and in 1962 its military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), was formed.
In the mid-1960s, a number of SWAPO bases had been established in the neighbouring country of Zambia and its insurgents began infiltrating SWA. The first such incursion took place in September 1965 and the second in March 1966, but it was only on 26 August 1966 that the first major clash of the conlict took place, when a unit of the South African Police (SAP) - supported by South African Air Force helicopters - exchanged fire with SWAPO forces. This date is generally regarded as the start of what became known in South Africa as the "Border War".
