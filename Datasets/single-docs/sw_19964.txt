Het Wilhelmus

Wilhelmus is the title and first word of the Dutch national anthem. It became the anthem in 1932.
The melody is taken from a French soldier's song. It is the oldest melody of a national anthem of the world.
The song has 15 verses, and the first letters of each verse form the name "Willem van Nassov", the subject of the song.
