Dorothy

Dorothy is a female given name. It comes from the Greek Δωροθέα ("Dōrothéa") meaning "God's Gift", from δῶρον ("dōron"), "gift" + θεός ("theós"), "god". There are also male names in English such as "Dorie" from the Greek word "Δωρόθεος" ("Dōrótheos"). Also, the given names Theodore and Theodora come from the same two Greek words as Dorothy, but in the reverse order.
