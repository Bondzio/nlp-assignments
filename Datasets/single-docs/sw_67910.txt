Maid

A housemaid or, formerly, maidservant, or in current use maid is a female employed in domestic worker. Maids perform typical domestic chores such as cooking, ironing, washing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, caring for pets, and taking care of children like a nanny. In many places in some poor countries, maids often take on the role of a nurse in taking care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a uniform.

In June 2011, International Labour Organization has made its Convention No.189 for domestic workers including maids.
