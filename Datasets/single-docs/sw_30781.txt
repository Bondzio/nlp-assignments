Raven

A raven is a big black bird, ("Corvus corax"). It may be called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a crow but is a little different. The raven's feathers are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a distance. 

The most famous raven is in the Edgar Allen Poe story called "The Raven".

The common raven can be tamed. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and mysterious character.
