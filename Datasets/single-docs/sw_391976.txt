The National Institute of Statistics and Census of Costa Rica (Spanish: "Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos de Costa Rica", or "INEC") is the government institution in charge of censuses and official surveys in the country. The main office is located in San José.

INEC ran its first census in 1864, and the last one was the 10th population and the 6th dwellings census, held in June 2011.
