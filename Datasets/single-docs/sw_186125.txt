Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School

The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School (also known as PA Cyber) is an online school, made as an alternative to regular schooling. It recently changed its name from the Western Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School.

Students from Pennsylvania in grades Prekindergarten-12 can attend PA Cyber for free. Students can have classes that are self-paced and classes that are "virtual" where the student participates in a "online classroom".
