Goldwater was called "Mr. Conservative" during his political career. He was a Senator from Arizona. In 1960, he wrote "The Conscience of a Conservative". The book was a best seller. In 1964, he was the Republican candidate for President. He ran against Lyndon Johnson. Goldwater's most famous quote (which he said in July 1964 in San Francisco) was "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is no vice, and Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is no virtue." He meant that people should always do what was necessary to make the world freer and more just even if it was hard or made them unpopular. Goldwater lost to Johnson by a large number of votes.
