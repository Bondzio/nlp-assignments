It was directed by Glen Morgan and was produced by Marty Adelstein, Steve Hoban, Glen Morgan, Dawn Parouse, Victor Solnicki, and James Wong.

In December 2006, before the movie's premiere, it gained some criticism from religious groups because of its graphic content in a holiday setting, and the distributor's choice to release the movie on Christmas Day in the United States.

The movie gained negative reviews from critics and holds a 14% "rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times was quoted as saying "Like an ugly tie or a pair of slipper socks, Black Christmas is destined to be forgotten the instant it's unwrapped, gathering dust until the season rolls around again".
