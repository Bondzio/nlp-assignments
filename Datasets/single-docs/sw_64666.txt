Hijab

Hijab () is the Arabic word for "to cover", and in general, means to be modest. 

The word is used in particular to mean clothing which covers a woman's chest, head and hair. This is often done in Islam for females over the age of puberty. It is worn in the presence of adult males outside their immediate family. It may also be worn in front of adult non-Muslim female outside their immediate family . It is not necessary when females or males are within their immediate family. 

The Arabic word used to specifically mean this is "khimƒÅr" (). This "veil" can come in several different types, such as an ordinary veil (which only covers the head), and a niqab or burka, which covers the entire body. There are many styles to wear. Muslim men must also observe standards of modest dress. 

The Quran has no requirement that women cover their faces with a veil, or cover their bodies with the full-body burqa or chador.
