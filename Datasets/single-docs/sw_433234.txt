Evan Chandler

Evan Chandler (born Evan Robert Charmatz) (January 25, 1944 – November 5, 2009) was an American screenwriter and dentist. He is best known for accusing Michael Jackson of sexually abusing his son Jordan Chandler in 1993.

Chandler was born in the Bronx to Jewish parents. He changed his name from Charmatz to Chandler because he thought Charmatz was “too Jewish-sounding”.

Chandler wrote the 1993 movie "Robin Hood: Men in Tights". In her book "Shockaholic", Carrie Fisher said that Chandler was her dentist.

In 1993, Chandler accused Michael Jackson of molesting his son Jordan. Jordan had made the allegations after taking sodium amytal. The 1993 molestation case ended in 1994 after Jackson reached a settlement with Chandler for a reported U.S. $20 million.

An article in "USA Today" said that Chandler tried to sue Jackson again in 1996.
In 1996 Jordan took out a restraining order against Evan.

Chandler shot himself in the head on November 5 2009.
