Swatis

The Swatis () are a mixed origin tribe inhabiting the Hazara region in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA) of Pakistan. They are mostly found in the districts of Mansehra and Batagram, and to some extent in Kohistan as well. A number of Swatis are also settled in the Kashmir region.

The Swatis are the largest tribal group of land owners in Mansehra and Batagram districts. Most of the Swatis in Hazara speak Hindko but some also speak Pashto.

Their origins are mixed and not clear. They claim to have originated in the Shalman area of Afghanistan and migrated to the Swat valley in the early 13th century, around the time of Mohammad Ghori. The Swatis defeated the local Buddhists and Hindus of Swat District and established their own rule. The Swatis ruled in Swat for four centuries.

Later on, the Yusufzai tribe, who had recently migrated to Peshawar and Bajaur after their expulsion from Kabul by Governor Ulugh Beg Mirza in the 16th century, were welcomed by Swatis in the region. However, the Yusufzai pushed them out of Swat and took the area over themselves. Therefore, many Swatis crossed over into Hazara region and settled in their present homeland.

The Swatis are divided into three subtribes: Gebri, Mitrawi, and Mamaili, as well as a half-Swati group called Lughmani. 
Gebri are settle in Kaghan valley, Balakot, Garhi Habibullah, Mansehra, Dhodial, Shinkiari,Baffa, Batagram, Thakot and Konsh Valley. Mitrawi, and Mamaili are settled in Bherkund, Agror, Tikri Valley and Deshan of District Batagram.The Allai area is inhabited by all the three subtribes.The Lughmani are found in Baffa.
