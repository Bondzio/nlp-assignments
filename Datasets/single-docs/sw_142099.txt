Capparis decidua

Capparis decidua is commonly known as karir, kair, kirir, karril, etc. It is either a small tree with many branches or a shrub of the Thar desert and other hot and dry regions in southern Asia. It has a lot of thin, leafless branches, the small leaves being found only on young shoots. It rarely grows above a height of 5 meters (15 feet).
The berries can be eaten and mixed with sangri (beans from the tree Prosopis cineraria) form a vegetable dish called "Kair sangri" in Rajasthan, India, which is a delicacy to many.
