Hercules (1958 movie)

Hercules is a 1958 movie. It is based on the Ancient Greek tales of Hercules, Jason, the Argonauts, and the Golden Fleece. Steve Reeves stars as Hercules. A massive "saturation" promotional campaign was launched in the United States for the movie. It opened in 175 theaters alone in the New York City area. "Hercules" became a big hit as a result, and Steve Reeves became a big star. "Hercules" paved the way for dozens of flicks starring oily bodybuilders as mythological heroes battling monsters, despots, and evil queens. The movie had a sequel called "Hercules Unchained". It also starred Reeves.
