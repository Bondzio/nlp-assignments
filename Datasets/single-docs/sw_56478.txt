Ingrid Bergman

Ingrid Bergman (29 August 1915 – 29 August 1982) was a Swedish actress. 

Born in Stockholm, Ingrid Bergman enrolled at Royal Dramatic Drama School and began acting in movies in Sweden before being taken by producer David O. Selnick to Hollywood in 1939. Her first movie there was a remake of a Swedish movie she appeared in called "Intermezzo".

At the height of her fame and success, she scandalized the world, when she began an affair with Italian movie director Roberto Rossellini, while still married to her first husband Dr. Peter Lindström. She married Rossellini in 1950. 

She returned to Hollywood in 1956 with "Anastasia", which won her the Academy Award for best actress, followed by "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness" (1958). She went on appearing in movies in both America and Europe. Her last role was in a television miniserie on the life of Golda Meir (1982).
