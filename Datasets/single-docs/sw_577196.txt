Sarah Jiménez

Sarah Jiménez Vernis (February 3, 1927 – March 13, 2017) was a Mexican artist. She known for her political graphic work in the mid 20th century, especially with the Taller de Gráfica Popular. Her works would help her earn a membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. 

After her time with the Taller, her career shifted to teaching, and her work became mostly forgotten. However, there have been efforts to revive interest in it.

Jiménez was born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila in the north of Mexico. She moved to Mexico City in 1947. 

In 1954, she participated in the creation of a mural at the Escuela Belisario Dominguez, with her section dealing with the dead soldier of the Mexican Revolution. 

Jiménez died in Mexico City on March 13, 2017 from heart failure, aged 90.
