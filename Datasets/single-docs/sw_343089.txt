Brussels Airlines

Brussels Airlines is the main Belgian airline. It flies from Brussels Airport to destinations in Europe, Africa and North America. 

Brussels Airlines was created as the result of the merger of SN Brussels Airlines and Virgin Express in March 2006. SN Brussels Airlines had been created from Sabena, the former Belgian flag carrier, that had ceased operations on 7 November 2001. SN Brussels Airlines started its operations only five months later. Virgin Express was a low-cost airline, owned by the Virgin Group. In 2004, SN Airholding took over Virgin Express, and in 2006 it was announced that both companies would merge and fly under the "Brussels Airlines" brand. In 2008, the Lufthansa group bought 45% of Brussels Airlines' shares, and Brussels Airlines joined the Star Alliance.
