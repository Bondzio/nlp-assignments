Second Triumvirate

The Second Triumvirate was an alliance between Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus. It was formed to punish the conspirators who assassinated Julius Caesar. 

The Triumvirate lasted from 43 BC to 33 BC. It ended the effort by Marcus Tullius Cicero to reinstate the Senate as the sovereign body of the Republic. From then on Rome was ruled by an Emperor.
