90482 Orcus

90482 Orcus, originally known by the provisional designation 2004 DW) is a Kuiper belt object (KBO) and could be a dwarf planet. It was found by Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on February 17, 2004. It was also seen in pictures from November 8, 1951.

A moon of Orcus was found on 22 February 2007. The orbit of this moon has yet to be found out.

The satellite was found at 0.25 arcsec from Orcus with magnitude difference of 2.7.
Assuming an albedo similar to that of the primary, the magnitude suggests a diameter of about 220Â km. It is thought to be a smaller KBO that was captured.
