Cauchy distribution

The Cauchy-Lorentz distribution (after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Hendrik Lorentz) is a continuous probability distribution. As a probability distribution it is usually called a "Cauchy distribution". Physicists know it as a "Lorentz distribution". 

It is used in spectroscopy to describe the spectral lines found there, and to describe resonance.

The Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a "pathological" distribution. Both its mean and its variance are undefined.
