Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is a bishop in the Church of England and the present Bishop of Durham and also the confirmed nominee to succeed Rowan Williams as Archbishop of Canterbury.

Welby was born in London. His early career was in the oil industry but in 1989, he studied for ordination in Durham, England. After several parochial appointments he became the Dean of Liverpool and was appointed as the Bishop of Durham in 2011.

Welby's theology is reported as representing the evangelical tradition within Anglicanism and he has written about the relationship between finance and religion.
