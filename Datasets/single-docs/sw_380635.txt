Berthe Morisot

Berthe Morisot (14 January 1841 - 2 March 1895) was an Impressionist painter. She was born in Bourges, France, and died in Paris.

In the 1860s, she studied with Camille Corot. She exhibited at the 1865 Salon. Morisot met artist Édouard Manet in 1868. Manet painted her portrait several times. The two had great influence on one another's work. In 1874, she married his brother, Eugène.

She exhibited at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. Morisot worked in oils, pastels, and watercolor. Her pictures are light and delicate. They typically depict women and children in everyday domestic life.

Many critics ridiculed the Impressionists. Morisot was not spared. She was never commercially successful during her lifetime. During her lifetime however, she outsold prominent Impressionists Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley.
