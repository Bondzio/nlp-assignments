Judas (song)

Judas is a song by American pop singer Lady Gaga from her second studio album, "Born This Way". it was released as the second single from the album on April 15, 2011.

"Judas" is a house-tinged electropop and techno song about a woman falling in love with a man who betrayed her.

The song managed to reach the top ten in the US and Canada. On February 29, 2016, the song was certified double-Platinum by the RIAA for sales and shipments of over 2 million copies in the United States alone.

The music video for the song was controversial, like Gaga's video for "Alejandro", because it contained religious imagery. Gaga is shown dressed as Mary Magdalene in the video and depicted riding on the back of a motorcycle that an actor portraying Jesus is driving. The Catholic League condemned the video.
