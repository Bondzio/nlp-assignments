Hollister Co.

Hollister Co. is a clothing company owned by Abercrombie & Fitch. The kind of clothing they sell is "casual", meaning that it is for informal use. It also has a theme based on the surfing cultural movement of Southern California. The first Hollister store opened in July 2000 in Columbus, Ohio. Even though Hollister opened in 2000, many of their items say it was created in 1922. This is based on a story that is not real. On October 25, 2008 Hollister opened the first store outside the U.S. and Canada in Brent Cross, London.
