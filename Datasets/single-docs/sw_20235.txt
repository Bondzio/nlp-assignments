Methane

Methane is a hydrocarbon that is a gas at room temperature (20Â°C). Its molecular formula is CH, so it has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms per molecule. It is often found as the main part of natural gas. Methane is a greenhouse gas 23 times more effective than carbon dioxide. It is also less stable and slowly oxidates by oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. 

Methane is used in gas taps in places such as chemistry classrooms, laboratories, etc. as it burns very easily because of its simple molecular structure.

Methane's molecular structure is very simple. It is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms.

Methane can be produced by many chemical methods, but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by fractional distillation, after it is become liquid.
