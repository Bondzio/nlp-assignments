Montserrat Caballé

Montserrat Caballé (born 12 April 1933) is a Spanish (Catalan) operatic soprano and one of the greatest opera singers of the 20th century. Although she sang a wide variety of roles, she was particularly associated with the bel canto repertoire in which she was considered one of the finest modern exponents. She possessed a voice of great range and remarkable beauty combined with impeccable musicianship and a flawless technique.

Born in Barcelona, Spain, she studied at the Music Conservatory of her native city and graduated in 1954 with a gold medal. She began her professional career in Basel in 1956, as Mimi in "La bohème". She then joined the Bremen Opera, where she sang from 1959 to 1962, in a wide variety of roles.

International recognition came in 1965, when she appeared in a concert performance of Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia" at Carnegie Hall in New York City, as a replacement of an indisposed Marilyn Horne. The performance won her great acclaim from public and critics alike and made her an overnight sensation. Her success led to her debut that same year at the Metropolitan Opera, as Marguerite in Gounod's "Faust". 

She has since then been invited to sing at most of the major opera houses and festivals of the world. She was especially admired in works by composers such as Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi, and revived a number of long neglected works by these composers.
