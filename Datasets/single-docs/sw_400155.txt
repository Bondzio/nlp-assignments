British Mandate of Palestine

The British Mandate of Palestine was a mandate of the United Kingdom in Palestine and Jordan. It began after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. It started from 1 July 1920, and operated until 1948. Britain had defeated the Ottoman forces in 1917, and occupied the territory. The mandate was approved by the League of Nations in June 1922, and went into effect on 11 September 1922. 

The land west of the Jordan River, known as Palestine, was under direct British control until 1948. The land east of the Jordan River was known as Transjordan, and was governed by the Hashemite family. Transjordan gained independence in 1946. The mandate in Palestine ended at midnight on 14 May 1948. On the next day, the 1948 Arabâ€“Israeli War began. Israel declared independence, the West Bank was annexed by Jordan, and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip.
