Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome

Wiksott-Aldrich syndrome is an inherited immune disease that happens in young boys. It causes eczema (a type of skin inflammation), a smaller number of platelets (blood cells that help prevent bleeding), and frequent bacterial infections. People with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have a higher risk of developing leukemia and lymphoma.
