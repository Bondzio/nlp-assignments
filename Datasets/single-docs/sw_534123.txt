The reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The place is near the worker's village in Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings. Another consideration may be the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may be associated with rejuvenation for the dead.

The main wadi contains 91 tombs and nearby valleys add another 19 tombs.
