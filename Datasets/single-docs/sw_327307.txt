Se vuol ballare

The cavatina "Se vuol ballare" is an aria from "The Marriage of Figaro" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The lyrics are by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It portrays Figaro's intent to foil Count Almaviva's womanizing, but can also be read as a political attack on the power-wielding nobility of the time.
The song is sung in act 1. Figaro discovers Count Almaviva intends to exercise his feudal right to sleep with Figaro's wife Susanna before they consummate their marriage. Figaro sings of how he will unravel the Count's schemes and thwart him.

Beethoven wrote a series of 12 variations on the theme of "Se vuol ballare". It bears the Number WoO 40 (=Werk ohne Opuszahl, work without opus number)
