Hitachi Province

The province had borders with Iwashiro, Iwaki, Shimōsa, and Shimotsuke Provinces.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Ishioka.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Hitachi Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Kashima jinjū" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Hitachi.
