Division of Murray

The Division of Murray is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. 

It is located in the north of the state, next to the Murray River, which forms Victoria's border with New South Wales. It includes the towns of Shepparton, Echuca, Cobram, Yarrawonga, Boort and Bridgewater.

Murray was created in 1949. It was named after the Murray River, which itself was named after British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Sir George Murray. 

It was first held by Rt Hon Sir John McEwen, who was the caretaker Prime Minister of Australia after the disappearance of Harold Holt.
