Ottakring

Ottakring is part of Vienna. It is the 16th district of Vienna, created in 1893 from the villages of Ottakring and Neulerchenfeld. It is about 15 minutes away from the centre of Vienna by subway.
Today, there are less people in this district than in the past. In 1910, about 179,000 people lived there, but in 2006 there were only 94,000.

Josef Weinheber and Michael HÃ¤upl (the current mayor of Vienna) are some famous people from Ottakring.
