Alois Brunner

Alois Brunner (8 April 1912 â€“ c. 2010) was a Austrian Schutzstaffel (SS) officer. Brunner is wanted for war crimes, and was Adolf Eichmann's assistant. Eichmann referred to Brunner as his "best man". Brunner is wanted for sending at least 140,000 European Jews to the gas chambers. 

He was commander of the Drancy internment camp outside Paris from June 1943 to August 1944, from which nearly 24,000 people were deported. He was sentenced to death "in absentia" in France in 1954 for crimes against humanity. In 1961 and in 1980, Brunner lost an eye and the fingers of his left hand, as a result of letter bombs sent to him by the Israeli Mossad.

In 2003, the Guardian described him as "the world's highest-ranking Nazi fugitive believed still alive". Brunner was last reported to be living in Syria, whose government had long refused international efforts to locate or apprehend him.
