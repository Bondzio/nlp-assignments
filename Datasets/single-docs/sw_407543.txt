Grey was born on March 26, 1960 in New York City, New York to Joel Gray and to Jo Wilder. She studied at Dalton School. Grey has been married to Clark Gregg since 2001. They have one daughter, Stella.

In the early 1990s, Grey had two rhinoplasty procedures—the second of which was necessary to correct problems stemming from the first. Even even close friends to fail to recognize her, and the major change in her appearance hurt her career. Of the experience she said, "I went in the operating room a celebrity—and came out anonymous. It was like being in a witness protection program or being invisible." 

Grey briefly thought about changing her name and starting anew, but decided against this.

From March 1999 until January 2000, Grey starred as herself in the short-lived ABC sitcom "It's Like, You Know...", which used her much-publicized 'nose job' as a running gag.

In the 2010 season eleven of "Dancing With the Stars" she was partnered with professional dancer Derek Hough. They won the competition.
