The Wizard (film)

The Wizard is a 1989 American adventure comedy-drama family film directed by , written by David Chisholm, and starring Fred Savage, Christian Slater, , Beau Bridges, and .

The film is about three children travelling to California. The youngest of the three is a genius in video games. "The Wizard" is famous for its extensive product placement of video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The film was also famous for being North America's introduction to one of the best-selling video games of all time, "Super Mario Bros. 3".

After his little brother, Jimmy (), a boy who is always with his lunchbox, is put into a mental institution, Corey (Fred Savage) breaks him out and the pair run off together to California. On their way, Corey meets a girl named Haley () and discovers that Jimmy is a genius at playing video games. With talents like this, he could easily win the top prize of $50,000 at Video Armageddon. While the three travellers are going (hitch-hiking) to the competition, the boys' parents hire a bounty hunter to track them down.


Filming took place between June 5 and July 25, 1989. Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band was nearly cast in the lead role, but due to location conflicts (problems) was never officially offered the part. In a 2008 reunion and 2014 interview, Todd Holland, the director of the film, revealed that the original cut of the film was 2.5 hours long and included an extended backstory (background) for Corey and Jimmy.
