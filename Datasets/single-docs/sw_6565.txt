Henry the Navigator

Prince Henry the Navigator (1394â€“1460) was a prince from Portugal, the third son of King John I of Portugal. He was called Infante Dom Henrique in Portuguese. He was never a navigator himself. He got his name because he organized many ocean voyages on which lands were found. He is seen as the man who started the Age of Discovery. He is also known for opening a navigation school in Portugal, so tools and ships could be made better. Henry the Navigator also discovered the first shipping routes directly from Europe to Asia for the Portuguese monarchy.
