List of field guns

Field guns are one of two main types of field artillery. Field guns fire a heavy shell on a relatively level trajectory from a longer barrel. This gives very high muzzle velocity and good range performance. Field guns are best for giving long range fire support and counter-battery fire. This list has two categories; field guns that were moved (towed) by horses or vehicles, and guns that could move themselves (self propelled) guns.
