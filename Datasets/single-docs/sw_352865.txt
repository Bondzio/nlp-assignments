Hurricane Eloise

Hurricane Eloise was a really destructive storm in September 1975 that struck Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and northwest Florida. She caused around 80 deaths and $560 million along her path. When Eloise struck Florida, winds were 125Â mph, making the storm Category Three. The name Eloise was retired from Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone lists the following year.
