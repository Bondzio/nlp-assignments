Australopithecus afarensis

Australopithecus afarensis is an extinct hominid. It lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. "A. afarensis" was similar to slightly later "Australopithecus africanus". It had a slender build. 

"A. afarensis" may be more closely related to the genus "Homo" than "A. africanus". "Homo" includes the modern human species, "Homo sapiens".

The most famous fossil is the partial skeleton named Lucy (3.2 million years old) found by Donald Johanson and colleagues, who, in celebration of their find, repeatedly played the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".
