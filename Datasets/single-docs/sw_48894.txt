Inorganic compound

An inorganic compound is a chemical compound which is "not" an organic compound. That means it is not a carbon-based compound.

The division between the two types of compound is not absolute. Some carbon-containing compounds are traditionally considered inorganic. Many chemicals in nature are not compounds, but are ions. Sodium, chloride, and phosphate ions are essential for life, as are some inorganic molecules such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and oxygen. Aside from these simple ions and molecules, virtually all compounds covered by biochemistry contain carbon and can be considered organic or organometallic.

Major types of inorganic compounds include:
