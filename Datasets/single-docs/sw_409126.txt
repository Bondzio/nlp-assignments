It will continue to air on CBS until September 18, 2013. It is being called the "longest season to date" in "Big Brother" history, lasting a total of 90 days. This season features sixteen HouseGuests. 

The show's format remained the same from previous seasons of the show. A group of contestants, known as "HouseGuests", compete to win the series by voting each other off. They must be the last HouseGuest remaining. Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block. The Head of Household must nominate another HouseGuest as a replacement. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of them, the nominee with the most votes are removed from the show. When only two HouseGuests remain, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be "expelled" from the show for not following rules.

There have been several controversial remarks from some of the "Big Brother 15" HouseGuests. Their comments have angered viewers and because of this, the show's ratings have dropped. Many journalist have made negative reviews about the HouseGuests who made these remarks. HouseGuest including Aaryn Gries, GinaMarie Zimmerman and Spencer Clawson have made racist comments about two African American contestants on the show. Spencer made negative comments about a gay contestant calling him "Kermit the Fag". Aaryn and GinaMarie also made negative comments about Asian contestant Helen. Aaryn and GinaMarie were fired from their jobs because of their comments. However, they do not know about this because they are not allowed to be in contact with anyone outside of the "Big Brother" house.
