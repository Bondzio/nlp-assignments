Emperor Ninken

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

Ninken was a grandson of Emperor RichÅ«; and he was adopted by the childless Emperor Seinei.

Very little is known about the events of Ninken's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ninken. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Ninken is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
