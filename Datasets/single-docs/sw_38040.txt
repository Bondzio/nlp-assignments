Solomon

Solomon is a figure from Abrahamic religions. He was a King of Israel, the son of King David. His name means "Peace". He is written about in the Qur'an, the Bible (2 Samuel) and other scriptures. He is said to be the author of several Old Testament books. He wrote Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs and much of Proverbs. He is famous for building the First Temple, having lots of wisdom, being very rich, and having many wives. Because of his wives, though, his kingdom became divided right after his death. His wives worshipped idol gods. Furthermore they worship idol gods because many of them were not of Jewish lineage.
