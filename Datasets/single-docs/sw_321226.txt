Hyūga Province

Hyūga had borders with Bungo, Higo, Ōsumi, and Satsuma Province.

The ancient capital city of the province was near Saito.

In Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Hyūga is called in Tsukushi-no-shima, with Tsukushi, Toyo and Hi Province.

In 713 ("Wadō 6, 3rd month"), the province of Hyūga was separated from Ōsumi.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Hyūga Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Tsuno jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Hyūga.
