Pacific tree octopus

The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus is an internet hoax created in 1998 by Lyle Zapato. Lyle zapato is also not a real name. He has a website that tells this lie. You may see for yourself that this is a fairy tail that he has made up . His website has fooled my school so this is one reason people need to learn how to resarch in school It was said to be able to live on both land and water, unlike other octopi. It is absolute rubbish.

The original website that described the fake species is commonly used as an example in internet literacy classes to teach students to check more carefully if sources of information are reliable.

The text included other hoax species and organizations, mixed with links to pages about "real" species and organizations. Despite the falsehoods shown on the site, all 25 seventh-grade students involved in one well-publicized test believed the content. All but one of the 25 rated the site as "very credible".
