Bat-Sheva Dagan

Bat-Sheva Dagan () (born September 8, 1925) is a Polish-Israeli Holocaust survivor, educator, author, and speaker. She was born in Łódź, Poland.

She was incarcerated in a ghetto in Radom with her parents and two sisters in 1940. After her parents and a sister were deported and murdered in Treblinka in August 1942, she escaped to Germany, but was discovered, imprisoned, and deported to Auschwitz in May 1943. After spending 20 months in Auschwitz, she survived two death marches and was liberated by British troops in May 1945. She was the only survivor of her family. 

Dagan and her husband settled in Israel, where she taught kindergarten and later obtained degrees in educational counseling and psychology. She went on to author books, poems, and songs for children and young adults on Holocaust themes, and developed psychological and pedagogical methods for teaching the Holocaust to children. She is thought a pioneer in children's Holocaust education.

In 2008 Dagan was named Woman of the Year in Education by Yad Vashem for her works to Holocaust teaching for children. She was also named an Outstanding Member of the City of Holon. In 2012 she was honored as one of the torch lighters at ceremonies marking Yom HaShoah.
