Happy Days

Happy Days is an American TV show. It was originally aired on ABC between January 15, 1974 and June 12, 1984. It stars Ron Howard, and has several spin-offs. It is set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the 1950s and 1960s.

The term "jumping the shark", meaning when a good show goes bad, usually because of one or more major mistakes or running out of ideas, originated in a two-part episode of "Happy Days". The episode was about The Fonz jumping a shark. This is thought to be the moment where the show started going downhill.
