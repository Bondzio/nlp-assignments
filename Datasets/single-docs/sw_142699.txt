TNA X Division Championship

The TNA X Division Championship is a professional wrestling championship in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). The championship is defended by wrestlers in the X Division, meaning high flyers and cruiserweights. The championship debuted on June 19, 2002 at the taping of TNA's second weekly pay-per-view (PPV) event.

The current champion is Samoa Joe who is in his fifth reign. Joe defeated Low Ki and Seiya Sanada in a three-way match on June 27, 2014 in New York, NY during the "Impact Wrestling" tapings (airing August 7) to win the vacant title after the former champion Austin Aries intentionally forfeited the championship for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match.
