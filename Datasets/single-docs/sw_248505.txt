Pete Backor

Peter Backor (April 29, 1919 in Fort William, Ontario â€“ June 30, 1988) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played briefly for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL.

Although he played just a single season in the NHL, Backor made it count as he helped the Toronto Maple Leafs win the Stanley Cup in 1945. After that season he spent the next 11 years playing in the minor leagues for the Pittsburgh Hornets of the AHL with whom he won the Calder Cup in 1952, the Hollywood Wolves of the PCHL and the Sault Ste. Marie Indians of the NOHL. Backor retired from hockey in 1956.

He was one of the few players of Slovak descent in the NHL's younger years if not the first one ever.

He was brother-in-law to another NHL legend of Slovak descent Rudy Migay who played for Toronto Maple Leafs.
