Chemical energy

Many chemical reactions produce energy in the form of heat. This warmth is sometimes called chemical energy. Using Hess's law it is possible to calculate the amount of energy an exothermic reaction produces. Chemical energy should not be confused with binding energy. Binding energy is the work that is needed to split a system of many components into its parts.
