House of Bourbon

The House of Bourbon is an important royal house of Europe. Kings from the House of Bourbon ruled France from 1589 to 1792 and again from 1815 to 1848. This is a younger branch of the Capetian dynasty. Members of the House of Bourbon also ruled Naples, Sicily, and Parma in the past. Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and King Felipe VI of Spain are both part of the House of Bourbon.

All of these branches descended from three legitimate grandsons of Louis XIV.
