Polypeptide

A polypeptide is a string of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins. A single polypeptide chain might make up the entire primary structure of a simple protein; more complex proteins are formed when two or more polypeptides link together.

Polypeptides are made when mRNA is translated, a process involving ribosomes, tRNA and amino acids.
