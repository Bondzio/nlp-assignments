Propene

Propene is an organic compound.The substance is also known as propylene and has the formula CH. It is the second-simplest Alkene. Since it is only made of hydrogen and carbon atoms, it is a Hydrocarbon. At room temperature and normal pressure it is a gas. 

Propene is produced from fossil fuels, and from coal. Propene is the second most important product used in the petrochemical industry, after Ethene. About two thirds are used to produce Polypropylene. Propene and benzene are converted to acetone and phenol via the cumene process. Propene is also used to produce isopropanol (propan-2-ol), acrylonitrile, propylene oxide (epoxypropane) and epichlorohydrin.
