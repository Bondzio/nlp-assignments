List of Native American Medal of Honor recipients

This is a list of Native Americans presented the nation's highest military decoration â€” the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is bestowed "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force." The medal is presented by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress.

Of the 3,469 Medals of Honor presented as of 2012 only 28 have been given to Native Americans.

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient was killed (posthumously).
