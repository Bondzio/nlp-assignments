Constitutional Court of Romania

The Constitutional Court of Romania (CCR) is independent of any other public authority. It has, according to the Romanian Constitution, the "guardian of constitutional rule". This means the court has the power to make decisions, if the meaning of official laws is questioned (or "challenged"). This could happen if the laws are written so that they might harm the rights and freedoms of the Romanian people.
