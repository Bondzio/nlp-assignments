Cardinal tetra

The cardinal tetra ("Paracheirodon axelrodi") is a freshwater fish. 

Cardinal tetras grow to about 3 centimetres. They are shoaling fish and like to be kept with other cardinal tetras and they can be kept with other non-aggressive fish. In good conditions the cardinal tetra can live for about five years. The cardinal tetra is a very popular fish but is not as popular as the neon tetra because it is more difficult to breed. They like to live in a temperature of around 23–27°C.

The cardinal tetra will feed happily on flake foods and small pellets. They also eat live food such as bloodworms or brine shrimp. Wild ones will eat bugs.
