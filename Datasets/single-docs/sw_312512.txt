Fried chicken

Fried chicken consists of pieces of chicken that have been either battered or floured and then pan fried, pressure fried or deep fried. The breading adds a crisper crust to chickens' exterior. The chicken is cut at the joints with the bones and skin being left intact. Some fast food restaurant chains serve fried chicken, most notably Kentucky Fried Chicken and Church's Chicken.

Fried chicken is stereotypically associated with black people. There have been a number of public controversies about remarks that people have made about fried chicken and black people that have been considered racist.
