Linnean Society of London

The Linnean Society of London is the world's biggest society for the study and discussion of taxonomy and natural history. It publishes a Zoological Journal, as well as Botanical and Biological Journals. It also prints "The Linnean", a review of the history of the society and of taxonomy.

The Linnean Society was started in 1788. It was named after the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus. The Society is based at Burlington House in Piccadilly, London. Members can be a "Student member", an "Associate member" or a "full Fellow". To become a member, a person needs to be nominated by two or more Fellows, and succeed in an election. Fellows of the society can use the letters "FLS" after their names to show their membership of the Society (for example, "John Smith FLS").

The Linnean Society of London wants to promote the study of all areas of the biological sciences. They especially want to promote the study of evolution, taxonomy, biodiversity and sustainability. The Society awards medals and grants to help with this.

The following medals and prizes are awarded by the Linnean Society:

Linnaeus' botanical and zoological collections were bought in 1783 by Sir James Edward Smith, the first President of the society. They are held in London by the Society. The collections include 14,000 plants, 158 fish, 1,564 shells, 3,198 insects, 1,600 books and 3,000 letters and documents. If you want to see them, you need to make an appointment.
