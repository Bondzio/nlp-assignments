Nelson Mandela Square

Nelson Mandela Square is a shopping center in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was last known as Sandton Square. It was renamed Nelson Mandela Square on 31 March 2004 after a 6-metre statue of Nelson Mandela was added on the square. The statue was created to honor the former South African president.
