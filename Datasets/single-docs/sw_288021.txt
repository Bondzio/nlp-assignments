Hoja santa

Hoja santa (Piper auritum) is a good-smelling herb with a heart-shaped velvety leaf. The name "hoja santa" means "sacred leaf" in Spanish language. It is also known as yerba santa, hierba santa, Mexican pepperleaf, root beer plant, and sacred pepper.

The difficult taste of Hoja santa is not easy to describe. It has been compared to eucalyptus, licorice, sassafras, anise, nutmeg, mint, tarragon, and black pepper. The flavor is stronger in the young stems and veins.
