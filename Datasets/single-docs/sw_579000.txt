Gilbert Baker (June 2, 1951 â€“ March 31, 2017) was an openly gay American artist and civil rights activist. He designed the rainbow flag in 1978. Baker's flag became widely known with LGBT rights causes, a symbol of pride that became extremely used and well referenced in the decades since its debut.
