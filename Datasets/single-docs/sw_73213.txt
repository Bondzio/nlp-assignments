Kronosaurus

Kronosaurus was a large pliosaur, one of the largest.</small> It was one of the largest pliosaurs, and is named after the leader of the Greek Titans, Kronos. It lived in the Lower Cretaceous.

Body-length estimates, based on the 1959 Harvard reconstruction, had put the total length of "Kronosaurus" at 12.8 meters (42 feet). However, a recent study compared fossil specimens of "Kronosaurus" to other pliosaurs. The Harvard reconstruction may have included too many vertebrae, exaggerating its length. Its true length was probably only 9–10.5 meters (30–34 feet).
