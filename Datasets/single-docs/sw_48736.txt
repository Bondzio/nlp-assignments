List of U.S. states' largest cities

This is a list of the largest cities in each United States state and territory. State or territory capitals are listed in "italics".

Note 1: The only incorporated place in Hawaii is the City & County of Honolulu. A portion of it, the Honolulu District, is sometimes called the "city of Honolulu" for statistical reasons, although it has no government separate from that of the "City and County" as a whole. The U.S. Census Bureau defines Honolulu CDP (Census Designated Place) as the Honolulu District. For Hawaii, the largest CDPs are listed.

Note 2: As of June 2013, New Orleans remains at a population of 343,829 (according to the 2010 Census) still showing a long term decrease since Hurricane Katrina, which initially decreased the population of the city by about 50%. Many of the city's residents were displaced during the storm and it is still unknown how many will return or can be considered "displaced". Despite previous claims that with the 2010 Census New Orleans will move down in the rankings, it still remains the largest city in Louisiana by a margin of more than 100,000.
