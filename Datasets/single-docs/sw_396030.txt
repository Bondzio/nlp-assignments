The Cumberland Gap is a large natural break in the Appalachian Mountains. Historically, the gap was fertile hunting ground used by Native Americans. About 1775, it became the main route for settlers moving west into Kentucky. Between 1775 and 1810 as many as 300,000 settlers may have used the gap. Tours are led to the park's Hensley Settlement, an early 20th century Kentucky mountain community, and trips are made to Gap Cave which was once used for shelter by traveling Indians and settlers. Appalachian music festivals and concerts are held in the park.
