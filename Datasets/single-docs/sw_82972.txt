Japanese divinities

This is a list of divinities native to Japanese beliefs and religious traditions. Many of these are from Shinto, while others were imported via Buddhism or Taoism and "integrated" into Japanese mythology and folklore.

The following is a list of some of the major and minor deities in Shinto. As it is often said that there are "yaoyorozu-no-kami"(八百万の神) or 8 million kami (a representation of an infinite number), it would be impossible to list them all.
