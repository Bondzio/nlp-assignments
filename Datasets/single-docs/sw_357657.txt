IC 1101

IC 1101 is the largest known galaxy. It is a supergiant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. It is 1.07 billion light years away in the constellation of Serpens. 

The galaxy has a diameter of about 6 million light years, which makes it the largest known galaxy in terms of breadth. It is the central galaxy of a huge cluster which has a mass (mostly dark matter) of roughly 100 trillion stars. IC 1101 is more than 50 times the size of the Milky Way and 100 times as massive. If it were in place of our galaxy, it would swallow up the Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, Andromeda Galaxy, and Triangulum Galaxy. IC 1101 owes its size to many collisions of much smaller galaxies about the size of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.
