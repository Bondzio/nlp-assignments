Regolith

A regolith is a layer of loose material such as dust, soil, and broken rock which covers solid rock. The word is most often used when talking about the surface of planets and moons. The word "regolith" combines two Greek words: "rhegos, which means" "blanket", and "lithos" which means "rock".
