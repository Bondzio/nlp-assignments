Apostasy in Islam

Apostasy in Islam is when a follower of Islam tries to change their religion. When someone tries to reject their religion, this is called apostasy. There are different cases to be handled:

Most Sunni Islam and the Twelvers Shi'a Islamic schools of thought agree that apostasy is a sin. There is a difference between harmful apostasy and harmless apostasy (also known as major and minor apostasy). According to Wael Hallaq nothing of the apostasy law are based on the Qur'an, although the jurist al-Shafi'i interpreted the Qu'ranic verse 2:217. This provided the main evidence for apostasy being a capital crime in Islam. Sharia says the punishment for apostasy should be death, but the Qu'ran does not have a punishment for apostates in this world.

Some Islamic jurists argued or issued fatwas that either the changing of religion is not punishable or is only punishable under restricted circumstances Some groups within Islam, such as the Shi'a Ismaili, reject death for apostasy altogether.
