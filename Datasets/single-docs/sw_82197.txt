Goodbye (Eurovision song)

"Goodbye" was the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997.

The song was performed in Bosnian by Alma Čardžić.

The song is about the singer asking her lover not to end their relationship. She suggests many things that he could do, just as long as he does not "say the two words, which mean it's over" (the two words being "Goodbye, darling" – """" in Bosnian).
