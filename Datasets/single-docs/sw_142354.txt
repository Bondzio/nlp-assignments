Christopher Nolan

Christopher Jonathan James Nolan (born July 30, 1970) is a British-American movie director, writer and producer. He often works with his brother, author Jonathan Nolan. Nolan is best known for directing the psychological thriller "Memento", and for reviving the "Batman" movie franchise as the director of "The Dark Knight Trilogy". Each of them are "Batman Begins" (2005), "The Dark Knight" (2008), and "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012). He is also the founder of the production company, Syncopy Films. Nolan is color blind to the colors of green and red.

In July 2012, Nolan became the youngest director to be honored with a hand and footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.

In the months following the release of "The Prestige" (one of Nolan's other movies), Nolan made many comments suggesting that he would return to direct the sequel to "Batman Begins". In late July 2006, the sequel was officially confirmed as "The Dark Knight" with Nolan at the helm and Heath Ledger joining the cast as The Joker, Batman's nemesis. Nolan and his brother Jonathan wrote a script, based on a treatment written by himself and David S. Goyer. The movie began production in early 2007. It was released on July 18 2008 in the United States, to overwhelming critical acclaim. It has also made a lot of money, setting the record for the highest-grossing weekend opening in the U.S. with over $158 million.
