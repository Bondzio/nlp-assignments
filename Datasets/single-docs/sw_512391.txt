Ieng Thirith (née Khieu; ; 10 March 1932 – 22 August 2015) was an important Cambodian figure and political criminal in the Khmer Rouge, but was neither a member of the Khmer Rouge Standing Committee nor of the Central Committee. 

Thirith was the widow of Ieng Sary, who was minister of foreign affairs of Democratic Kampuchea's Khmer Rouge regime. She served as Minister of Social Affairs from October 1975 until the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. 

She was arrested by the Extraordinary Chamber in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in November 2007 with her husband, Ieng Sary, on suspicion of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. She was sentenced to house arrest. Her sentence was lifted in 2012 due to her health.

Thirith died from complications of Alzheimer's disease in Pailin at the age of 83.
