Royal Robbins

Royal Robbins (February 3, 1935 â€“ March 14, 2017) was one of the pioneers of American rock climbing. 

After learning to climb at Tahquitz he went on to make first ascents of many big wall routes in Yosemite. As an early proponent of boltless, pitonless clean climbing, he, along with Yvon Chouinard, was instrumental in changing the climbing culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s by encouraging the use and preservation of the natural features of the rock. 

He went on to become a well-known kayaker.

Robbins died on March 14, 2017 in Modesto, California from a long-illness, aged 82.
