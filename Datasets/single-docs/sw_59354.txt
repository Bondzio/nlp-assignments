Nicholas II of Russia

Nicholas II of Russia, (May 18, 1868 â€“ July 17, 1918) was the last Tsar or Emperor of the Russian Empire. He became Tsar in 1894 after his father, Tsar Alexander III died. He married Princess Alix of Hesse, who was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and they had five children, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Alexi. Alexi suffered from a disease called haemophilia, which caused his parents great sadness. 

World War I created many problems for Russia and the Tsar. In the 1917 Russian Revolution he abdicated (gave up being Tsar) in March of that year. He and his family were held as prisoners under house arrest. On July 17, 1918, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were killed by a firing squad. In 1981, the Tsar and his family were made Saints by the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1990, the bones of the Tsar and his family were found in the woods and given a proper burial in 1998.
