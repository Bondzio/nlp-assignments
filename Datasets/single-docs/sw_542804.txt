Old Prussian language

Old Prussian is an extinct Baltic language. It was spoken by the indigenous peoples of Prussia, the Old Prussians. It was spoken in the area where north-eastern Poland and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia are today. It went extinct in the early 18th century. There has been an attempted revival, but with little progress.
