The University of Detroit Mercy is a private, Roman Catholic co-educational university in Detroit, Michigan. The university has about 5,450 students.

The current president of the university is Antoine M. Garibaldi. 

The university calls itself simply "Detroit" for sports purposes, and its teams are nicknamed Titans. They have 17 varsity teams and they compete in the Horizon League.
