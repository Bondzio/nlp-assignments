Extreme Championship Wrestling

Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) was a professional wrestling company that ran from April 25, 1992 to April 4, 2001. The company was known for its hardcore style of wrestling as well as lucha libre to puroresu.

The company was originally known as Eastern Championship Wrestling and was owned by Tod Gordon. It was then renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling and Paul Heyman was brought in as the new owner after Tod Gordon sold ECW to him in 1995. World Wrestling Federation purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling after Heyman filed for bankruptcy on April 4, 2001.

WWE hosted a pay-per-view called ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005 which featured ECW alumni. They hosted another ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006 which helped introduce the relaunch of the ECW franchise as a WWE brand like Raw and SmackDown. Paul Heyman was also brought back to be the newly appointed figurehead for the ECW brand and recommissioned the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to be the brand's world title. He awarded it to Rob Van Dam after Van Dam won the WWE Championship at the 2006 One Night Stand. The brand operated until February 16, 2010.
