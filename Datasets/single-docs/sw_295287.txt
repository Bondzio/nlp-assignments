Nature Coast

The Nature Coast is a region of the U.S. state of Florida. It is made up of the Big Bend (Florida) area of the western coast and includes Citrus, Dixie, Hernando, Jefferson County, Pasco County, Levy County, Taylor County, and Wakulla County counties.

Pasco County is sometimes considered part of the Sun Coast.

The history of the name "The Nature Coast" goes back to 1991 as part of a marketing campaign to attract vacationing people to the nine county area, the name "Nature Coast" caught on quickly and describes the area previously known as the "Big Bend" of Florida.
