Cucumber

The cucumber ("Cucumis sativus") is a widely grown plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. This family also includes squash. A cucumber looks similar to a zucchini (British English: courgette). 

To a botanist, cucumbers are fruits: that is their biological function. To people they are vegetables: that is their value as a food. They can be cooked, eaten raw, or pickled.
