Differential (mechanical device)

A differential is a mechanical device made up of several gears. It is used in almost all mechanized four-wheel vehicles. It is used to transmit the power from the driveshaft to the drive wheels. Its main function is to allow the drive wheels to turn at different rpms allowing the wheels to go around corners while still receiving power from the engine.
