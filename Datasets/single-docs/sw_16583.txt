Aardvark

The Aardvark ("Orycteropus afer") is a mammal from Africa; its name means "earth pig" in the language Afrikaans. It is the only living member in its order, though some fossil genera have been found


The Aardvark looks a bit like the South American anteaters but they are not related. It is in a proposed clade Afroinsectiphilia, with the golden moles and tenrecs. Another proposal is to out it in the Pseudungulata, with the elephants and Sirenia. There is no consensus at present.

Adult aardvarks weighs about 60 kilograms (130 pounds) and a little more than one meter (45 inches) long.

Aardvarks eat mostly ants and termites. They have a long sticky tongue which makes it easy to pick up many ants at once.

Aardvarks are nocturnal, which means they are awake at night and asleep during the day.
