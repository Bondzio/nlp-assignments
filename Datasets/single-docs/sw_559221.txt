Domain name registrar

A company designed to provide domain registration service to other companies or individuals that would like to own a particular web address. The party seeking to register the site will usually pay the domain name registrar a flat or monthly fee to keep the name registered, so that no other person is able to acquire the web address. The systems setup by the domain name registrar translates IP addresses into easily identifiable domain names.
