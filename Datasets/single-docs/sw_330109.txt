Les contes d'Hoffmann

Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The Tales of Hoffmann") is a French opera. It has a prologue, three acts and an epilogue. The music was written by Jacques Offenbach. The libretto was written by Jules Berbier and Michel Carr√©. It is based on E.T.A Hoffmann's "Dr Sandmann, Geschichte von Verloreren Spiegelbilde". The opera was first performed in Paris, on 10 February 1881. 

The opera was the last and perhaps greatest work of Offenbach. It was not quite finished when he died. The final score was completed by Ernest Guiraud. Guiraud also wrote the recitatives, though at first it was meant to have spoken-dialogue. The work was an immediate success and has remained so since its creation.
