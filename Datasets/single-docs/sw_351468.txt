Enthroned

Enthroned is a black metal band formed in Charleroi in 1993 by Cernunnos. 

In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began a large tour of Europe. 

In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording "Towards the Skullthrone of Satan", Cernunnos took his life. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos.

In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral. They also released the MCD "Regie Axese", which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. 

Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. 

In early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records. In 2003 they played a South American tour. Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. 

In September 2011, Enthroned said they would end working with Regain Records.
