John Seigenthaler

John Lawrence Seigenthaler (; July 27, 1927 â€“ July 11, 2014) was an American journalist, writer, and political figure. He was known as an avid supporter of First Amendment rights.

Seigenthaler joined the Nashville newspaper "The Tennessean" in 1949. He resigned in 1960 to be Robert F. Kennedy's administrative assistant. He rejoined "The Tennessean" as editor in 1962. He became publisher in 1973. He became chairman in 1982. He retired as chairman emeritus in 1991. Seigenthaler was also founding editorial director of "USA Today" from 1982 to 1991.

In May 2005, a Wikipedia user created a five-sentence article about Seigenthaler that had false information such as Seigenthaler being called a suspect in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.

In April 2014, the Shelby Street Bridge was renamed the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in his honor. While reporting for "The Tennessean" in the 1950s, Seigenthaler once prevented a suicidal man from jumping off the bridge.

Seigenthaler died of complications from colon cancer on July 11, 2014, at the age of 86. He was surrounded by his family in his home.
