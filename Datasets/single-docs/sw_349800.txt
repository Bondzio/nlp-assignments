Immaculate Antbird

The Immaculate Antbird ("Myrmeciza immaculata") is a species of antbird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in forests in Costa Rica, Panama, western and northern Colombia, western Venezuela, and western Ecuador. The species eats insects, and usually follows swarms of army ants to catch prey. However, it may sometimes find its prey away from the swarms.
