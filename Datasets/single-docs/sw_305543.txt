Delirium tremens

Delirium tremens (often called DTs or the DTs) is a medical emergency. It is the worst form of alcohol withdrawal, which can happen when a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking. "Delirium" means very bad confusion that comes on quickly; "tremens" means "shaking."

Scientists think the DTs happen because the autonomic nervous system gets too excited. It works too hard and will not shut off.

DTs were first described in 1813.

Most people who stop drinking alcohol do not get the DTs. But some people are more likely to get the DTs if they suddenly stop drinking. DTs are more likely in people who:

About 5% of people who have alcohol withdrawal symptoms get the DTs. About 5-10% of chronic (long-term) alcoholics get the DTs at some point in their life.

DTs cause symptoms that can be very bad and very dangerous. Even though not many people get DTs when they stop drinking, many people that do get DTs die from them. Others get permanent brain damage or other problems.

Symptoms usually start within 2 to 3 days after the person had their last drink. But in some people, DTs can happen up to a week or 10 days after their last drink.

Most people who die from DTs die from one or more of these symptoms:

Other body symptoms caused by DTs include:

DTs can cause changes to thinking and feelings that can be very scary for the patient:

DTs can cause major changes to the senses, especially what a person sees, hears, and feels. For example:

DTs always need to be treated in a hospital. If a person starts having symptoms of DTs at home, 9-1-1 (or their local emergency number) should be called for an ambulance right away.

Several types of medicines can be used to treat DTs:
People with DTs are also often given thiamine (vitamin B1), an important vitamin, because alcoholics often do not have enough thiamine. If thiamine levels are low enough, this can cause brain damage.
