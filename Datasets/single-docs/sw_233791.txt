A-flat minor

A-flat minor is a minor scale starting on A. Its key signature has seven flats.

Its relative major is C-flat major, and its parallel major is A-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is G-sharp minor.

A-flat minor is rarely used as the main key of a piece of music. 
More often, pieces in a minor mode that have A as the tonic are written in the enharmonic key, G-sharp minor, because it has a simpler key signature. Because of this, there are few works in A-flat minor.

In some scores, the A minor key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top.


A-flat minor is also used in Frederick Loewe's score to the 1956 musical play "My Fair Lady"; the Second Servants' Chorus is set in A-flat minor.

Another example of popular music in A-flat minor is Walkin' on the Sun by Smash Mouth.
