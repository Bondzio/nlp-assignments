June 2017 London attack

On 3 June 2017, starting at 21:58 British Summer Time (UTC+1), three people carried out a terrorist attack in two locations in central London. The attack began when a white van rammed pedestrians on London Bridge. The van drove on and stopped south of the bridge. Three men left the van and ran to Borough Market, where stabbing attacks took place in restaurants. One witness reported that the attackers shouted "This is for Allah" and stabbed customers with knives.

Ten people (including three attackers) were killed and 48 injured in the attack. Three suspects wearing fake explosive vests were shot dead by police. 

The Metropolitan Police declared the London Bridge and Borough Market attacks to be "terrorist incidents".

On 4 June, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd said, "We are confident about the fact that they were radical Islamic terrorists, the way they were inspired, and we need to find out more about where this radicalisation came from." On 5 June, two of the attackers were identified as Khuram Shazad Butt and Rachid Redouane. The third of the three attackers, Youssef Zaghba was identified the following day.
