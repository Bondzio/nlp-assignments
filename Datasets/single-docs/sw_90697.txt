Greek War of Independence

The Greek War of Independence (1821â€“1829), also commonly known as the Greek Revolution, was a successful war by the Greeks who won independence for Greece from the Ottoman Empire. Muhammad Ali Pasha was one of the Muslim rulers who fought the Greeks. After a long and bloody struggle, and with the aid of the United Kingdom, France and Russia, independence was finally achieved, and confirmed by the Treaty of Constantinople in July 1832. The Greeks were thus the first of the Ottoman Empire's subject peoples to be accepted as constituted an independent sovereign power.
