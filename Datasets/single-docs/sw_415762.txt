Most distant things

This article lists the most distant things known to us, all of which are galaxies or energy sources inside galaxies. Their distances are described in two ways. redshift = z, and billion light years (Gly).

As of 2012, there are only about 50 possible objects z=8 or farther, and another 100 z=7 candidates. Candidates vary in their notablity, so not everything is included here. 1 Gly = 1 billion light-years = 10 ly.
