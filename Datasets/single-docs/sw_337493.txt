Chilean Gendarmerie

The Chilean Gendarmerie, (, abbreviated to "GENCHI") is the title of Chile's uniformed national prison service. The service evolved out of Chilean Army units which were given police and prison duties. It is an armed service responsible to the Ministry of Justice. In the actuality, the service is currently led by the General Director of the Gendarmerie Mr. Luis Masferrer Far√≠as, a lawyer appointed to this role by the Chilean president in 2010.
