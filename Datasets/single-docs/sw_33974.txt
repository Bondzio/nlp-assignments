Diaspora

Diaspora (, literally, "a scattering or sowing of seeds") is used (without capitals) to refer to any people or racial group living outside their traditional homelands, emigrating and being scattered in distant places and making a new community. It was first used capitalized to mean the scattering of Jews after the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BC.
