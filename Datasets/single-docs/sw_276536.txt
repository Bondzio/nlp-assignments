Rock Lee

Rock Lee is a character from the anime and manga series Naruto. As a child, he was always looked down upon and made fun of because he was never able to use either ninjutsu or genjutsu. 

His fierce determination to reach the true pinnacles of his strength was admired by a man named Might Guy, who eventually showed him the way. He bears a striking resemblance to his sensei Guy, with fuzzy eyebrows and shiny black hair.
