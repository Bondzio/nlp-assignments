Al-Shabaab (militant group)

al-Shabaab is a militant group based in Somalia. It seeks to eliminate Sufism from Somalia and has opposed various Sufi groups. It was recognised as a cell of al-Qaeda in 2012. The official name of the group is Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen ().

Some people who were in the Islamic Courts Union formed al-Shabaab in 2006 or 2007. Wahhabi ideas inflenced al-Shabaab. Al-Sagabaab wants to create an Islamic state at the Horn of Africa, and to take part in a golbal djihad.

Al-Shabaab controls large parts of southern Somalia. In the area it controls, there is a strict form of Sharia law. The group has claimed responsibility for various terrorist attacks.
