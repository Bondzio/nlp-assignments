End of the Lunch

End of the Lunch is an oil painting by Pierre Auguste Renoir. It was painted in 1879. François Mathey writes, "This picture, redolent with a warm, healthy, and vibrant sensuality was painted under the arbor of Oliver's restaurant in Montmartre." The sitters are Ellen Andrée, the artist's current model Marguerite, and the son of a shipowner.
