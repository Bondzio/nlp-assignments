Ring (mathematics)

In mathematics, a ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (•). These two operations must follow special rules to work together in a ring. 

Mathematicians use the word "ring" this way because a mathematician named David Hilbert used the German word "Zahlring" to describe something he was writing about. The integers, the rational numbers, the real numbers and the complex numbers are all famous examples of rings. There are other, more unusual examples of rings, however they all obey the special rules below.

The operations are used to combine two elements to form a third element. There are a few rules the set and the operations must obey to qualify as a ring. These are called ring axioms:


Some rings have additional properties from those mentioned above, these rings get special names:

Commutative Ring
If "x" • "y" = "y" • "x" holds for every "x" and "y" in the ring, then the ring is called a "commutative ring".

Ring with Unity
If there is a multiplicative identity element, that is an element e such that for all elements a in R, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds, then the ring is called a ring with unity. This element is usually written as 1.

Division Ring
If every element of the ring has a multiplicative inverse, that is for each a in R, there exists an element a in R such that a • a = 1, where 1 is the multiplicative identity element, then the ring is called a division ring.

Integral Domain
In a ring, it may be possible to multiply two things which are not zero and get zero as a result. If this is impossible in a certain ring, then the ring is called an "integral domain".

Field
A ring with all of the above properties is called a field.
