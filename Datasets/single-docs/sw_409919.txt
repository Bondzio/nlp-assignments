WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!

WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!, released in Japan as Made in Wario and in European regions as WarioWare, Inc.: Minigame Mania, is an action video game for the Game Boy Advance. It was developed and published by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on March 21, 2003, in Europe on May 23, 2003, and in North America on May 26, 2003. It is the first game in the "WarioWare" series.

In this game, players play "microgames", small minigames that last for only a few seconds. In these games, the player has to figure out what to do to complete them. They are helped by a word or phrase that appears at the beginning of the game. Games can be things such as shooting targets, selecting a multiple choice answer, or surviving until the end. Players are given four lives. If the player runs out of lives, the game ends.

A remake, "WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$!", was released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2003.
