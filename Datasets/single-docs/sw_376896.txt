List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: Q–S

The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government. It is bestowed on members of the United States armed forces. To receive it they must distinguish themselves "…conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States…". Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented after the person was killed (posthumously).

Many of the medals presented during the American Civil War were for capturing or saving regimental flags. During the Civil War these flags served as the rallying point for the unit. They also guided the unit's movements. Loss of the flag could greatly disrupt a unit. It could have a greater effect than the death of the commanding officer.
