Marie Claire

Marie Claire is a major monthly magazine for women. It was first published in France, although it later expanded into other countries. The edition in the United States focuses mostly on women. "Marie Claire", however, also covers health, fashion and beauty topics. The magazine was started in 1937 by Jean Prouvost and Marcelle Auclair.
