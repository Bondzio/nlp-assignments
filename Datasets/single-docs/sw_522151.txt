After Eamon had released his debut single "Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)", a female R&B singer from Staten Island called Frankee released her debut single which was an answer back to "Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)". She claimed that they were in a relationship. Eamon claimed in an interview that they were not in relationship and that he didn't know who she was. He was only involved with her song because it sampled his. Eamon was asked for the licensing permission which made him one of her song's songwriters.
