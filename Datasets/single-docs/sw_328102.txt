CTV Television Network

CTV Television Network (commonly referred to as CTV) is a Canadian English language television network.




Since the 2007 acquisition of A-Channel by CTVglobemedia as part of the takeover of CHUM Limited, media analysts had speculated that CTV may potentially extend its market-leading CTV brand to that network. It was first rebranded as "A" in 2008, then as "CTV Two" on August 29, 2011.
