Planck length

The Planck length is a very small unit of length. It is calculated from three physical constants: the speed of light, the Planck constant, and the gravitational constant. 

It is about 1.6 x 10 m or about 10 times the size of a proton. It is one of the Planck units, defined by Max Planck. It is an important length for quantum gravity because it may be the size of the smallest black holes.
