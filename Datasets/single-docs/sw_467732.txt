Battle of Crete

The Battle of Crete was a battle fought in World War 2 between the Nazis and British soldiers with Greek support. It was fought from 20 May to 1 June 1941. The battle began in the morning of 20 May when German paratroopers, began Operation Mercury. The battle was fought on the Greek island of Crete.

On the first day of fighting, the German paratroopers suffered heavy losses due to large amounts of Anti-Air guns, and Allied soldiers, but the British were confident that they would destroy the German invasion. But due to miscommunication and bad decisions, the Germans were able to capture Maleme airfield on West Crete, allowing them to transport supplies and reinforcements to Crete, and destroy the Allied forces defending the island.

This battle was the first time Hitler used paratroopers on a massive scale, Also being the first massive airborne invasion on Military history, and the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from the German Enigma code, also the first time when German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population. That was common later in the war.
