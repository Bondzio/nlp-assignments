National Assembly for Wales

The National Assembly for Wales () is a devolved assembly with the power to make laws in Wales. It is also called "the Welsh Assembly".

The Assembly was created after the "Government of Wales Act 1998" law, which was introduced after a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to make "primary legislation" until the "Government of Wales Act 2006" law, which gave the Assembly limited powers to make laws.

Its powers were increased again after a Yes vote in a referendum on 3 March 2011, which allowed the Assembly to make laws without having to ask the UK parliament, or the Secretary of State for Wales.

The Assembly has 60 members, called Assembly Members, or AMs for short. In Welsh, they are called "Aelod y Cynulliad".

Assembly Members are elected for 4 years in an "additional members system - "40 AMs are elected by the "plurality system, "and represent the different areas of Wales. Another 20 AMs from 5 electoral regions are also elected, by the "proportional representation system."
