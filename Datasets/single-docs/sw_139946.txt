Overseas France

Overseas France () is the part of France that is outside of the European continent. It consists of all overseas departments, territories and collectivities. These territories have several different legal statuses and levels of autonomy. Overseas France includes island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, French Guiana in South America, and Adélie Land in Antarctica. Each inhabited territory is represented in both the French National Assembly and the French Senate (which together make up the Parliament of France).

2,685,705 people lived in the overseas departments and territories in January 2011.

Overseas departments and regions are completely part of France.

The category of "overseas collectivity" was created by changes made to France's constitution in 28 March 2003. Each overseas collectivity has its own written laws.




The overseas departments and territories are represented by 27 "députés" in the French National Assembly and 21 senators in the French Senate. This is 4.7% of the 577 "députés" and 6% of the 343 senators.
