WWE NXT

WWE NXT, formerly known as NXT Wrestling, is a professional wrestling promotion based in Winter Park, Florida. It is the official developmental territory for WWE (legal name World Wrestling Entertainment).

The promotion, in its current form, was started by Steve Keirn in 2007 to be WWE's second developmental territory when they ended their relationship with the Georgia-based Deep South Wrestling in early 2007. It became their only developmental territory in early 2008 when they ended affiliation with Ohio Valley Wrestling.

FCW's first show was on June 26 2007 at Tampa, Florida's Dallas Bull. A 21 man Battle Royal was held during the show, with Harry Smith booked to win and become the first ever FCW Southern Heavyweight Champion. The next year the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship was introduced, with Jake Hager becoming the first champion at a February 15 show after surviving a Battle Royal and defeating Ted DiBiase, Jr.. The FCW Florida Tag Team Championship was also introduced in February, with the Puerto Rican Nightmares (Eddie Col√≥n and Eric Perez) beating Steven Lewington and Heath Miller to win it in the finals of a one night tournament. The singles titles were later unified, keeping the "Florida Heavyweight" name.

In August 2012, WWE dropped the FCW name, retired all FCW championship belts, and began running its developmental efforts under the "NXT" name. WWE had previously used NXT for a reality television program that featured FCW wrestlers trying to earn a WWE contract. "WWE NXT", which had been the name of the reality show, is now used as the title of NXT Wrestling's main TV program.

FCW regularly ran shows every Tuesday at Bourbon Street nightclub, as well as spot shows on other nights at other venues in and around the Central Florida area. They are also in the getting ready to start a weekly television series when get a public restroom built in. As NXT Wrestling, it now runs live shows ar several locations around Florida.
