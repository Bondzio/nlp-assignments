Dunkin' Donuts

Dunkin' Donuts is an American franchise based from the Detroit metropolitan area. The company sells doughnuts and coffee, although they are closer in similarity to Starbucks instead of traditional doughnut selling companies (in particular Krispy Kreme). The franchise was established around 1950, and as of 2010, over ten thousand Dunkin' Donuts locations exist. Recently they set up many stores in the UK.
