New Super Mario Bros.

New Super Mario Bros. is a platformer video game made and sold by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS game console. It is the first "Mario" platform game in 2D on a handheld console since "" in 1992. It was first sold in stores in North America on May 15, 2006, and was later sold in stores in Japan on May 25, 2006, in Australia on June 8, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006. A sequel, New Super Mario Bros. Wii for Nintendo Wii, was released in November and December 2009.

Mario and Princess Peach are out for a walk when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach. Mario must go through eight worlds to save her.

The game uses many old features from older Mario games. The countdown game clock is back; if Mario does not reach the castle at the end, he will lose a life. Mario also must jump and catch onto a flagpole at the end of the level and goes into a castle, just like he did in "Super Mario Bros.". Before and after a level, Mario is on a world map, which was last used in "Super Mario World".

Mario also has new powers from the 3D games ("Super Mario 64" and "Sunshine"). He can do a ground pound and can do a triple jump in the air. Both of these things first started in the 3D games.
