Common year starting on Wednesday

This is the calendar for any common year starting on Wednesday, January 1 (dominical letter E). The most recent year of this type was 2014 and the next one will be 2025 in the Gregorian calendar,
or 2015 and 2026 in the Julian calendar. The exceptional common year, 1800 was also a common year starting on Wednesday in the Gregorian calendar (see bottom tables).

A common year is a year with 365 days--in other words, not a leap year, which has 366.
