Fedora

A fedora is a hat. The name of the hat comes from a play called Victorien Sardou, FÃ©dora. Popular in the early 20th century, it has become a stereotype for gangsters or Private Investigators (PIs).

They mainly come in black, sometimes with a band of coloured fabric around the rim.

Some people, such as Jack Abramoff and Richard W. Lariviere, become known for wearing fedoras.
