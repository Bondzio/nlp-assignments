Resin

Resin is a hydrocarbon secreted by many plants, especially coniferous trees.

Plants evolved many complex chemicals as defences against herbivores. That may be the origin of these resins, which are certainly not good to eat. 

Humans value them for their chemical constituents and uses. They are used in varnishes, adhesives, as raw materials for organic synthesis, or for incense and perfume. Fossilized resins are the source of amber. The term is also used for synthetic substances with similar properties.

Rosin, (also called 'colophony' or 'Greek pitch') is a solid form of resin. It is got from pines and some other plants, mostly conifers. Heating fresh liquid resin vaporizes light volatiles like terpenes. 

Rosin is semi-transparent and yellow to black in colour. The term "colophony" comes from "colophonia resina" or "resin from the pine trees of Colophon", an ancient Ionic city.

Rosin has hundreds of uses, of which only a few can be mentioned here. These uses fall into groups, such as:
