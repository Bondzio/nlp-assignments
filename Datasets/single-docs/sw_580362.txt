Marion Jones

Marian Jones (Born 12 Oct 1975) is a widely known woman athlete. Her contribution for women across the ages was that she was the first women to win five track and field medals at a single Olympics. Many say that Marion Jones changed the world. What Jones did to affect future generations was prove that women can do anything, to prove that women don't have to fall under a stereotype because of the gender someone is assigned in birth. Many suspected Marion Jones accomplished so much because she was on steroids. Jones denied the allegations. In 2007, Jones admitted that she used steroids. The International Olympic Committee took away her five medals and sentenced her to six months in prison. People described Jones as a liar, and she was, but she admitted to her lies.
