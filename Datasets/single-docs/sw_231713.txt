Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays

Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays or PFLAG is an American organization. It is devoted to the cause of homosexual or gay rights while actively involving (as in its' name) parents, family and friends of those individuals. The organization started in 1972 when Jeanne Manford watched in horror as the police of New York City ignored her son being thrown down an escalator, during a protest for gay rights.
