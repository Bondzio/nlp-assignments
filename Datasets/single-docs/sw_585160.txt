Tommy Lasorda

Thomas Charles Lasorda (born September 22, 1927) is a former Major League Baseball player. He has had a lengthy career in sports management. 

In 2009, he marked his sixth decade in one capacity or another with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers organization, the longest discontinuous (he played one season with the Kansas City Athletics) tenure anyone has had with the team, edging Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully by two seasons. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 1997.

Lasorda came out of retirement to manage the United States team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He led the Americans to the gold medal, beating heavily favored Cuba, which had won the gold medals at the two previous Olympics.
