Halal

Halal (حلال, halāl, halaal) is an Islamic Arabic term meaning "permissible". It has both a general and specific meaning. 

When people use the word in Islamic countries, they usually mean to say "what is allowed by Islamic Law". In non-Islamic countries, the word usually means "fit to be eaten by a Muslim". 

Muslims have strict rules of what they can and cannot eat:

A similar concept is the Jewish Kosher (or "Kashrut").
