Electronic filters are electrical circuits which perform signal processing functions, specifically to remove unwanted frequency components from the signal, to enhance wanted ones, or both. Electronic filters can be:


The most common types of electronic filters are linear filters, regardless of other aspects of their design. Digital filters use a Fourier transform.
