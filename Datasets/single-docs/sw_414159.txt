Mehmed VI

Mehmet VI (14 January 1861 – 16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. His reign lasted from 1918 to 1922. He succeeded his brother, Mehmed V, as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of the heir to the throne, Yusuf Izzettin Efendi. He was presented with the Sword of Osman on 4 June 1918 in the traditional coronation ceremony. His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü (1831 – May 1861). Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922.
