Buzen Province

Buzen had borders with Bungo and Chikuzen Provinces.
The ancient capital city of the province was near Toyotsu, Fukuoka. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Buzen Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Usa-jinjÅ«" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Buzen.
