Mulhacén

Mulhacén is the highest mountain in continental Spain and in the Iberian Peninsula. It is part of the Sierra Nevada range in the Cordillera Penibética. It is named after Abu l-Hasan Ali, or "Muley Hacén" as he is known in Spanish, the last-but-one Muslim King of Granada in the 15th century, who according to legend was buried on the summit of the mountain.
