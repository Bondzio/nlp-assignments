Dave Dryden

David Murray "Sod" Dryden (born September 5, 1941 in Hamilton, Ontario) is a Canadian retired ice hockey goaltender. Dryden was known for the distinction of creating (as well as being the first goaltender to employ) the modern day goaltending mask consisting of a fiberglass mask with a cage.

Before playing in the NHL, Dryden played 2 seasons in the OHA playing for the Toronto St. Michael's.

In the NHL, he played for the New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks, Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers. Dryden faced his brother Ken in a game between his Sabres and the Montreal Canadiens. It was the only time in the history of the NHL that brothers opposed each other as goalies.

Dryden was the goalie against whom Wayne Gretzky scored his first professional goal. During his time in the WHA, he played for the Chicago Cougars and Edmonton Oilers. He won the Ben Hatskin Trophy as the WHA's top goaltender, and the Gordie Howe Trophy as league MVP.

Since retiring from playing professional ice hockey in 1979, he became the chair person of Sleeping Children Around the World charity which was founded by his father and provides bed kits to children in developing countries.
