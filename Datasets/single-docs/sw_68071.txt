Nelumbo

Nelumbo is a genus of water plants which are also known as lotus. Lotus flowers are large – up to 20 cm (8 inches) across – and they smell sweet.

The Sacred lotus of Asia has pink flowers. The American lotus has yellow flowers.

The lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the mud (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for respiration (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water.

People can eat lotus roots and seeds. Cattle (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers.

Lotuses look rather like water lilies from the Nymphaeaceae family.
