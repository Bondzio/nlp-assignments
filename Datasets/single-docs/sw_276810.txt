Ice lolly

An ice lolly, ice lollipop, or ice pop, is a frozen snack of flavoured ice. It is made by freezing flavoured liquid (such as fruit juice) around a wooden stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. In the United States, the snack also referred to as a popsicle after the brand.
