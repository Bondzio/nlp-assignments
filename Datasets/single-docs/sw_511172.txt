Chicago Principles

Chicago Principles refers to a set of guidelines on free expression developed by the University of Chicago. Besides the University of Chicago, several other American universities have adopted these guidelines. The name "Chicago Principles" was given by the president of Purdue University. The core concept of the Principles as originally expressed in terms of the University of Chicago is: "Except insofar as limitations on that freedom [i.e., "free and open inquiry in all matters" guaranteed to "all members of the University community" with "the broadest possible latitude to speak"] are necessary to the functioning of the University, the University of Chicago fully respects and supports the freedom of all members of the University community 'to discuss any problem that presents itself.'"
