Division of Adelaide

The Division of Adelaide is an Australian electoral division in South Australia. It includes the Adelaide city centre and the suburbs of Ashford, Clarence Park, Enfield, Goodwood, Kent Town, Keswick, Kilburn, Maylands, North Adelaide, Northgate, Norwood, Parkside, Prospect, Rose Park, St Peters, Toorak Gardens, Unley and Walkerville.

It was set up in 1903 and is named for the city of Adelaide, South Australia's capital, which was named for Queen Adelaide, wife of William IV.

Ernest Roberts was elected in 1908 after a by-election caused by the death of Charles Kingston. Kingston, a former Premier of South Australia, had been elected in 1903 unopposed. However Roberts died in 1913 which also caused a by-election. In 1988 Chris Hurford resigned to become the Australian Consul-General in New York, which also caused a by-election.
