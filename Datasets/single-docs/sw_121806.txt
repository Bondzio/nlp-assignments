A Song of Ice and Fire

A Song of Ice and Fire is an award-winning series of fantasy books that were written by an American author, George R. R. Martin. Martin started writing the series in 1991, and the first book came out in 1996. Now there are five books in the series, and two more are planned. The series has been translated into more than twenty languages and is a best-seller, with the fourth volume reaching the top of the "New York Times" bestseller lists when it came out.

A fictional language called "Dothraki" was created for the series. It was adapted and improved when the HBO series "Game of Thrones" was created.
