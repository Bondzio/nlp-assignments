Peaceful coexistence

Peaceful coexistence was a theory developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War that said that capitalist states could 'accept' each other. The idea of peaceful coexistence came from before the Communist leader Stalin’s death, as Georgy Malenkov called for it in 1952 but it was more clear after Stalin’s death in 1953 where destalinization (removing the personality and politics of Stalin) began.
