B'Day

B'Day is the second studio album by American R&B singer Beyoncé, released by Columbia Records on 1 September 2006 outside North America, on September 4, 2006 worldwide, and on September 5, 2006 in Canada and the United States.

A two-CD deluxe edition of the album, including previously unreleased material in English and Spanish, was released on April 3 2007. 6 singles were released from the album: "Déjà Vu", "Ring the Alarm", "Irreplaceable", "Beautiful Liar", "Get Me Bodied", and "Green Light".
