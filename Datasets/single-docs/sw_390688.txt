List of genetic disorders

This is a list of the most common genetic disorders in humans. If known, the type of mutation is shown, and the chromosome involved.


Many other conditions are known to be partly or wholly inherited, but their genetic basis is not yet clear. A good example is "clefting" (cleft lip and palate), which occurs up to 4 per 1000 in Native Americans and some Asian populations, but which is almost unknown in African populations. About 20 genes are under investigation.
