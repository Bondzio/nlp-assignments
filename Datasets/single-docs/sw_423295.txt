Andreja Pejić (born 28 August 1991) is an Australian model and actress.

She was born in Tuzla, Bosnia. During the Bosnian War she and her older brother Igor, mother, and grandmother fled to a refugee camp in Serbia. After the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia, Pejić's mother felt unsafe and in 2000 the family moved to Melbourne.

Pejić was born male. She models both male and female clothing. Her website describes her as transgender. She was signed to Storm Models in February 2012. She has appeared on the cover of Russian Vogue and Elle Serbia. In February 2013 she appeared in the video for David Bowie's single "The Stars (Are Out Tonight)". In October 2013 an interview with her was published by "La Monda" magazine. In it she said publicly for the first time that she likes people calling her 'she' more than 'he' or other gender pronouns. In early 2014 she had sex reassignment surgery.

Her boyfriend is Rembrandt Duran.
