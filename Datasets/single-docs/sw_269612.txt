Fish pie

Fish pie is a savory pie that has fish in it. It is normally eaten by British people, and made with white fish (cod, haddock, or halibut) in a white sauce. Hard boiled eggs are sometimes added as well, and the pie is made in a deep dish. The fish is not covered by a pie crust, but there are mashed potatos over it instead. The pie is sometimes also called the "fisherman's pie" because it is similar to the shepherd's pie.
