Degree of unsaturation

Degree of unsaturation (DOU) is a way to figure out how many rings or double bonds are in a molecule.


Each degree either equals one ring structure or pi bond. A double bond would have one DOU. A triple bond would have a DOU of two (triple bond is one sigma bond with two pi bonds).

For the below, use the same rules as above, using the definitions below.
