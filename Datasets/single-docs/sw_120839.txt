Harappa

Harappa () is an archaeological site in Punjab, northeast Pakistan. It is about 35Â km (22 miles) southwest of Sahiwal. A village with the same name is located about 6 kilometres from the site. About 15,000 people live there. In 2005, an amusement park scheme was abandoned during the early stages of building work.

The site contains the ruins of a city from the Bronze Age. The people living in Harappa were part of the Indus Valley Civilization.
