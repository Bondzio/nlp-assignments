Stan (song)

"Stan" is the third single from "The Marshall Mathers LP", Eminem's third album. It was No. 1 in the UK and Australia. It is about an Eminem fan who kills himself after Eminem does not respond to his letters. Devon Sawa plays the fan in the music video. Eminem performed the song at the 2001 Grammy Awards. Elton John played the piano at the performance. The album version of the song is 6 minutes and 39 seconds long. The video is 8 minutes and 15 seconds. On "The Marshall Mathers LP 2", the song "Bad Guy" is a sequel to "Stan"; it is about Stan's brother, Matthew, taking revenge on Eminem.
