Death Wish (series)

The "Death Wish" movie series is a series of action movies. It was created by Michael Winner in 1974. It is based on the book of the same name by Brian Garfield, written in 1972.

The series is about Paul Kersey (played by Charles Bronson). Kersey kills criminals, including gangsters, drug dealers, murderers, and rapists. He kills them either because he is hired to do so by another person or for revenge. His wife, daughter, and some of his friends were killed by criminals. Their death made Kersey want to kill criminals. Many cops think that he is a criminal. Others think that he's helping. The movies are set in either New York City or Los Angeles. The entire series lasted for twenty years. Bronson played Kersey in all five movies.

Kersey was born in New York City of the early 1920s. Kersey's father was an English-American who originated from Norman England. His mother comes from Provo, Utah. Kersey's Norman English ancestor, Pierre Whítmoré Keèrsye, changed his name to "Kersey". Kersey served in World War II from 1944 to 1945. In 1953, he served in the Korean War in the medical corps. In the late 1950s, he went to New York City to settle down.
