Alternative medicine

Alternative medicine describes practices used in place of conventional medical treatments. Some patients seek these practices along with conventional medicine.

Alternative medicine includes practices that incorporate spiritual, metaphysical, or religious belief; non-evidence based practices, non-European medical traditions, or newly developed approaches to healing. 

Examples include acupuncture, chiropractic and homeopathy.
