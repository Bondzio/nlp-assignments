Jennifer Government: NationStates

NationStates is an browser game where you run your own country. It was made by an Australian man called Max Barry and the idea for it was from his book "Jennifer Government". It came out on 13 November 2002. There was a sequel, NationStates 2, but it is now closed.

In the beginning, you create your own country. On the first page, you choose your name, flag, motto, type of money, and government type. On the next page, the answers decide the first rankings of your nation. The new country starts with a population of 5 million and rises every day.

Issues are one of the most important parts of the game. For an issue, you have to choose an option to solve a problem in your country. Also, you can just click "dismiss" to ignore it. None are the right one, as each one has it's downsides. After the 30 original issues, Max Barry realized that more were needed so he gave players with a population of over 500 million an option to send him their own issue ideas.

The way you choose the solutions to the issues changes your civil rights, political freedoms and economy rankings. The names of the rankings can be seen below:

Based on these, each country is placed in one of 27 categories, such as Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, Scandinavian Liberal Paradise and Corporate Police State.
NationStates also has forums where any of the players can discuss and debate about many different things.

Some of the players might not be as interested in debates, and would prefer to roleplay instead. There are subforums for players of each type.
