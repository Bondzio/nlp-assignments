Acherontia styx

Acherontia styx is a Sphingid moth found in Asia, one of the three species of Death's-head Hawkmoth, also known as the "Bee Robber".

An "Acherontia styx" pupa found in the soft palate of a murder victim is a vital clue in the thriller novel The Silence of the Lambs; in "The Silence of the Lambs" movie version, however, while the script still refers to "styx", the species used is "Acherontia atropos".
