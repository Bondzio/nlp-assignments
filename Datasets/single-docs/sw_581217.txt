Mbah Gotho

Saparman Sodimejo, known more commonly as Mbah Gotho (born, reportedly, 31 December 1870 â€“ 30 April 2017) was an Indonesian man who unverifiably claimed to be the oldest person ever recorded. 

In May 2010, "Solopos" reported that the 1870 census had recorded his age next birthday as 142, which would make him 19 years older than the official oldest recorded person, Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997.

The "Liputan 6" website reported that Mbah Gotho's estimated age was 140, that he could not remember his date of birth but claimed to remember the construction of a sugar factory built in Sragen in 1880.

In August 2016, after a television report on "Liputan 6", numerous international media outlets reported Gotho's claim, including photographs of his ID card (issued in 2014), which displays his claimed birth date. 

Although Indonesian officials at the local record office confirm the birth date there is no independent, third-party verification of his claimed age, which is required for the longevity claim to be recognized by record authorities such as Guinness World Records. 

The Gerontology Research Group said the claimed age was "fiction", "unbelievable" and "in the same category as Sasquatch ["Bigfoot"], the Yeti, and the Loch Ness Monster". The 2010 "Liputan 6" story noted others of a similar claimed age including a woman named Maemunah and known as Ambu Unah, supposedly born in 1867, in Cimanuk, Pandeglang Regency.

On 28 April 2017, he was admitted to RSUD Hospital for heart failure in Sragen and died two days later at 5:45 pm local time on 30 April 2017.
