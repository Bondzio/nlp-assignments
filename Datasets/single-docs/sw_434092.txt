Childfree

The term childfree means people who choose not to have children. It includes people who have had surgery (such as a vasectomy) to make themselves unable to have children.

The most common reasons for being childfree are:


People may also choose not to have children for ethical reasons. By choosing not to have their own children, childfree people have choices of saving large amounts of money. They can also focus on themselves. They usually benefit society more by being childless rather than having children.

Being childless was considered unusual in the 1950s. Since then, the number of adults without children has increased. Many researchers say childfree adults are more educated, less likely to be religious and more likely to live around cities. In the late 2000s to early 2010s, the rate of women in the United States becoming pregnant dropped almost 9%. The birth rate between 2010 and 2013 was the lowest in the country's history.
