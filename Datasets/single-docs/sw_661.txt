Raw food

Foods are raw when they are not cooked. 
Most things are good to eat raw, but some can be poisonous. 

There's currently no solid evidence to suggest that raw food is more healthy than cooked food.

Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of bacteria which would otherwise be destroyed by cooking.
