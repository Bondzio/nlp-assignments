Mandarin duck

The mandarin duck ("Aix galericulata") breeds in eastern Siberia, China and Japan and winters in southern China and Japan. There is a small free-flying population in Britain stemming from the release captive bred ducks.

In full plumage, the male has a pair of "sail" feathers that are raised vertically above the back, a crest of orange and cream feathers, and a broad white eye-stripe that is bounded above and below by darker feathers. The female is duller in color and has an overall grey appearance marked by a curving white stripe behind the eye and a series of white blotches on the underparts. In flight, both sexes display a bluish-green iridescent speculum.

The mandarin lives in the forests of China and Japan. They prefer wooded ponds and fast flowing rocky streams to swim, wade, and feed in.
