Walter Sutton

Walter Stanborough Sutton (5 April 1877 – 10 November 1916) was an American biologist and surgeon. Sutton was born in Utica, New York and raised in Russell, Kansas. He got Bachelors and Masters degres from the University of Kansas. Sutton then went to Columbia University and got his doctorate in medicine in 1907.

In 1903 Sutton suggested that chromosomes, which segregate in a Mendelian fashion, are hereditary units. Edmund B. Wilson (1856–1939), Sutton's teacher, and the author of one of the most famous text-books in biology, called this the "Sutton–Boveri hypothesis".
