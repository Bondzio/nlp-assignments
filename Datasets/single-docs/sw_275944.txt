Shinji Ikari is a main character from the Japanese cartoon "Neon Genesis Evangelion." He is a teenage boy who pilots a giant robot, called Evangelion Unit 01, to fight huge monsters called Angels.

Shinji Ikari (碇シンジ, born in 6th June, 2001) is 14 years old during "Neon Genesis Evangelion". His father is Gendo Ikari (碇ゲンドウ) and his mother is Yui Ikari (碇ユイ), but Shinji grew up without them. Yui died when Shinji was a small child, and Gendo left Shinji so he could be in charge of NERV.
