Rotten Tomatoes

Rotten Tomatoes is a website dedicated to reviews, information, and news of movies. The name derives from the vaudeville-era clich√© of throwing tomatoes and other products at stage performers if a performance was particularly bad. The company has been owned by Flixster, a Warner Bros. company, since May 2011.

As of 2007, the website's editor-in-chief is Matt Atchity.

Rotten Tomatoes was launched on August 12, 1998, as a spare time project by Senh Duong. His goal in creating Rotten Tomatoes was "to create a site where people can get access to reviews from a variety of critics in the US".
