Marina is classed as a New Wave artist by critics. She is mostly known for her pop, electronic and more alternative music.

Diamandis was born in Abergavenny, Wales. Her mother is Welsh and her father is Greek. Her parents separated when Marina was sixteen and she moved to Greece to live with her father but returned to Wales two years later.

Marina first used MySpace to release music and she released two EPs before releasing her debut album. She was signed to Neon Records in 2008.

Marina's stage name is a mix of her first name and "the Diamonds", which she says represents her fans rather than her backing band.
