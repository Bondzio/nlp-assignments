Kepler conjecture

The Kepler conjecture is a mathematical conjecture, about Sphere packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is named after Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who first had this idea. Kepler supposed that the ways to pack spheres of equal size that result in the packing with the highest density are face-centered cubic or hexagonal packings. These packings have a density of slightly over 74 percent, this means that they fill about 74 percent of space available.
