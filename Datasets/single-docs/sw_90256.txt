Vergeletto

Vergeletto is a municipality of the district Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. On 10 April 2016 the former municipalities of Vergeletto, Gresso, Isorno and Mosogno merged into the municipality of Onsernone.

Since 1803, the municipality of Vergeletto also contained the current municipality of Gresso. Both municipalities were moved away from each other in 1882. 

The coat of arms of the municipality are taken from the Garbani, or Garban family for its French and Northern American branch, starting from the village, who are people who sell things or people of power.
