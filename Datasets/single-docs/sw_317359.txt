Ōnin

In the "Ōnin" era, the emperor gave Yoshimasa's villa with a special name -- "Higashiyama-dono"., Construction work was interrupted by the Ōnin War.

The "Ōnin" War started in 1467. This conflict is called "Ōnin no ran" because of the nengō in which it began. The fighting began as a dispute over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement – whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa). 
Rival groups of daimyo fought for military supremacy. In the end, there was no winner. The war stopped because the factions simply exhausted themselves.
