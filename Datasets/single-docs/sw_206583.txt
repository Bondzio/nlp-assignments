Stede Bonnet

Stede Bonnet (c. 1688 â€“ December 10, 1718) was an early 18th-century Barbadian pirate, sometimes called "the gentleman pirate" because he was a moderately rich landowner before turning to a life of crime. Bonnet was captured and was executed by hanging at White Point Garden, in Charleston, South Carolina on 10 December 1718.
