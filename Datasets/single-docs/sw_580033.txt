Shape of You

"Shape of You" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. It is the first single from his third studio album, "÷" ("divide"). It was released on January 6, 2017. "Shape of You" has reached number one on the charts of several countries, including entering at the top of the charts in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia. It became Sheeran's first number-one song in the US. Before, he reached number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in 2015 with the single "Thinking Out Loud".

On Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), a website that shows the royalties and songwriters/publishers of songs, Sheeran added the songwriters of TLC's "No Scrubs" (1999). This is because lines from both songs have a similar rhythm.

The music video for "Shape of You", directed by Jason Koenig, was released on 30 January 2017 and features American actress Jennie Pegouski and retired sumo wrestler Yamamotoyama Ryūta.

"Shape of You" has reached the number one position in 38 countries. It is one of the most successful songs in world history, having charted at the number one position for 10 weeks or more on the national singles charts in 16 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. The song has charted for 15 weeks on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart, becoming the longest-running number one single on a national singles chart in Australian history. In Canada, the song charted at number one for 16 weeks, becoming one of the two longest-running number one singles in Canadian history, with the other being the Black Eyed Peas' 2009 single "I Gotta Feeling".
