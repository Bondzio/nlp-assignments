José Marrone

José Carlos Marrone (October 25, 1915 in Buenos Aires – June 27, 1990 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine actor and comedian.

Marrone was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

His career began when he performed as a vaudeville in theaters and the radio. He hosted several children-oriented TV shows, such as "El Circo de Marrone" (Marrone's Circus), playing the clown character "Pepitito". His recurring catchphrase was 
"Cheee!".

He married twice and had a daughter, "Coqui", with his first wife, Rosa. Still married, Marrone fell in love with Juanita Martínez, but they waited to get together until Rosa died. 

Marrone died in Buenos Aires, Argentina from a heart attack, aged 74.

In 2001, a decade after Marrone's death, Juanita committed suicide, and her body was found with a picture of Marrone in her hands.
