Mastodon

Mastodons or Mastodonts are elephants of the extinct genus "Mammut" and the family Mammutidae. Mastodons became extinct about 11,000 years ago. 

Mastodons, with mammoths, modern elephants and various older families, are members of the order Proboscidea. As adults they stood between 2.5 and 3 meters (8-10 feet) at the shoulder and weighed between 3500 and 5400 kilograms (4-6 tons). 

Mastodons were browsers on leaves and branches, as shown by their molar teeth.

Stone tools and bones from a butchered mastodon were found at the bottom of a river in Florida. After a four-year investigation, researchers decided that humans lived there and made a meal of a mastodon 14,550 years ago.
