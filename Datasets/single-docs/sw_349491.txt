BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award

The BAFTA Fellowship is a lifetime achievement award presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). It has been given since 1971 "in recognition of outstanding achievement in the art forms of the moving image", and is the highest honour the Academy can give. Fellowship recipients have been mostly film directors, but some have also been awarded to actors, movie and television producers, cinematographers, film editors, and screenwriters.
