Der er et yndigt land

"Der er et yndigt land" ("There is a Lovely Country") is the national anthem of Denmark. It is written in 1819 by the Danish poet Adam Oehlensläger.
The music was composed by H.E. Krøyer, in 1835. The anthem is one of Denmark's two official national anthems. The other one, "Kong Christian stod ved højen mast",
is known as the royal anthem, while this anthem is regarded as the people's national anthem.
