Jecheon AIDS scandal

Jecheon AIDS scandal or Jecheon AIDS crime was a well-known sex crime that happened in Jecheon, South Korea. A male taxi driver was arrested by the police on 13 March 2009 for knowingly spreading HIV/AIDS to dozens of women in Jecheon between 2003 and 2009.

The offender was Mr. Jeon, a 27-year-old taxi driver who has HIV. He had sex with many women over five to six years, despite knowing his condition. The police said that his partners included drunken taxi passengers as well as bar girls he came to know while working as a driver. Many of the women were married women, housewives, or divorcees. Jeon rarely used condoms, according to local media.

Jeon said that he had had sex with ten women, but a survey estimated the number at between 70 to 400. His mobile phone, which had been confiscated by police, contained the phone numbers of about seventy women.
