Oedipina maritima

Oedipina maritima is a species of worm salamander that lives on the island of Escudo de Veraguas. It has no natural predators, as only a few animals live on the island, but it is endangered due to deforestation.

There are only eight known adult specimens and two clutches of eggs.

The only threat to the salamander is deforestation.
