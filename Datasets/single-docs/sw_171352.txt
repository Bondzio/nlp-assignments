Holyrood Palace

The Palace of Holyroodhouse, also known as Holyrood Palace, founded as a monastery by David I of Scotland in 1128, has served as the main home of the Kings and Queens of Scotland since the fifteenth century. The Palace stands in Edinburgh, at the bottom of the Royal Mile. The Palace of Holyroodhouse is the official home in Scotland of 
Queen Elizabeth II, who spends time at the Palace at the beginning of the summer.

Holyrood is an anglicisation of the Scots "Haly Ruid" (Holy Cross).
Pope Benedict XVI visited Queen Elizabeth II on 16th September 2010 on his first day of his Official Papal visit to the United Kingdom. He then went on to say mass at Glasgow's Beallahouston Park.
