Argentine National Anthem

The lyrics of the Himno Nacional Argentino (the national anthem of Argentina) were written by Vicente López y Planes, and the music was composed by Blas Parera. This song was adopted as the national anthem on May 11, 1813, three years before the formal declaration of independence from Spain. May 11 is therefore "Anthem Day" in Argentina.

The following is the modern version, adopted in 1900, without the vivid attacks against Spain.

2008 comprehensive translation, adapted for the tune
"Same meaning, somehow more positive"

O'Hear "Mortals" these sacred words...
"We Are Free!, We Are Free!, We Are Free!"
O'Hear the sounds of broken old chains,
See enthroned our great noble Flag!
Her glorious passage was for us unveiled,
By "The United Provinces of the South".
And the world's free men now respond...
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"
And the world's free men now respond...
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"
And the world's free men now respond...
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"

"Chorus"

May these Laurels be eternal,
Well we knew how to fetch them.
Well we knew how to fetch them.
Let us all live crowned with Glory,
Or full with Glory, let's swear to die.
Full with Glory, let's swear to die.
Full with Glory, let's swear to die.

The original version, "Marcha Patriótica", is as follows:
