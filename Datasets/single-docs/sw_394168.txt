"Pikmin 3" has the same gameplay as the last 2 "Pikmin" games. Players control 100 plant-like creatures called Pikmin. The player uses them to pick up object, reach areas, and fight enemies. There are three characters that players can play as. In addition to the five types of Pikmin from "Pikmin 2" (Red Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, Blue Pikmin, Purple Pikmin, and White Pikmin), there is two new types of Pikmin. The Rock Pikmin can destroy tough barriers, while the Flying Pink "Winged" Pikmin can attack airborne enemies and carry items in the air.

The player is able to control the game with the Wii U GamePad or the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination. The Wii U GamePad gives the player a map of the game environment, which is visible on its touch screen.
