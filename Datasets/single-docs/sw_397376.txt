Container ship

A Container ship is a cargo ship that is used to carry standard Intermodal containers. They are common. Most cargo ships that do not carry bulk goods are container ships. The containers come in different sizes. In general, the load they can carry is measured in Twenty-foot equivalent units (abbreviated "TEU"). A twenty-foot container is 1 TEU, a forty-foot container is 2 TEU.
