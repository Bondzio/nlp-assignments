Ford Taurus X

The Ford Taurus X (originally called Ford Freestyle before 2008) was a six or seven passenger crossover that was produced in the United States by the Ford Motor Company. The Taurus X was phased out in the 2009 model year, and succeeded by the Ford Flex which overlapped production with the Taurus X until it was discontinued.
