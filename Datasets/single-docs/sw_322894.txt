No Motherland Without You

No Motherland Without You is a North Korean song. It is the signature song of Kim Jong-il. The song tells of the talent and virtues of Jong-il, and the attachment of the Korean people for him. The song's chorus is "We cannot exist without you, Comrade Kim Jong-il! The motherland cannot exist without you!" It is also thought to be the anthem of Songun politics because Jong-il started the Songun (military-first) policy of North Korean politics in 1995. It is often broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang.

The official lyrics use the phrase "김정일동지" ("Comrade Kim Jong-il") to refer to the son of Kim Il-sung. The current usage of the song refers to the North Korean leader as "김정일장군" ("General Kim Jong-il") because he was the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army since 1991. The lyrics used by the Korean Workers' Party are as follows:
