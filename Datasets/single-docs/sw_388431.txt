Opel Mokka

The Opel Mokka is a car from the German carmaker Opel since 2012. The Mokka is a subcompact crossover SUV, and rides on GM's Gamma platform, which is the same platform the Chevrolet Aveo/Sonic and Spark are built on. The Mokka is sold as the Buick Encore and Chevrolet Trax in North America and is sold as a Vauxhall in the UK. The Opel/Vauxhall versions have recently been facelifted and are now called Mokka X.
