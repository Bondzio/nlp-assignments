Antenna (biology)

Antennae (singular antenna) are paired feelers (appendages) connected to the front segments of crustaceans and insects. They are found on the first two segments of the head. The smaller pair is known as antennules. 

Antennae are jointed and extend forward from the head. They are sensory organs. The organ may sense touch, air motion, heat, vibration (sound), and especially olfaction (smell) or gustation (taste).
