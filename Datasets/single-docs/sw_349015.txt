Salafi

A Salafi is a Muslim who thinks Islam should be practiced the way the first few generations of Muslims did. The term is also used to talk about certain teachings of Sunni Islam that are based on "conservative" ideals. Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905) was an Islamic scholar who thought that the values of Islam were compatible with a modern lifestyle. He is often labeled as a Salafi. Another scholar, Ibn Taimiya (1263-1328) is often seen as the father of modern radicalised Islamism. He said that the teachings of Islam were not compatible with certain modern interpretations, such as Sufism. Fundamentalist Islamic people, especially in the West, are often identified as Salafi.
