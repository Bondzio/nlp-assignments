Base Ball Bear

Base Ball Bear is a Japanese rock band from Tokyo, Japan. Base Ball Bear has four members in the band; the current band members are Yūsuke Koide, Shōhei Yuasa, Shiori Sekine and Daisuke Horinouchi.

The band was formed by four friends and was originally called, Planet and was formed for a one-time performance at a high school culture festival but they decided to continue playing because of how well they were received at the festival and because of how much fun they were having. The band was informed by Toshiba EMI to change their name after sending their demo tapes to record labels and they chose Base Ball Bear which they got from Chocolate's song, Base Ball and Elvis Presley. The band currently has Yūsuke Koide on Vocals and guitar, Shōhei Yuasa on guitar, Shiori Sekine on bass guitar and backing vocals and Daisuke Horinouchi on drums and chorus.
