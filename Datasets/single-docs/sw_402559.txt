Carl Adolph Agardh

Carl Adolph Agardh was a Swedish botanist and bishop of Karlstad. He was known for his extensive work on algae.

Agardh was born on 23 January 1785 in Båstad, a town in Scania (), Sweden. He began to study at Lund University in 1799.

In 1807, Agardh became a teacher of mathematics at Lund. In 1812, he was appointed professor of botany and rural economy. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1817, and of the Swedish Academy in 1831.

Agardh became a Lutheran clergyman in 1816. He was a member of the Swedish Parliament on several occasions from 1817. He was "rector magnificus" of Lund University from 1819 to 1820. In 1835 he became the bishop of Karlstad, where he remained until his death. He died on 28 January 1859 in Karlstad.

Agardh devoted considerable attention to political economy. As "a leading liberal", he "succeeded in improving and raising the standards of education in Sweden". He wrote on theological and other subjects, but he is best known for his botanical works, especially "Systema algarum", "Species algarum rite cognitae", and "Icones Algarum" (1824, 1820–28, and 1828–35). He translated into German most of his "Manual of Botany" (2 vols., Malmoe, 1829–32)

Agardh was the father of Jacob Georg Agardh, also a botanist.
