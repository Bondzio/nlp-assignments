Belize at the Olympics

Belize was first at the Olympic Games in 1968. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics. The nation has never been in the Winter Olympic Games. From 1968 to 1972, Belize was known by its colonial name of British Honduras.

As of 2011, no athlete from Belize has ever won an Olympic medal.

The National Olympic Committee for Belize was formed in 1967 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee that same year.
