Anagram

An anagram is a puzzle where the player has to move all the letters in a word to make a new word. An example would be "The Morse Code" and "Here Comes Dots". Anagrams are often used in fiction when a character wants to use a different name. For example, the "Harry Potter" character named Tom Marvolo Riddle made an anagram based on his name, ""I Am Lord Voldemort"", and began calling himself "Lord Voldermort".
