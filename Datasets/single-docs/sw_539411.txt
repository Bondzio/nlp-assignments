Pierre-Joseph Redouté

Pierre-Joseph Redouté (10 July 1759 in Saint-Hubert – 19 June 1840 in Paris) was a painter and botanist from the Southern Netherlands. He is known for his watercolours of roses, lilies and other flowers. He was nicknamed "the Raphael of flowers" and has been called the greatest botanical illustrator of all time. Many of the species he painted had never been illustrated before.

He was an official court artist of Queen Marie Antoinette, and he continued painting through the French Revolution and Reign of Terror.

For fifty years, Redouté was the drawing teacher to French queens and princesses. He dedicated "Choix des plus belles fleurs" to two of his students, Louise and Marie d’Orléans. Later, Marie d’Orléans became the first queen of the Belgians.
