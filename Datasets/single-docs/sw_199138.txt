ECW December to Dismember

December to Dismember was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event first held by the original Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1995 as a non-televised Supercard event.

In 2006 it was revived by the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as a PPV and held under its ECW brand. It was the second of two brand only events, the first being One Night Stand in June 2006. The second December to Dismember was originally meant to be held the following year on December 2, 2007, however it was cancelled in February 2007 due to unknown reasons after the WWE PPV's became tri-branded.
