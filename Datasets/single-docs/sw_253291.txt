Red pine

The Red Pine ("Pinus resinosa") is a pine native to northeastern North America. The Red Pine grows in the area from Newfoundland west to southeast Manitoba, and south to northern Illinois and Pennsylvania, with a small outlying population in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. In the Upper Midwest of the United States it is sometimes known by the confusing name Norway Pine even though it is not native to Norway.
It is the state tree of Minnesota.
