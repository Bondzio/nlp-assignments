Pike (weapon)

A pike is a pole weapon. It is a very long heavy thrusting spear formerly used by infantry. A pike is not intended to be thrown. Pikes were used regularly in European warfare starting in the early Middle Ages. Until around 1700 pikes were used by foot soldiers in close order formations.
The pike was a long weapon that got longer over time. It could be as long as 20 feet. It had a wooden shaft with an iron or steel . It had metal along the sides for three feet behind the tip to keep it from being cut off by a sword or axe.
When a number of pikes are used together it allowed a great concentration of spearheads an enemy could not get through. The length also kept the soldier at a greater distance. But the length also made pikes difficult to use in close combat. were usually arranged in a very close tight formation of several lines deep. The earliest of these were called a phalanx formation. It was used by the Macedonians under Philip II of Macedon. It was used by the armies of the Pharoahs in ancient Egypt. It was later used by the Swiss pike columns but this formation was probably based on the Scottish Schildrons. The armies of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce used it to great success against the heavy cavalry of kings Edward I of England and his son Edward II of England.
