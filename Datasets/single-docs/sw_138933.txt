The European Ford Escort was a car made by Ford Motor Company from 1968 through 2002. In UK the Four-door saloon and the Three-door hatchback was discontinued in 1998. The first generation was produced from 1968 to 1974. The second generation was made from 1974 to 1980. The third generation was made from 1980 to 1986, it was the first Escort to offer hatchback models as well as front-wheel drive, it was mildly updated in 1983 with a 5-door estate added and also spawned a saloon version called the Orion. The fourth generation arrived in 1986 and was made until 1990. The fifth generation appeared in September 1990 and was criticised by the motoring press due to its bland styling, dull drive and old engines but it was still a strong seller, it got a facelift in 1992. The sixth and final generation arrived in early 1995 and was replaced by the Focus in late 1998, although the Escort continued alongside it with a reduced range until 2000 with the vans being discontinued in 2002. 

Ford launched the Focus in 1998. It was supposed to replace the Escort, which was now 30 years old. However, the Escort wasn't fully discontinued until 2000. The van version continued on until 2002 when it was replaced with the Transit Connect.

This shows how the Ford Escort has changed each generation.
