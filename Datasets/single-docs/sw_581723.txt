Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas

Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Solórzano (; born May 1, 1934) is a Mexican politician. He was a former Head of Government of the Federal District and a founder of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). 

Cárdenas ran for the presidency of Mexico three times. His 1988 loss to the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate by the narrowest of margins had long been considered a direct result of electoral fraud, later acknowledged by President Miguel de la Madrid. 

Cárdenas previously served as a Senator, having been elected in 1976 to represent the state of Michoacán and also as the Governor of Michoacán between 1980-1986.
