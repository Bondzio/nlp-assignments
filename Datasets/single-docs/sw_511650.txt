Empire of Brazil

The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century country that covered the areas of modern Brazil and Uruguay. Brazil was
originally a colony of the Portuguese Empire but became its center when the Prince Regent João VI fled the French invasion of Portugal in 1808. When João returned to Portugal he left his son Pedro as regent of the autonomous Kingdom of Brazil.
On 7 September 1822, Pedro declared Brazil to be an independent Empire with himself as Emperor. However he abdicated in 1831 in favour of his young son Pedro II whose reign saw three international wars and decades of economic prosperity. However Pedro II did not have a male heir and the Empire ended on 15 November 1889 when the Emperor was overthrown in a "coup d'état" by the military.
