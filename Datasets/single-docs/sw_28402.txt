Penjing

Penjing (盆景 pinyin: pén jǐng, literally tray scenery) is the ancient Chinese art of growing trees and plants in containers. The plants are kept small by skilled pruning.

Penjing is similar to the Japanese art of bonsai.

The first historical reference to "penjing" is from the 9th century.
