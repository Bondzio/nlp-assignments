Sakurajima

The eruptions of this mountain have been recorded many times in history. Great Taisho(大正) eruption in 1914 connected this island to peninsula. 58 people were killed and 112 people were injured. These days, we can see a lot of eruptions.
The information about which way the wind blows is important to know if ash is falling or not. So, Kagoshima weather forecast report it. People in Sakurajima take a drill to escape from the island. Japan Meteorological Agency watches this mountain all days. We can see the latest picture from these cameras at JMA's website.
