Saintonge

Saintonge () is a small region and historical province on the Atlantic coast of France. It is within the "d√©partement" Charente-Maritime, west and south of Charente in the administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
Saintonge gets its name from the ancient Gallic tribe of the "Santones" who lived in this area. The capital is the city of Saintes.

The Saintonge was the center of the French Huguenots. Today, the region is famous for its production of the grapes that are used to produce cognac and Pineau des Charentes. Corn and fruit are also produced here. Salt was produced here which was considered at the time the best in France.

It was the birthplace of the explorer Jean Allefonsce and Samuel de Champlain who founded Quebec.

Saintongeais is spoken in the former provinces of Saintonge, Aunis, and Angoumois
