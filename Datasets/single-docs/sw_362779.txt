Islam in Albania

During the Ottoman rule, the majority of Albanians were of Muslim affiliation (Sunni and Bektashi). However, decades of state atheism which ended in 1991 brought a decline in religious practice in all traditions. 

A recent Pew Research Center demographic study put the percentage of Muslims in Albania at 79.9%.
