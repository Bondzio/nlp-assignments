Exocrine gland

An exocrine gland excretes its product by way of a duct to some environment outside itself, inside the body or on a surface of the body. 

An endocrine gland is its counterpart. It secretes its essential product directly into the bloodstream or else by diffusion into its surrounding tissue where it often acts on cells near the release site.
