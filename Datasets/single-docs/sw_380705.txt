Zizan was asked to say sorry for something he said in the comedy Hantu Bonceng in September 2011. It was said to insult Islam. Dewan Pemuda PAS Malaysia condemned what they saw as a clear insult to Allah. They referred to Zizan saying "Ashaduanna Muhammadar...syaitan", which means "I bear witness that Muhammad is ... the devil". Ustaz Azhar Idrus, an Islamic leader in Terengganu, also asked Zizan to repent to Allah.
