Sumo

In sumo, a wrestler ("rikishi") attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (dohy≈ç) 4.55 metres in diameter. Also, the "rikishi" try to use their skill to force an opponent to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of his feet. 

Sumo tournaments take place in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka.

Sumo wrestlers ("sumotori") are ranked into a hierarchy based on win-loss statistics in competitive tournaments. 

Those who have earned the highest rank are grand champions ("yokuzuna").

Sumo has changed in modern times. Foreign-born wrestlers are part of the sport. For example, Konishiki and Akebono are Hawaiian-born athletes who earned places for themselves.

In 2008, Kotooshu from Bulgaria won a championship. In that same year, two top wrestlers, Asashoryu and Hakuho, were Mongolian. Hakuho won the Nagoya tournament with no losses, 15-0.
