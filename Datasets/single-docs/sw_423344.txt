Automatic behaviour

Automatic behaviour is the name for a set of actions that occur (or that continue to occur), without conscious thought. Usually, they are guided by a part of the nervous system that is called autonomic nervous system, or visceral nervous system. 

Many mental illnesses are characterized by certain forms of unwanted automatic behaviour.
