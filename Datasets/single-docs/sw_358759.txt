Legal status of tattooing in the United States

In the United States, there is no federal law stating a required age to be tattooed. When a person reaches the age of 18 in the U.S., they are legally considered an adult. Many states require that the person being tattooed is an adult over 18, but some states do allow people under that age to be tattooed with parental consent.

Individual tattooists may choose to set age restrictions for their business as a precaution against lawsuits. Most such tattooists will allow a parent or guardian to give written or oral consent in person. The artist may also choose to place addition restrictions, such as refusing "any" clients under a specific age even with parental consent, or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to tattoo a minor (such as refusing any work around intimate parts of the body).
