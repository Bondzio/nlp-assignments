Flag of Belize

The flag of Belize comes from the earlier flag of British Honduras. Britis Honduras is the name of Belize during the time the British ruled. 

The flag is royal blue. It has a white disc at the centre with the national coat of arms held by a white and a black man. They are surrounded by fifty mahogany leaves. The flag is bordered at top and bottom by two red stripes.

The colours on the flag are for the country's national parties. The People's United Party (PUP) uses the color blue. The United Democratic Party (Belize) (UDP) uses red.
