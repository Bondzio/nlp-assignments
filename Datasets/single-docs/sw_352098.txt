Typhoon Ike

Typhoon Ike was an incredibly damaging, deadly and catastropic super typhoon that caused in excess of 1400 lives lost and extreme damage. This typhoon crossed over the Philippines and eastern China in late August/early September 1984. The storm carried winds matching Category 4 hurricane level. The name Ike was then retired from use because of its impact over the area.
