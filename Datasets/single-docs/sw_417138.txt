Lisa Madigan

Lisa Madigan (born July 30, 1966) has been the 41st Attorney General of the US state of Illinois since 2003, when she became the first female attorney general for Illinois. 

She is a Democrat and the daughter of Michael Madigan, who has been Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives for most of the last 50 years.

On December 12, 2008, she attracted national attention after filing a motion with the Supreme Court of Illinois to remove Governor Rod Blagojevich from office. The motion was denied by the court without a hearing.

Madigan was born on July 30, 1966 in Chicago, Illinois. She studied at Georgetown University and at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. Madigan has been married to Pat Byrnes.

She was once said by "The New York Times" to be among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female President of the United States.

On July 14, 2013 Madigan, who was widely expected to run, announced she would not run for governor in 2014 because of her fatherâ€™s decision to stay in his post as speaker of the Illinois House, but that she would run for reelection instead.
