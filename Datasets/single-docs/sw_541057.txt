Episode

An episode is a singular part of a story, radio or television program, they often follow in an order. They are often 20- 40 minutes long, and follow the same storyline.

"Episode" comes from the Greek word "epeisodion" which refers to the spoken words between two songs in a Greek tragedy. The word was first used in English in 1773 to mean an "outstanding incident, experience." By the 1930s, the word was used to refer to each broadcast of a radio program that was part of a series.
