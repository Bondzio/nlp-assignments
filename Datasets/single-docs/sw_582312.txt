Love.Live.Life

Love.Live.Life is the third studio album to be released by British hip hop group N-Dubz, released on 29 November 2010, as a collaboration by All Around the World and Island Records. Following the release of the album the group announced an long-term break to focus on solo projects.

The group began recording the album following the success of their second album "Against All Odds". Due to the album being released in America, certain UK words like "Blood" and "You get me?" were removed from the final edit of the album, but the group's trademark phrase "Na, na, niii" stayed as the group did not want to lose the respect they had earned from their original fans.
