Iranian women's movement

The Iranian women's movement, also called the "Persian women's movement", involves the Iranian women's social movement for women's rights. The movement emerged after the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Semi secret associations took place and organized women's rights demonstrations and protests.

It lasted until 1910, when the first Women Journal was published by women, to 1933, when which the last women’s association was dissolved by the Reza Shah’s government. The women’s movement emerged again after the Iranian Revolution (1979). In some villages the parents must show proof of their daughters virginity on the wedding night.
