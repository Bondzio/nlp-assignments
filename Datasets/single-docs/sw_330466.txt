Meadowlawn (Alabama)

Meadowlawn is an antebellum (before the American Civil War) plantation house built in the Greek revival style. It is located in Lowndesboro, Alabama. The house is a two-story frame house with 13 fluted Doric columns on two sides. There are balconies over both main entrance doors with wrought iron railings.

Meadowlawn was built in 1853 for Squire George Thomas (1797-1867). The house was later sold to Fort Williamson. In 1905 the house was sold to Ransom Meadows (1846-1940). He was the last surviving Confederate veteran in Lowndes County. His daughter, Aline Meadows, (1880-1979) married Robert Bragg Hagood on April 3, 1907. Ransom Meadows deeded the house to the Hagoods. Mrs. Hagood named the house Meadowlawn. She lived in the house until her death at age 99. The house still remains in the Hagood family. It is a contributing property of the Lowndesboro Historic District. The District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1973.
