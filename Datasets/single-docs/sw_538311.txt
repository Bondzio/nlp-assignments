Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151

The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 is a type of train used by Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. It is one of the four types of electric multiple units on the North South and East West Lines.

The trains were introduced in 1987 and are still in operation. There are sixty-six trainsets with six cars each. There is a single money trainset with four cars that has been withdrawn from service. These trains are operated by SMRT Trains.

The trains were upgraded between 2006 and 2008, mainly to improve the trains' appearances. Most of the important parts for the trains' functioning were not replaced as they were still considered in good condition. However, due to what was considered one of the MRT's worst breakdowns in its history, a second upgrade was planned to replace these important parts, but the Land Transport Authority stopped the upgrades as they wanted to replace the trains entirely instead. Eventually, only two trains had these parts replaced.
