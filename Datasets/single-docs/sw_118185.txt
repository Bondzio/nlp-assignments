Golden Rooster Awards

The Golden Rooster Awards (; pinyin: Jīn Jī Jiăng) are awards in film given in mainland China. They are similar to the Academy Awards. It is called the Golden Rooster Awards because it was the Year of the Rooster in 1981. 

The people who get the award receive a statuette in the shape of a golden Rooster. They are picked by a group of movie makers, movie experts, and movie historians. The awards are given by the China Film Association.

At first the film festival had two events - the Golden Rooster festival and the Hundred Flowers Awards. The two festivals were combined in 1992. Now the Golden Rooster is awarded on odd years and the Hundred Flowers is awarded on even years.
